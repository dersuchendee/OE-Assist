**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the subject of a source. The ontology includes classes and properties related to sources and subjects, but it lacks a direct connection or property that would allow us to extract the subject of a source without additional information or context. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?source ?subject
WHERE {
  ?source a :Cl_Source .
  ?source :op_hasSubject ?subject .
}
```
