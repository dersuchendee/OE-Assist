**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the publication date of a book or CD. However, we can extract partial information about publications, such as their titles.

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?title
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  OPTIONAL { ?publication :title ?title . }
}
```
