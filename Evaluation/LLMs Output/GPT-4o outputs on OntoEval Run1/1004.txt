**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a book or CD. The ontology includes classes and properties related to books, CDs, and publications, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific book or CD and its publication date. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for books or CDs, but without the publication date.

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?bookOrCD a :Cl_CD . }
}
```
