**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the publication date of books or CDs. However, it does contain information about publications in general, including their titles and types. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for the titles and types of publications.

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?title ?type
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  ?publication :publicationTitle ?title .
  ?publication :publicationType ?type .
}
```
