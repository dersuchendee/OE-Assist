**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a specific book or CD. However, we can extract partial information about publications and their types.

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?publicationTitle ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  OPTIONAL { ?publication :publicationTitle ?publicationTitle . }
  OPTIONAL { ?publication :publicationDate ?publicationDate . }
}
```
