The competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:publicationDate` property for both `:Cl_Book` and `:Cl_CD` classes, which allows us to query the publication date of books and CDs.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the publication date of books and CDs:

```sparql
SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?item a ?type .
  FILTER(?type IN (:Cl_Book, :Cl_CD)) .
  ?item :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?item
```

This query retrieves the publication date of each book or CD, along with their labels if available.
