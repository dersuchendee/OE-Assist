The competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:publicationDate` data property, which is associated with both `:Cl_Book` and `:Cl_CD` classes. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the publication date of a book or CD.

```sparql
SELECT ?item ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?item a ?type .
  FILTER(?type IN (:Cl_Book, :Cl_CD))
  ?item :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```
