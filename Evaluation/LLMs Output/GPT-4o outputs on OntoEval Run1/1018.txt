**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the specific date of a seminar event based on its title or other identifying features. The ontology only provides a single seminar event with a date, but it does not allow for querying multiple seminar events or identifying them by specific attributes.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_SeminarEvent .
  ?seminar :hasDate ?date .
}
```
