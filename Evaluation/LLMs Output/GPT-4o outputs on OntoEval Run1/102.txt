**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the specific location where a festival took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to events, locations, and theatre festivals, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific festival and its location. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :takesPlaceIn ?location . }
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve festivals and their locations, but without specific instances or data, it cannot provide a complete answer.
