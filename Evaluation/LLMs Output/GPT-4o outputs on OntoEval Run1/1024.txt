**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about seminars or their dates. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to events, but it will not specifically address seminars or their dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?eventDate
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  OPTIONAL { ?event :eventDate ?eventDate . }
}
```
