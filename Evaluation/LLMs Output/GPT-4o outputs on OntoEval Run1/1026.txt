**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific seminar took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars, such as `Cl_Seminar`, `seminarDate`, and `tookPlace`, but it lacks a direct connection to identify a specific seminar by name or other unique identifiers. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for all seminars and their dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?date .
}
```
