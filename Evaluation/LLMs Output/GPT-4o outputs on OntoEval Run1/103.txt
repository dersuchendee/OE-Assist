**No**

The ontology provided does not contain explicit information about the location of festivals, such as cities or theatres where they take place. Therefore, the competency question "Where did a certain festival take place?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to festivals and their associated productions.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?production
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasProduction ?production .
}
```
