The competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Seminar` with the property `seminarDate`, which allows us to query for the date of a seminar.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?date .
}
```
