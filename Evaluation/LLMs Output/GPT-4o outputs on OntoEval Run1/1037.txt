The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the date of a specific seminar. The ontology includes a class for seminars and a data property for seminar dates, but it lacks a mechanism to identify a specific seminar by name or other attributes that would allow us to query for its date. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information about seminars and their dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?date .
}
```
