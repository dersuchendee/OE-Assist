The competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Seminar` with a data property `seminarDate` that specifies the date of the seminar. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the seminar date.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?date .
}
```
