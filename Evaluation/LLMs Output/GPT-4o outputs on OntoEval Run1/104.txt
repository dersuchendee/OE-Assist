**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a festival. The `hasLocation` property is defined with `Cl_TheatreFestival` as its domain and `Cl_City` as its range, but there is no instance data provided in the ontology to query against. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for festivals and their associated locations, assuming such data exists.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :hasLocation ?location . }
}
```
