**No**

The ontology does not directly model the relationship between seminars and the articles presented in them. While there is a `ns1:presentedArticle` property that associates a presentation with an article, and a `ns1:partOfSeminar` property that associates a presentation with a seminar, there is no direct way to query which articles were presented in a specific seminar without additional information or assumptions.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the presentations associated with a seminar and then retrieving the articles associated with those presentations:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a ns1:Seminar .
  ?seminar ns1:hasPresentation ?presentation .
  ?presentation ns1:presentedArticle ?article .
}
```
