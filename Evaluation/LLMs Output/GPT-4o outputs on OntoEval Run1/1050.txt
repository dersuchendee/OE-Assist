**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate articles with specific seminars. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars and articles, but it lacks a direct connection between articles and the specific seminars they were presented at. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?article ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
}
```
