**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate articles with specific seminars. The ontology includes classes and properties for seminars, articles, and seminar presentations, but it lacks a direct link between articles and the seminars in which they were presented. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying articles and seminars separately, but not their direct association.

```sparql
SELECT ?article ?articleTitle ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle . }
  
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate . }
}
```
