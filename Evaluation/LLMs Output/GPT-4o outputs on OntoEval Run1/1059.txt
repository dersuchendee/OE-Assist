**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate articles with seminars. The ontology includes classes for `Cl_Article` and `Cl_Seminar`, but there is no direct object property linking articles to seminars. The closest relation is through `Cl_SeminarPresentation`, which is a subclass of both `Cl_Seminar` and `Cl_Article`, but it does not provide a direct link between an article and a seminar.

Partial answer SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?article ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
}
```

This query will list all articles and seminars, but it will not show which articles were presented in which seminars.
