**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate articles with specific seminars. While there is a `hasPresentedArticle` property linking seminars to articles, there is no explicit connection between seminars and specific articles presented in them. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract seminars and articles:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentedArticle ?article .
}
```
