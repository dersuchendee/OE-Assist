**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a seminar. The ontology includes classes and properties related to hospitals, seminars, and their relationships, but it does not explicitly link seminars to specific locations or provide a property that indicates where a seminar took place.

Partial answer SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :holdsSeminar ?seminar .
}
```

This query retrieves the hospitals that hold seminars, but it does not provide the specific location of the seminar within the hospital or the city where the hospital is located.
