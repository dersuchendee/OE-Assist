The competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about seminars and their locations, specifically through the `ns1:takesPlaceAt` property, which associates a seminar with the hospital where it takes place.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?hospital ?hospitalLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a ns1:Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
  ?seminar ns1:takesPlaceAt ?hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
}
```
