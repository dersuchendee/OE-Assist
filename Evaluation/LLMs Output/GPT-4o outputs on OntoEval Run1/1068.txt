The competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate seminars to their locations, such as `:Seminar`, `:Location`, and `:takesPlaceAt`. Therefore, we can construct a SPARQL query to extract the location of a seminar.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?location
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :takesPlaceAt ?location .
}
```
