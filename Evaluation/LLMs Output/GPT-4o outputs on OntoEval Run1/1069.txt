**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a seminar. While there are classes and properties related to seminars and locations, there is no explicit connection between a seminar and its location in the ontology. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying seminars and their occurrences, but the specific location information is missing.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarOccurrence
WHERE {
  ?seminarOccurrence a :Cl_SeminarOccurrence .
  ?seminarOccurrence :relatesToSeminar ?seminar .
}
```
