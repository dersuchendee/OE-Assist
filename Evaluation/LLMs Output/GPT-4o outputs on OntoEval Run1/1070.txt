**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a seminar. While it includes classes and properties related to events, seminars, and places, there is no explicit connection between a seminar and its location. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?eventDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :eventDate ?eventDate .
}
```
