**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a seminar. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars, articles, and hospitals, but it lacks a direct connection between seminars and their locations. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar :hasLocation ?hospital . }
}
```
