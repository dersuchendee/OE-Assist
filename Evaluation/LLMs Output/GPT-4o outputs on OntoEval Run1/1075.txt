The competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to determine the location of a seminar. Specifically, the `:heldAt` property connects a `:Cl_Seminar` to a `:Cl_Location`, which can be queried to find the location of a seminar.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?location ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :heldAt ?location .
  ?location :cityName ?cityName .
}
```

This query retrieves the seminar, its location, and the name of the city where the seminar was held.
