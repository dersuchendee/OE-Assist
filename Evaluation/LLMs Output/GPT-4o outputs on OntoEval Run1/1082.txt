The competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Seminar` and the object property `seminarTookPlaceAt` which links a seminar to a location (`Cl_Location`). Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?location
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarTookPlaceAt ?location .
}
```
