The competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Seminar` and the object property `heldAt` which links a seminar to a hospital (`Cl_Hospital`). Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the location of a seminar.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :heldAt ?hospital .
}
```
