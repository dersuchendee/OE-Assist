**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a seminar. While there is a property `:seminarLocatedIn` that connects a seminar to a hospital, there is no direct connection to a specific location or city where the seminar took place. The ontology lacks a direct representation of the seminar's geographic location.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarLocatedIn ?hospital .
}
```
