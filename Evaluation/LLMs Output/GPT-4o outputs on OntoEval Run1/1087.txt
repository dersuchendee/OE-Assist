**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to verify if at least one article is always presented at each seminar. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars and articles, but it does not specify constraints or rules to ensure that every seminar has at least one article presented. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only provide partial information about the articles presented at seminars.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?seminar :presentsArticle ?article .
  }
}
```
