**Yes**

The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Seminar` class that ensures each seminar has at least one article presented. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to verify this condition.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasArticle ?article .
}
```
