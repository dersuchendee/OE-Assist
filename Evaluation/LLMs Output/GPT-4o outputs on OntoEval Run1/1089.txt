**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to ensure that at least one article is always presented at each seminar. However, we can extract partial information about seminars and articles presented.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?seminar :presentsArticle ?article .
  }
}
```
