**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a festival. The `tookPlaceIn` property connects a `Cl_TheatreFestival` to a `Cl_City`, but there is no direct connection to a specific festival occurrence or event. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :tookPlaceIn ?city .
}
```
