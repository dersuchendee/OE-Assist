**Yes**

The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Seminar` and the object property `:presents`, which relates a seminar to an article it presents. The ontology also includes a restriction on the `:Seminar` class that ensures each seminar presents at least one article (`owl:minCardinality "1"` on the `:presents` property). Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to verify that each seminar has at least one article presented.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :presents ?article .
}
```
