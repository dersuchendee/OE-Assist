The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `:Seminar` with a restriction that ensures each seminar has at least one article presented (`owl:minQualifiedCardinality "1"` on the property `:hasPresentedArticle`). This aligns with the competency question, which asks if at least one article is presented at each seminar.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that each seminar has at least one article presented:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentedArticle ?article .
}
```

This query retrieves all seminars and their associated articles, confirming that each seminar has at least one article presented.
