The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate seminars to seminar presentations and articles. We can write a SPARQL query to check if there is at least one article presented at each seminar.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentation ?presentation .
  ?presentation :presentationOfArticle ?article .
}
GROUP BY ?seminar
HAVING (COUNT(?article) > 0)
```

This query retrieves seminars that have at least one article presented, ensuring that each seminar has at least one associated article presentation.
