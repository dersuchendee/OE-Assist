**Yes**

The competency question "Which is the physical realization of an instrument?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the `hasPhysicalRealization` object property that associates a musical instrument with its physical embodiment, which directly answers the CQ.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?instrument ?instrumentLabel ?physicalRealization ?physicalRealizationLabel
WHERE {
  ?instrument a :MusicalInstrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }

  ?instrument :hasPhysicalRealization ?physicalRealization .
  OPTIONAL { ?physicalRealization rdfs:label ?physicalRealizationLabel . }
}
```
