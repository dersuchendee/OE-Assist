The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Seminar` with a restriction that ensures each seminar is associated with at least one article through the `presentedIn` property. This aligns with the competency question's requirement that at least one article is presented at each seminar.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract seminars and their associated articles:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate . }
  ?article :presentedIn ?seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle . }
}
```
