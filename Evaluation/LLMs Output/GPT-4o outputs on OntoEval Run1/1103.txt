The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Seminar` with a restriction that ensures at least one article is presented in each seminar. This is represented by the `owl:Restriction` on the `:presentedIn` property with `owl:minCardinality 1`.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that each seminar has at least one article presented:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_SeminarArticle .
  ?article :presentedIn ?seminar .
}
```

This query retrieves all seminars and their associated articles, ensuring that each seminar has at least one article presented.
