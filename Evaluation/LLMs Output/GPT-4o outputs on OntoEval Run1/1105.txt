**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine if at least one article is always presented at each seminar. However, we can extract information about seminars and the articles presented in them.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?article :presentedInSeminar ?seminar .
}
```
