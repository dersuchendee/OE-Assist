**Yes**

The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Seminar` with a restriction that ensures at least one article is presented at each seminar through the `hasPresentedArticle` property. This can be verified using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentedArticle ?article .
}
```

This query retrieves all seminars that have at least one article presented, which aligns with the competency question.
