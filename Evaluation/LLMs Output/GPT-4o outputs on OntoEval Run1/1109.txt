The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Cl_Seminar` class that ensures each seminar has at least one article presented in it. This is represented by the `owl:someValuesFrom` restriction on the `:presentedIn` property, which requires that each instance of `Cl_Seminar` is associated with at least one instance of `Cl_Article`.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract seminars and their presented articles:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?article :presentedIn ?seminar .
}
```
