**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the specific location where a festival took place. It includes classes and properties related to festivals, events, dates, and locations, but it does not explicitly connect a festival to a specific location instance. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the available festival and location information, but it will not directly answer the competency question.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?location ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :festivalName ?festivalName .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?festival :hasLocation ?location .
    ?location :locationName ?locationName .
  }
}
```
