The competency question "Who is where in this indoor location?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate a person to a location and an activity, which allows us to determine who is in a specific location.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?location
WHERE {
  ?activity rdf:type :Cl_PersonLocationActivity .
  ?activity :op_hasPerson ?person .
  ?activity :op_hasActivityLocation ?location .
}
```
