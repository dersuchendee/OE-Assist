**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the current "abstract time" for a particular user. The ontology defines abstract times and their start and end times, but it does not include any information about the current time or how to associate a user with the current abstract time.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?abstractTime ?startTime ?endTime
WHERE {
  ?abstractTime a :Cl_AbstractTime .
  ?abstractTime :dp_hasStartTime ?startTime .
  ?abstractTime :dp_hasEndTime ?endTime .
}
```
