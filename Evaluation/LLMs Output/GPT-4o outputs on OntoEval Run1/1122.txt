**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine where a user lives or where the system runs. The ontology includes a class for users and locations, but it does not specify any instances or provide a way to link a specific user to a specific location. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying users and their associated locations, but without specific instances, the exact location cannot be determined.

```sparql
SELECT ?user ?location
WHERE {
  ?user a :Cl_User .
  ?user :hasLocation ?location .
}
```
