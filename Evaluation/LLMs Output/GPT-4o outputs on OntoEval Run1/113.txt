**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the specific location where a festival took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, occurrences, locations, and plays, but it does not explicitly connect a festival to a specific city or location where it took place. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the available location information related to festivals.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasLocation ?location .
  ?location :locationName ?locationName .
}
```
