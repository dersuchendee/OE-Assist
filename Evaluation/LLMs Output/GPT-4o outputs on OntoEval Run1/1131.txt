**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as it is possible to extract the required information using a SPARQL query. The ontology provides classes and properties that allow us to retrieve the attribute values for the weather service, including the preferred service, location, and time period.

```sparql
SELECT ?service ?location ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?userPref rdf:type :UserPreference .
  ?userPref :preferredService ?service .
  ?userPref :preferredLocation ?location .
  ?userPref :preferredTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
```
