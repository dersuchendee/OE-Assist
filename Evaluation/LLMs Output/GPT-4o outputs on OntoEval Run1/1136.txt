**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate specific devices with their functionalities in terms of displaying content. The ontology includes classes and properties for devices, content, and user locations, but it lacks a direct connection between a device and its specific functionality for displaying content. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?device ?content
WHERE {
  ?device a :Cl_Device .
  ?device :displaysContent ?content .
}
```
