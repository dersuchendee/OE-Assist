**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a user with their preferred movie categories. The ontology includes a class `Cl_UserPreference` that connects users to movie categories and weather conditions, but there is no direct link from `Cl_User` to `Cl_MovieCategory` through `Cl_UserPreference` in the provided ontology. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?user ?categoryName
WHERE {
  ?user a :Cl_User .
  ?user :hasPreference ?preference .
  ?preference :prefersMovieCategory ?category .
  ?category :hasCategoryName ?categoryName .
}
```
