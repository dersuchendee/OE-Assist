The competency question "What are the preferred movie categories of the current user?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `hasPreference` property that links a `User` to a `MovieCategory`, and the individual `CurrentUser` has a preference for `ActionMovie`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract this information.

```sparql
SELECT ?movieCategory ?categoryLabel
WHERE {
  :CurrentUser :hasPreference ?movieCategory .
  OPTIONAL { ?movieCategory rdfs:label ?categoryLabel . }
}
```
