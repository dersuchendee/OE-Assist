The competency question "What are the free time periods in the userâ€™s calendar today?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that represent events and free time periods within a calendar, and there are example instances that demonstrate how these are used.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the free time periods from the user's calendar:

```sparql
SELECT ?freeTimePeriod ?startTime ?endTime
WHERE {
  :MyCalendar :hasFreeTimePeriod ?freeTimePeriod .
  ?freeTimePeriod a :FreeTimePeriod .
  ?freeTimePeriod :startTime ?startTime .
  ?freeTimePeriod :endTime ?endTime .
}
ORDER BY ?startTime
```
