**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about the location of a festival. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, and locations, but there is no direct connection between a specific festival and its location. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying festivals and their associated locations, if any.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?festival :locatedIn ?location .
    ?location :locationCity ?cityName .
  }
}
```
