**No**

The ontology does not provide direct attributes for the event category "Movie" such as genre and actors. The ontology does have properties like `hasGenre` and `hasActor`, but they are not connected to the class `Cl_MovieScreening`, which is the reification class that could potentially link these attributes to a specific event. Therefore, the CQ cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?movie ?title
WHERE {
  ?movie a :Cl_Movie .
  ?movie :hasTitle ?title .
}
```
