**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for a set of actors associated with a film event, as there are no instances of actors or a direct connection between a film event and a set of actors. However, we can extract partial information about the film event's title, genre, and location.

```sparql
SELECT ?filmEvent ?title ?genre ?location
WHERE {
  ?filmEvent a :FilmEvent .
  OPTIONAL { ?filmEvent :hasTitle ?title . }
  OPTIONAL { ?filmEvent :hasGenre ?genre . }
  OPTIONAL { ?filmEvent :hasLocation ?location . }
}
```
