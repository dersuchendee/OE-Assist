The competency question "What is the quality of a flow at a specific time?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to connect a flow to its quality observation and the time of observation. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?flow ?quality ?time
WHERE {
  ?flow a :Flow .
  ?flow :hasQualityObservation ?observation .

  ?observation :hasQuality ?quality .
  ?observation :observedAtTime ?time .
}
```
