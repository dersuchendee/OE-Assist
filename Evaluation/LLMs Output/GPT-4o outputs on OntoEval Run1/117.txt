**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a festival. The `hasLocation` property is associated with `Cl_TheatreFestival`, but there is no connection to a specific city or theatre where the festival took place. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasLocation ?location .
}
```
