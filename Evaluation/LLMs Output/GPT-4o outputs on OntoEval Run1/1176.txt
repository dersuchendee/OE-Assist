**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to measure or evaluate the efficiency of a process. While there is a property `:hasEfficiency` associated with the `:Process` class, the ontology does not define how this efficiency is calculated or what factors contribute to it. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract processes and their efficiency values:

```sparql
SELECT ?process ?efficiency
WHERE {
  ?process a :Process .
  ?process :hasEfficiency ?efficiency .
}
```
