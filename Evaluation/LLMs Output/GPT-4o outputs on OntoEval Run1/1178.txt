The competency question "What kind of execution techniques are possible to perform according to a specific mounting system?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology defines a relationship between `MountingSystem` and `ExecutionTechnique` through the property `hasPossibleExecutionTechnique`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the possible execution techniques for each mounting system.

```sparql
SELECT ?mountingSystem ?executionTechnique
WHERE {
  ?mountingSystem a :MountingSystem .
  ?mountingSystem :hasPossibleExecutionTechnique ?executionTechnique .
}
```
