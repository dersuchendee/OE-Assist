**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine if the sound in a place is performed by hand or by electric means. The ontology defines classes for manual and electric performance, but it does not specify how to associate a specific sound with either manual or electric performance. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the means of performance associated with sounds in places.

```sparql
SELECT ?place ?means
WHERE {
  ?place a :Place .
  ?place :hasSound ?sound .
  ?sound :hasMeans ?means .
}
```
