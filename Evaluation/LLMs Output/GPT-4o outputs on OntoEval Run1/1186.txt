The competency question "Where did she live?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a `Person` class with a property `hasLivedIn` that relates a person to a `Place`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the places where a person has lived.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?place
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :hasLivedIn ?place .
}
```
