**Yes**

The competency question "In what context the meeting happened?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Meeting` with a property `hasContext` that links to the class `Context`. This allows us to query for the context of each meeting.

```sparql
SELECT ?meeting ?context
WHERE {
  ?meeting a :Meeting .
  ?meeting :hasContext ?context .
}
```
