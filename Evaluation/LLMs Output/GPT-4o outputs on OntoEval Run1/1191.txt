**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine if an event is religious or secular based on the information provided. The classes `ReligiousEvent` and `SecularEvent` are defined, but there is no property or data in the ontology that allows us to determine the type of an event. We can only extract events without specifying their type.

```sparql
SELECT ?event
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
}
```
