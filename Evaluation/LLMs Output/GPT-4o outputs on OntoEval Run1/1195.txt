**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine if a person was invited to a meeting or if the meeting was accidental. The ontology includes properties like `:isInvitedTo` and `:isAccidental`, but it does not provide a mechanism to directly query if a specific meeting was accidental or if a person was invited to it. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?event ?isAccidental
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :participatesIn ?event .
  ?event a :Meeting .
  OPTIONAL { ?event :isAccidental ?isAccidental . }
}
```
