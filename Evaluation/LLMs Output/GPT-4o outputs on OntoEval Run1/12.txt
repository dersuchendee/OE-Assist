The competency question "Which are the parts of an instrument?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_MusicalInstrument` and the object property `hasPart` which relates a musical instrument to its parts (`Cl_InstrumentPart`). Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the parts of each instrument.

```sparql
SELECT ?instrument ?part
WHERE {
  ?instrument a :Cl_MusicalInstrument .
  ?instrument :hasPart ?part .
}
```
