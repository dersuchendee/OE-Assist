**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to extract the composer's network, including patrons and institutions, as a single query. However, we can extract partial information about the composer's patrons and institutions separately.

```sparql
SELECT ?composer ?patron ?institution
WHERE {
  ?composer a :Composer .
  OPTIONAL { ?composer :hasPatron ?patron . }
  OPTIONAL { ?composer :worksForInstitution ?institution . }
}
```
