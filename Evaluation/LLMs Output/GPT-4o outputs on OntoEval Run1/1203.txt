**Yes**

The competency question "What was the disposition of the organ at a specific point in time?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to query the disposition of an organ at a specific time.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?disposition ?time
WHERE {
  ?organ a :Organ .
  ?organ :hasDispositionAtTime ?dispositionAtTime .
  ?dispositionAtTime :hasDisposition ?disposition .
  ?dispositionAtTime :atTime ?time .
  FILTER(?time = "SPECIFIC_DATE_TIME"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
```

Replace "SPECIFIC_DATE_TIME" with the desired date and time to get the disposition of the organ at that specific point in time.
