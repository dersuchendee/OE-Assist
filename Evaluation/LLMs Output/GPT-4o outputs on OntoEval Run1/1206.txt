The competency question "Where is an organ located originally?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Organ` and the object property `hasOriginalLocation`, which connects an organ to its original location, which is a `Place`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract this information.

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?originalLocation
WHERE {
  ?organ a :Organ .
  ?organ :hasOriginalLocation ?originalLocation .
}
```
