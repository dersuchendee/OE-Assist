The competency question "When is an organ moved to another location?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to track the movement of an organ, including the time of the movement event.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?movementEvent ?fromLocation ?toLocation ?time
WHERE {
  ?organ a :Organ .
  ?organ :hasMovementEvent ?movementEvent .

  ?movementEvent :fromLocation ?fromLocation .
  ?movementEvent :toLocation ?toLocation .
  ?movementEvent :atTime ?time .
}
ORDER BY ?time
```
