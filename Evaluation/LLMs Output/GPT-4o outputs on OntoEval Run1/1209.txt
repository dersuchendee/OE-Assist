The competency question "What are all compositions in tune family X?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology defines a `Composition` class and a `TuneFamily` class, with a property `hasTuneFamily` that connects compositions to tune families. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve all compositions that belong to a specific tune family.

```sparql
SELECT ?composition ?compositionLabel
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition .
  ?composition :hasTuneFamily :X .
  OPTIONAL { ?composition rdfs:label ?compositionLabel . }
}
```

In this query, replace `:X` with the specific tune family URI you are interested in. The query retrieves all compositions that are associated with the specified tune family.
