The competency question "What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate theatre festivals to theatre productions and plays. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festivalName ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival rdf:type :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasName ?festivalName .
  ?festival :hasProduction ?production .
  ?production :featuresPlay ?play .
  ?play :hasName ?playName .
}
```

This query retrieves the names of plays that are featured in theatre festivals by connecting the `Cl_TheatreFestival` class to the `Cl_Play` class through the `hasProduction` and `featuresPlay` properties.
