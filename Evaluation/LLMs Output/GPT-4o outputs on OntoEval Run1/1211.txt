**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves finding related tune families based on a similarity measure, which is represented in the ontology through the `SimilarityRelation` class and its associated properties. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?relatedTuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?similarityRelation a :SimilarityRelation .
  ?similarityRelation :hasSourceTuneFamily :TuneFamilyX .
  ?similarityRelation :hasTargetTuneFamily ?relatedTuneFamily .
  ?similarityRelation :hasSimilarityMeasure :SimilarityMeasureY .
}
```
