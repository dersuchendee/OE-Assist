**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as it includes classes and properties that allow us to identify rare species and their characteristics within a specific aquifer. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?species ?characteristic
WHERE {
  ?species a :RareSpecies .
  ?species :isFoundIn ?aquifer .
  ?aquifer a :Aquifer .
  ?species :hasCharacteristic ?characteristic .
}
```
