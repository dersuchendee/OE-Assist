The competency question is supported by the ontology as it includes annotation properties specifically related to documenting rare species. The SPARQL query to extract the specific annotation properties used to document rare species is as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?annotationProperty ?label
WHERE {
  ?annotationProperty a owl:AnnotationProperty .
  ?annotationProperty :appliesToClass :RareSpecies .
  OPTIONAL { ?annotationProperty rdfs:label ?label . }
}
```
