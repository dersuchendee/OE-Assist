The competency question "What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides information about theatre festivals, theatre productions, and plays. We can use a SPARQL query to extract the plays associated with a specific theatre festival.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a theatre:TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }

  ?festival theatre:hasProduction ?production .
  ?production theatre:hasPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?play
```

This query retrieves the plays associated with each theatre festival by following the property chain from `TheatreFestival` to `TheatreProduction` to `Play`.
