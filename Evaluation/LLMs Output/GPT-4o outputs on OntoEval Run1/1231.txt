The competency question is supported by the ontology as it includes classes and properties that relate to microbial communities, CO2 fixation processes, and groundwater ecosystems. The ontology defines a `KeyMicrobialCommunity` class that is involved in a `CO2FixationProcess` occurring in a `GroundwaterEcosystem`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the key microbial communities involved in CO2 fixation in groundwater ecosystems.

```sparql
SELECT ?microbialCommunity ?mcLabel
WHERE {
  ?microbialCommunity a :KeyMicrobialCommunity .
  OPTIONAL { ?microbialCommunity rdfs:label ?mcLabel . }
}
```
