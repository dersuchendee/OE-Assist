**No**

The ontology does not provide specific instances or types of "Form of Carbon Fixation" that occur in forest soils. It only defines the class hierarchy and relationships. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only extract the class structure, not specific forms.

```sparql
SELECT ?formOfCarbonFixation
WHERE {
  ?formOfCarbonFixation a :FormOfCarbonFixation .
}
```
