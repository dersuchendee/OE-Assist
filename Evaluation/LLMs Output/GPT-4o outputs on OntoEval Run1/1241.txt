The competency question "How does nitrogen leaching vary across different soil types in forest ecosystems?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides classes and properties to represent nitrogen leaching observations, soil types, and forest ecosystems. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the relevant information:

```sparql
SELECT ?soilType ?leachingRate
WHERE {
  ?observation a :NitrogenLeachingObservation .
  ?observation :hasSoilType ?soilType .
  ?observation :hasNitrogenLeachingRate ?leachingRate .
  ?observation :occursIn ?ecosystem .
  ?ecosystem a :ForestEcosystem .
}
ORDER BY ?soilType
```
