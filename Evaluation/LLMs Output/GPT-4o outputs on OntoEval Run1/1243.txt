**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the registration date of hospitalisation rates related to a disease, which is directly represented in the ontology through the `HospitalisationRateObservation` class and its properties.

```sparql
SELECT ?observation ?disease ?registrationDate
WHERE {
  ?observation a :HospitalisationRateObservation .
  ?observation :isRelatedToDisease ?disease .
  ?observation :hasRegistrationDate ?registrationDate .
}
```
