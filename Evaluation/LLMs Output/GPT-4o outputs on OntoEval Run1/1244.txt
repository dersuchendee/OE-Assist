**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as it involves querying for contaminated sites in a geographical area recorded over time, which can be extracted using the classes and properties defined in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?contaminatedSite ?area ?observationTime
WHERE {
  ?contaminatedSite a :ContaminatedSite .
  ?contaminatedSite :hasObservation ?observation .

  ?observation :observedInArea ?area .
  ?observation :hasObservationTime ?observationTime .
}
```
