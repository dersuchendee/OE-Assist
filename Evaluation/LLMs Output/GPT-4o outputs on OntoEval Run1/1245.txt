The competency question is supported by the ontology. We can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?agent ?observation ?time ?amount
WHERE {
  ?agent a :Agent .
  ?agent :records ?observation .

  ?observation a :MicrobiologicalSubstanceAmountObservation .
  ?observation :atTime ?time .
  ?observation :hasAmount ?amount .
}
```
