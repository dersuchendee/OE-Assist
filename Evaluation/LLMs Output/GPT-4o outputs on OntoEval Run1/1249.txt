**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it includes classes and properties that relate hospitals to observations of average length of stay for specific disease categories. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel (AVG(?lengthOfStay) AS ?averageLengthOfStay)
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }

  ?hospital :hasObservation ?observation .
  ?observation a :AverageLengthOfStayObservation .

  ?observation :isObservationOfDiseaseCategory ?diseaseCategory .
  ?observation :hasAverageLengthOfStay ?lengthOfStay .
}
GROUP BY ?hospital ?hospitalLabel
ORDER BY DESC(?averageLengthOfStay)
LIMIT 1
```
