**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the units of measure for chemical measurements in water. The ontology defines a class `UnitOfMeasure` and a property `hasUnitOfMeasure`, but there is no instance data or further specification of what these units are. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only extract partial information about the existence of units of measure, but not their specific details.

```sparql
SELECT ?chemicalMeasurement ?unitOfMeasure
WHERE {
  ?chemicalMeasurement a :ChemicalMeasurement .
  OPTIONAL { ?chemicalMeasurement :hasUnitOfMeasure ?unitOfMeasure . }
}
```
