The competency question "What is the energy components in this system, e.g. exergy and energy?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines a `System` class that has a property `hasEnergyComponent` which relates to the `EnergyComponent` class. The `EnergyComponent` class has subclasses `Exergy` and `Anergy`, which are specific types of energy components. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the energy components of a system.

```sparql
SELECT ?system ?energyComponent
WHERE {
  ?system a :System .
  ?system :hasEnergyComponent ?energyComponent .
}
```
