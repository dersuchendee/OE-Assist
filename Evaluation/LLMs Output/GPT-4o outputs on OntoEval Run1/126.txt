**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct connection between theatre festivals and the plays that are part of them. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, productions, and plays, but it lacks a direct way to query which plays are part of a specific theatre festival. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on theatre festivals and productions:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?production
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasFestivalProduction ?production .
}
```

This query retrieves festivals and their associated productions, but it does not directly link to the specific plays within those productions.
