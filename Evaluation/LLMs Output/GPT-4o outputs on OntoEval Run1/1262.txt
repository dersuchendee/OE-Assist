**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model the concept of "rebound effects" or "added energy requirements" in relation to a "material flow." While there are classes for `ReboundEffect` and `EnergyRequirement`, they are associated with `Process` rather than `Flow`. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?process ?energyRequirement ?reboundEffect
WHERE {
  ?process a :Process .
  OPTIONAL { ?process :hasEnergyRequirement ?energyRequirement . }
  OPTIONAL { ?process :hasReboundEffect ?reboundEffect . }
}
```
