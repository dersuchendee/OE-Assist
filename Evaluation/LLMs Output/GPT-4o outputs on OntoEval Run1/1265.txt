**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the legal conditions and legislation affecting a specific actor, object, or process. The ontology defines classes and properties related to legal conditions and legislation, but it does not establish a direct connection between specific actors, objects, or processes and the legal conditions or legislation that affect them.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?legalCondition ?legislation
WHERE {
  ?legalCondition a :LegalCondition .
  ?legalCondition :governedBy ?legislation .
}
```
