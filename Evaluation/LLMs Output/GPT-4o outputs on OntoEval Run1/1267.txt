The competency question "Was the (material, information) exchange successful?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for `MaterialExchange` and `InformationExchange`, both of which are subclasses of `Exchange`. Each `Exchange` has an associated `ExchangeEvaluation`, which includes a boolean property `isSuccessful` to indicate the success of the exchange. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract this information.

```sparql
SELECT ?exchange ?isSuccessful
WHERE {
  ?exchange a :Exchange .
  ?exchange :hasEvaluation ?evaluation .
  ?evaluation :isSuccessful ?isSuccessful .
}
```
