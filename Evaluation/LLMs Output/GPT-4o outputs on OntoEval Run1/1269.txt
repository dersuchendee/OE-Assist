The competency question "What are the potential rebound effects of this action/process?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow for the evaluation of actions and the measurement of rebound effects.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the potential rebound effects of actions:

```sparql
SELECT ?action ?evaluation ?reboundEffect
WHERE {
  ?action a :Action .
  ?action :hasEvaluation ?evaluation .
  ?evaluation :measuresReboundEffect ?reboundEffect .
}
```
