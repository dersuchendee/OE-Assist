**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct connection between a theatre festival and the plays that can be seen during it. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and other related entities, but it lacks a specific property that directly links a theatre festival to the plays being shown. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only provide a partial answer by listing plays without associating them with specific festivals.

```sparql
SELECT ?play
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
}
```
