**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine if the sound in a place is performed by hand or by electric means. The ontology includes a `SoundPractice` class and a `SoundMethod` class, but it does not specify the types of sound methods (e.g., manual or electric) that can be used. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?bellTower ?soundMethod
WHERE {
  ?bellTower a :BellTower .
  ?bellTower :currentSoundPractice ?soundPractice .
  ?soundPractice :hasMethod ?soundMethod .
}
```
