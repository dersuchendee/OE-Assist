**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for recordings involving a bell or set of bells. However, we can extract partial information about recordings and the bells involved.

```sparql
SELECT ?recording ?bell
WHERE {
  ?recording a :Recording .
  ?recording :involvesBell ?bell .
}
```
