**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine if an event was a celebration, festival, or private event. The ontology defines these as subclasses of `EventType`, but there is no direct link between an `Event` and its specific type (Celebration, Festival, or PrivateEvent) in the provided ontology. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for events and their types, but it won't specify if they are celebrations, festivals, or private events.

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?eventType
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  ?event :hasEventType ?eventType .
}
```
