**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate places with events in which musicians played. The ontology only specifies that events have locations and participants, but it does not specify the type of event or the role of the musician in the event. Therefore, we can only extract partial information about events and their locations.

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?location
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  ?event :hasLocation ?location .
}
```
