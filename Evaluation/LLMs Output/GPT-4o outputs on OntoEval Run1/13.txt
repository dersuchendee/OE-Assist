The competency question "Which are the parts of an instrument?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines a class `MusicalInstrument` and a class `InstrumentPart`, with a relationship `hasPart` that connects a musical instrument to its parts. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the parts of each musical instrument.

```sparql
SELECT ?instrument ?instrumentLabel ?part ?partLabel
WHERE {
  ?instrument a :MusicalInstrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }

  ?instrument :hasPart ?part .
  OPTIONAL { ?part rdfs:label ?partLabel . }
}
```
