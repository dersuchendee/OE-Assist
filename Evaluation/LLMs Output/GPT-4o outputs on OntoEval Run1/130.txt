**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about the plays that can be seen during a certain theatre festival. The ontology includes classes and properties related to festivals, cities, plays, and their appearances, but it does not explicitly link plays to specific festivals in a way that can be queried directly.

However, we can extract partial information about the plays that are associated with a festival occurrence, but not specifically during a certain theatre festival.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?play ?title
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_Festival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :hasPlayAppearance ?appearance .
  ?appearance :isPlayOf ?play .
  ?play :hasTitle ?title .
}
```
