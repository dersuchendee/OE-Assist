The competency question "What are all compositions in tune family X?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the classes `Composition` and `TuneFamily`, and the object property `memberOf` which connects compositions to tune families. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the compositions that belong to a specific tune family.

```sparql
SELECT ?composition
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition .
  ?composition :memberOf :TuneFamilyX .
}
```

In this query, replace `:TuneFamilyX` with the specific tune family you are interested in. This query will return all compositions that are members of the specified tune family.
