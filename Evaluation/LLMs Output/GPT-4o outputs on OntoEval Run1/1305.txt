**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to compare or analyze similarities/differences between compositions within a tune family based on a specific measure. The ontology defines classes and properties for compositions, tune families, measures, and measure types, but it lacks the necessary structure or properties to perform comparative analysis directly.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by listing compositions and their measures within a specific tune family:

```sparql
SELECT ?composition ?measure ?measureType ?measureValue
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition .
  ?composition :belongsToTuneFamily :TuneFamilyX .
  ?composition :hasMeasure ?measure .
  ?measure :measureType ?measureType .
  ?measure :measureValue ?measureValue .
}
```
