**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the primary CO2 fixation pathways specifically in beech forests. The ontology defines a class `BeechForest` as a subclass of `ForestEcosystem`, which has a restriction on the property `hasPrimaryCO2FixationPathway`. However, there is no direct instance data or further specification that allows us to extract specific pathways for beech forests.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?pathway
WHERE {
  ?forest a :BeechForest .
  ?forest :hasPrimaryCO2FixationPathway ?pathway .
}
```
