The competency question is supported by the ontology as it is possible to write a SPARQL query to extract the chemical parameters associated with specific aquifer fungi. The ontology includes classes and properties that connect aquifer fungi to chemical parameters.

```sparql
SELECT ?fungus ?chemicalParameter
WHERE {
  ?fungus a :AquiferFungus .
  ?fungus :hasAssociatedChemicalParameter ?chemicalParameter .
}
```
