**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it includes subclasses of the major classes "Aquatic Microbe" and "Aquatic Fungi". Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?majorClass ?subclass ?subclassLabel
WHERE {
  VALUES ?majorClass { :AquaticMicrobe :AquaticFungi }
  ?subclass rdfs:subClassOf ?majorClass .
  OPTIONAL { ?subclass rdfs:label ?subclassLabel . }
}
```
