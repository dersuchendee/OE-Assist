The competency question is supported by the ontology as it includes classes and properties that relate aquifer ecosystems to microbial functional guilds. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?aquiferEcosystem ?guild
WHERE {
  ?aquiferEcosystem a :AquiferEcosystem .
  ?aquiferEcosystem :hasFunctionalGuild ?guild .
}
```
