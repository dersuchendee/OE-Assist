**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the trophic relationships between different species of aquifer microbes, which are represented in the ontology through the `TrophicRelationship` class and its properties `hasConsumer`, `hasResource`, and `occursIn`. The ontology also includes the `AquiferMicrobeHabitat` class, which is a subclass of `Habitat`, allowing us to specifically query for relationships occurring in aquifer microbe habitats.

```sparql
SELECT ?consumer ?resource ?habitat
WHERE {
  ?relationship a :TrophicRelationship .
  ?relationship :hasConsumer ?consumer .
  ?relationship :hasResource ?resource .
  ?relationship :occursIn ?habitat .
  ?habitat a :AquiferMicrobeHabitat .
}
```
