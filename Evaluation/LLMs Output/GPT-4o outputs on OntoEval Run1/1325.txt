**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the relationships between energy metabolism, CO2 fixation pathways, and aquatic ecosystems, which are all represented in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?energyMetabolism ?co2FixationPathway ?aquaticEcosystem
WHERE {
  ?energyMetabolism a :EnergyMetabolism .
  ?energyMetabolism :contributesTo ?co2FixationPathway .
  ?energyMetabolism :occursIn ?aquaticEcosystem .
  ?co2FixationPathway a :CO2FixationPathway .
  ?co2FixationPathway :occursIn ?aquaticEcosystem .
}
