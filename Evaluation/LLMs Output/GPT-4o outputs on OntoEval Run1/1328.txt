**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves the relationship between beech forests, carbon sequestration, and carbon cycling, which are all represented in the ontology. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?beechForest ?carbonSequestration ?carbonCycling
WHERE {
  ?beechForest a :BeechForest .
  ?beechForest :participatesIn ?carbonSequestration .
  ?carbonSequestration :contributesTo ?carbonCycling .
}
```
