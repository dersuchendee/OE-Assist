**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as the ontology includes classes and properties that relate dissolved carbon in water to carbon cycling in karst systems. The relationship is explicitly modeled through the `participatesIn` property.

```sparql
SELECT ?dissolvedCarbon ?carbonCycling
WHERE {
  ?dissolvedCarbon a :DissolvedCarbonInWater .
  ?dissolvedCarbon :participatesIn ?carbonCycling .
  ?carbonCycling a :CarbonCyclingInKarstSystems .
}
```
