**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it includes classes and properties related to the nitrogen cycle processes in beech forest ecosystems. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?process ?processLabel
WHERE {
  ?ecosystem a :BeechForestEcosystem .
  ?ecosystem :hasMajorProcess ?process .
  OPTIONAL { ?process rdfs:label ?processLabel . }
}
```
