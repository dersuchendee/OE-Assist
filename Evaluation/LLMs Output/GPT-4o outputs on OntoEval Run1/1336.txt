The competency question "How does nitrogen leaching vary across different soil types in forest ecosystems?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides classes and properties that relate nitrogen leaching to soil types and forest ecosystems, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to extract the necessary information.

```sparql
SELECT ?soilType ?leachingRate
WHERE {
  ?leaching a :NitrogenLeaching .
  ?leaching :hasSoilType ?soilType .
  ?leaching :hasLeachingRate ?leachingRate .
}
ORDER BY ?soilType
```
