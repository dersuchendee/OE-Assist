**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying for contaminated sites within a geographical area and their recorded times, which are represented in the ontology. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?contaminatedSite ?geographicalArea ?observation ?recordedTime
WHERE {
  ?contaminatedSite a :ContaminatedSite .
  ?contaminatedSite :locatedIn ?geographicalArea .
  ?contaminatedSite :hasObservation ?observation .
  ?observation :hasRecordedTime ?recordedTime .
}
```
