**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between parameters and the quality of water bodies. The ontology defines a class `WaterQualityParameter` that represents the quality of a `WaterBody`, but it does not specify any specific parameters or instances that can be queried to represent the quality of water bodies.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?parameter
WHERE {
  ?parameter a :WaterQualityParameter .
}
```
