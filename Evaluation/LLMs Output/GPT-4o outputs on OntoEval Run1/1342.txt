**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as the ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to determine when the level of a chemical substance is recorded in a water body. The ontology includes the `ChemicalLevelRecording` class, which has properties for recording the date (`hasRecordingDate`), the chemical substance (`recordsChemical`), and the water body (`recordedIn`). 

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?recordingDate ?chemical ?waterBody
WHERE {
  ?recording a :ChemicalLevelRecording .
  ?recording :hasRecordingDate ?recordingDate .
  ?recording :recordsChemical ?chemical .
  ?recording :recordedIn ?waterBody .
}
```
