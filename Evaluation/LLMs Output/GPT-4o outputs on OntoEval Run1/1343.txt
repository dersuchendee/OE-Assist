**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to connect hospitals with the average number of admissions for a given diagnosis code. The ontology includes classes and properties related to hospitals, admissions, and diagnosis codes, but it lacks a direct property or class that represents the average number of admissions for a diagnosis code. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying hospitals and their associated diagnosis codes, but not the average admissions.

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?diagnosisCode
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Hospital .
  ?hospital :hasAdmissionSummary ?admissionSummary .
  ?admissionSummary :appliesToDiagnosisCode ?diagnosisCode .
}
```
