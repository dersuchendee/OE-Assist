**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to connect hospitalisation rates to specific diseases or to determine when these rates are registered. The ontology only defines a class for hospitalisation rate observations and a property to relate these observations to diseases, but it does not include any information about the registration of these rates.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?observation ?disease ?registrationDate
WHERE {
  ?observation a :HospitalisationRateObservation .
  OPTIONAL { ?observation :isRelatedToDisease ?disease . }
  OPTIONAL { ?observation :hasRegistrationDate ?registrationDate . }
}
```
