**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between chemical measurements and their units of measure. The ontology defines a `ChemicalMeasurement` class and a `UnitOfMeasure` class, but there is no instance data or further specification to extract the units of measure for chemical measurements in water. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?chemicalMeasurement ?unit
WHERE {
  ?chemicalMeasurement a :ChemicalMeasurement .
  ?chemicalMeasurement :hasUnit ?unit .
}
```
