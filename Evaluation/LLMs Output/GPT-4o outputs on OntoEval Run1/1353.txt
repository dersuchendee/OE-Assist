**No**

The ontology provided does not contain explicit information about the parts of an organ at a specific point in time. While the ontology includes classes and properties related to organs and their components, it lacks a direct representation of temporal aspects or historical states of organ parts. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the current ontology structure.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?part
WHERE {
  ?organ a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
  ?organ <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/includesPart> ?part .
}
```

This query retrieves the parts of each organ, but it does not address the temporal aspect specified in the competency question.
