**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any specific properties or classes that directly relate to the construction or renovation of an organ, nor does it have any properties that link an organ to a builder or renovator. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about organs and their related projects, which might indirectly involve construction or renovation activities.

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?project
WHERE {
  ?organ a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
  ?organ <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/isDescribedBy> ?project .
}
```
