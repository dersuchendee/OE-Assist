**No**

The ontology provided does not explicitly define a way to identify the original parts of an organ. The ontology includes classes and properties related to organs, their parts, and their relationships, but it does not specify which parts are original or have been modified. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the parts of an organ.

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?part
WHERE {
  ?organ a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
  ?organ <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/includesPart> ?part .
}
```
