**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to identify the original parts of an organ. The ontology includes classes and properties related to organs, their parts, and their descriptions, but it does not specify which parts are original or how to determine the originality of parts. A partial answer could be extracted by identifying the parts of an organ, but it would not indicate their originality.

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?part
WHERE {
  ?organ a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
  ?organ <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/includesPart> ?part .
}
```
