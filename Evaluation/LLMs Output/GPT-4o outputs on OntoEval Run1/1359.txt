**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any properties or classes that directly relate to the movement of an organ to another location. The ontology primarily describes the structure and components of organs, such as cases, consoles, and wind systems, but does not include any information about the movement or relocation of organs.

Partial answer SPARQL query:
```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?part
WHERE {
  ?organ a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
  ?organ <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/includesPart> ?part .
}
```
This query retrieves organs and their parts, but it does not address the movement of organs to another location.
