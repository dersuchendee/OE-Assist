**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about the plays that can be seen during a theatre festival. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, locations, plays, productions, and other related entities, but it does not explicitly connect plays to specific theatre festivals.

To extract a partial answer, we can query for the plays associated with theatre festivals, but this will not provide a complete answer to the competency question as it does not specify which plays can be seen during a certain theatre festival.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
```
