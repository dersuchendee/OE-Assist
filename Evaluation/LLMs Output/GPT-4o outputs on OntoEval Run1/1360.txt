**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes that directly relate to the "sources of the project" that an organ is involved in. The ontology includes classes and properties related to organs, their parts, and associated projects, but it does not specify any sources for these projects. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the projects associated with an organ:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?project
WHERE {
  ?organ a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
  ?organ <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/isDescribedBy> ?project .
}
```

This query retrieves the projects associated with each organ, but it does not provide information about the sources of these projects.
