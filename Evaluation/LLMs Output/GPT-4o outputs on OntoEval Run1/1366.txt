**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes that directly relate to recordings or sound practices involving bells or sets of bells. The ontology primarily focuses on the structural aspects of bells and bell towers, such as their components and classifications. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the bells and sets of bells, as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?bell ?setOfBells
WHERE {
  ?bell a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/Bell> .
  ?setOfBells a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/SetOfBells> .
  ?bell <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/isComponentOf> ?setOfBells .
}
```

This query retrieves the bells and the sets of bells they are part of, but it does not provide information about recordings or sound practices.
