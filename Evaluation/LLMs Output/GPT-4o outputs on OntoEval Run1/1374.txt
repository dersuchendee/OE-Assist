**No**

The ontology provided does not include any information about the foundry or the entity responsible for casting the bells. Therefore, the competency question "By whom (by which foundry) were they cast?" cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, we can extract partial information about the bells themselves.

```sparql
SELECT ?bell ?bellLabel
WHERE {
  ?bell a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/Bell> .
  OPTIONAL { ?bell rdfs:label ?bellLabel . }
}
```
