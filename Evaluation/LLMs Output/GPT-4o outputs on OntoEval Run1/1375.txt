**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a musician with the places they visited. The ontology focuses on meetups, participants, and locations, but it does not explicitly link a specific musician to the places they visited. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists the places associated with meetups:

```sparql
SELECT ?place ?placeLabel
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasPlace ?place .
  OPTIONAL { ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel . }
}
```
