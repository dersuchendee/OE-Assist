**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the specific location where a participant performed. The ontology includes classes and properties related to meetups, participants, and locations, but it does not specify a direct relationship between a participant and a specific performance location. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists the places associated with meetups:

```sparql
SELECT ?participant ?place
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasParticipant ?participant .
  ?meetup mtps:hasPlace ?place .
}
```
