**No**

The ontology does not provide specific classes or properties to directly determine if a meetup was a celebration, festival, or private event. The closest related concept is the `mtps:Purpose` class, which includes individuals like `mtps:PublicCelebration`, but it does not cover all the types mentioned in the CQ. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted based on the available purposes.

```sparql
SELECT ?meetup ?purpose
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasAPurpose ?purpose .
  FILTER(?purpose = mtps:PublicCelebration)
}
```
