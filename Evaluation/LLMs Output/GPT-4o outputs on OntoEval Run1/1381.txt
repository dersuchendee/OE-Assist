**No**

The ontology does not include any properties or classes related to financial transactions or support for events. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question "Who paid to support the event?" using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about the participants of the meetups, which might be indirectly related to the event support.

```sparql
SELECT ?meetup ?participant
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasParticipant ?participant .
}
```
