**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to identify if a composition has been identified as a variant in a tune family. The ontology includes classes for `Tune` and `TuneFamily`, but there is no explicit relationship or property that connects a composition to a tune family as a variant. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying tunes and their families, but not specifically if they are variants.

```sparql
SELECT ?tune ?tuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?tune a :Tune .
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
}
```
