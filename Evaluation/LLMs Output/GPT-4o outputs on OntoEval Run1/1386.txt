**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct relationship between a composition and a tune family. The ontology defines a `Tune` class and a `TuneFamily` class, but there is no property that links a `Tune` to a `TuneFamily`. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract tunes:

```sparql
SELECT ?tune
WHERE {
  ?tune a :Tune .
}
```
