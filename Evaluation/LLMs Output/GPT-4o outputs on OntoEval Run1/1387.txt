The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to compositions or assignments of compositions to tune families. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to tunes and tune families.

```sparql
SELECT ?tune ?tuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?tune a :Tune .
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
}
```
