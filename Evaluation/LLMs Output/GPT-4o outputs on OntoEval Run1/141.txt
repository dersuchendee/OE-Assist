**Yes**

The competency question "What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for plays associated with theatre festivals.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasPlay ?festivalPlay .
  ?festivalPlay :playName ?playName .
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?playName
```

This query retrieves the names of plays associated with each theatre festival, allowing us to answer the competency question.
