The competency question "In what city is a certain theatre located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for cities and theatres, and an object property `locatedIn` that connects theatres to cities. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre rdf:type :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :locatedIn ?city .
}
```
