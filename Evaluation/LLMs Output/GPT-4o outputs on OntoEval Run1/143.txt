The competency question "In what city is a certain theatre located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `theatre:isLocatedIn` property, which connects a `theatre:Theatre` to a `theatre:City`. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?theatre a theatre:Theatre .
  ?theatre theatre:isLocatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}
```
