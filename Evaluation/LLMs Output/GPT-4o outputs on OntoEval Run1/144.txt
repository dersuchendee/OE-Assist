The competency question "In what city is a certain theatre located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate theatres to cities, specifically through the `locatedIn` object property which connects `Cl_Theatre` to `Cl_City`. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?theatreName ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :locatedIn ?city .
  ?theatre :hasName ?theatreName .
  ?city :hasName ?cityName .
}
```
