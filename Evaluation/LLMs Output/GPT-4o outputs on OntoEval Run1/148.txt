The competency question "In what city is a certain theatre located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate theatres to cities through the `hasLocation` property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?theatreName ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Theatre .
  ?theatre :hasLocation ?city .
  ?city a :City .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre :hasName ?theatreName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?city :hasName ?cityName . }
}
```
