**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a theatre with a specific city. While there are classes and properties related to theatres and cities, the ontology lacks a direct property or relationship that connects a theatre to a city. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by listing theatres without their associated cities.

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
}
```
