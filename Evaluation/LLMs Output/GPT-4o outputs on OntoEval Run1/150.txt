**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct property or class that associates a theatre with a city. The closest property is `:isLocatedIn`, which associates a theatre with a city, but there is no direct way to query for the city of a specific theatre using the given ontology. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :isLocatedIn ?city .
}
```
