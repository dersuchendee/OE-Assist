**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct relationship between a theatre and a city. The property `:isLocatedIn` connects a theatre to a city, but the competency question asks for the city in which a theatre is located, which is not directly represented in the ontology. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?theatre :isLocatedIn ?city .
  }
}
```
