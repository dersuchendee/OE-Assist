**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct relationship between a theatre and a city. The closest relationship is between a theatre and a city through the `:locatedIn` property, but it does not specify the city for each theatre. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying theatres and their locations if available.

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre :locatedIn ?city . }
}
```
