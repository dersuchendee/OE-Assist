**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a theatre and a city. The ontology includes classes for theatres and cities, but there is no object property that directly links a theatre to a city. The `dp_location` data property is used to specify the location of a theatre, but it is a string and not a direct link to a `Cl_City` individual. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?location
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :dp_location ?location .
}
```
