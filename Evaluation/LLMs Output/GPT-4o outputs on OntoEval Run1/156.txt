**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the specific city in which a theatre is located. It only provides the location of theatre festivals and the cities where they occur. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :theatreLocation ?city .
}
```
