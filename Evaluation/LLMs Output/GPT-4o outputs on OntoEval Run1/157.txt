**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a theatre and its city. The ontology includes a `locatedIn` property that connects a theatre to a city, but there is no direct property or class that represents the city in which a theatre is located. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?theatreName ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :theatreName ?theatreName .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?theatre :locatedIn ?city .
    ?city :cityName ?cityName .
  }
}
```
