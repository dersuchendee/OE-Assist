**Yes**

The competency question "In what city is a certain theatre located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate theatres to cities, specifically through the `Cl_TheatreLocation` class and the `hasCity` object property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?theatreName ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?theatreLocation a :Cl_TheatreLocation ;
                   :hasTheatre ?theatre ;
                   :hasCity ?city .
  ?theatre :theatreName ?theatreName .
  ?city :cityName ?cityName .
}
```
