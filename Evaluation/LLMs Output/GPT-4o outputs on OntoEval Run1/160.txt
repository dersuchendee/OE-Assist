**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a theatre with a specific city. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, and locations, but it does not explicitly model the relationship between a theatre and its city. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :locatedIn ?city .
}
```

This query attempts to find theatres and their associated cities, but without additional data or properties explicitly linking theatres to cities, it may not return complete or accurate results.
