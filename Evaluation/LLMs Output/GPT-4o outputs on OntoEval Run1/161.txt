**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about the city in which a theatre is located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and other related concepts, but it does not explicitly model the relationship between a theatre and its city location. Therefore, the competency question "In what city is a certain theatre located?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying theatres, but without their city locations:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
}
```
