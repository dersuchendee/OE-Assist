**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a theatre and its city. The `locatedIn` property connects a theatre to a city, but there is no class or property that directly represents a theatre in the ontology. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying cities where theatre festivals take place, which might imply the presence of theatres.

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :takesPlaceIn ?city .
}
```
