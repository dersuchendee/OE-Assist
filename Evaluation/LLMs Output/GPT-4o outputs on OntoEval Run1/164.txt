**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about the geographic location of a theatre. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and other related concepts, but it does not explicitly model the location of a theatre in a city. Therefore, the competency question "In what city is a certain theatre located?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying theatres, but without their specific city locations:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
}
```

This query will return a list of theatres, but it will not provide the city in which each theatre is located, as that information is not present in the ontology.
