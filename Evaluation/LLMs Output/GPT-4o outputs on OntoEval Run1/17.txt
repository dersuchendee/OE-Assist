**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a musical instrument with the specific year it was invented. The `wasInventedDuring` property links a musical instrument to a time period, but not to a specific invention event or year. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?instrument ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?instrument a :MusicalInstrument .
  ?instrument :wasInventedDuring ?timePeriod .
}
```
