**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to relate a city to a country, which is necessary to answer the competency question. However, we can extract partial information about cities and their locations.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?location
WHERE {
  ?city a :City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?location .
}
```
