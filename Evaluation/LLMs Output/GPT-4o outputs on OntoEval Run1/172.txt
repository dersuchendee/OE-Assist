**Yes**

The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for cities and countries, and the object property `:isLocatedIn` connects cities to countries. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
}
```

This query retrieves the city and the country it is located in, which directly answers the competency question.
