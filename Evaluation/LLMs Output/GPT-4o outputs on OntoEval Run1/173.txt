**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the country in which a city is located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to cities and countries, but it lacks a direct property or relationship that connects a specific city to a specific country. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying cities, but not their corresponding countries.

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
}
```
