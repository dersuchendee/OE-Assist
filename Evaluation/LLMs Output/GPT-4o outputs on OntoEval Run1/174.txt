**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and a country. The ontology includes classes and properties related to cities and countries, but it lacks a direct property or relationship that specifies which country a city is located in. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract cities:

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
}
```
