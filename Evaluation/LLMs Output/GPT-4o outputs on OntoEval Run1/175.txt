**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the country in which a city is located. The ontology includes classes for cities and countries, and a property `isLocatedInCountry` that connects cities to countries, but it does not provide instances or data that would allow us to answer the competency question directly.

Partial answer SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedInCountry ?country .
}
```

This query would retrieve cities and their associated countries if instances of cities and countries were present in the ontology data. However, without specific instances, the query cannot provide a complete answer.
