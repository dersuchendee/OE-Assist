**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about countries or their relationships with cities. Therefore, the competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about cities present in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
}
```
