**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about countries or the relationship between cities and countries. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the cities present in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
}
```
