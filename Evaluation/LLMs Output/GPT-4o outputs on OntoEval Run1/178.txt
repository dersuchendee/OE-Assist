**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the countries in which cities are located. However, it does provide information about cities and their relationships with other entities. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists the cities mentioned in the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
}
```
