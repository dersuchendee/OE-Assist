**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and the country it is located in. The ontology includes a class `Cl_City` with a data property `isLocatedInCountry`, but there is no direct link between a city and a specific country instance. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedInCountry ?country .
}
```
