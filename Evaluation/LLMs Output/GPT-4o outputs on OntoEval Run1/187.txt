**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about countries or their relationship with cities. Therefore, the competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about cities.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?city :isLocatedInCountry ?location .
    ?location :countryName ?country .
  }
}
```
