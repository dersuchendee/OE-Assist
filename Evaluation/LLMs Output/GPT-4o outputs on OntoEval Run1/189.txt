The competency question "What play is the basis of this production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:hasBasis` property, which associates a `:Production` with a `:Play`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the play that is the basis for each production.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?production a :Production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }

  ?production :hasBasis ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
```
