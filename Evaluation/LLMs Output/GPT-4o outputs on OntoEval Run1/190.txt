**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a production and the play it is based on. The ontology includes classes and properties related to productions, plays, and their relationships, but it lacks a specific property that directly links a production to the play it is based on. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPlay ?play .
}
```

This query attempts to find productions and their associated plays, but it does not directly answer the competency question about the basis of a production.
