**No**

The ontology provided does not contain a direct relationship between a theatre production and the play it is based on. The ontology includes classes and properties related to plays, productions, and theatre festivals, but it lacks a specific property that directly links a production to the play it is based on. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying productions and their associated plays, if any, through available properties:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_TheatreProduction .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?play a :Cl_Play .
    ?play :isBasisOf ?production .
  }
}
```
