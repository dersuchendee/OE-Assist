**Yes**

The competency question "What play is the basis of this production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:isBasedOn` object property, which connects a `:Cl_Production` to a `:Cl_Play`. This allows us to query for the play that serves as the basis for a given production.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :isBasedOn ?play .
}
```
