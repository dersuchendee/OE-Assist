**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between an instrument realization and the person who built it. The ontology includes a class for instrument realization (`Cl_InstrumentRealization`) and a property for who realized the instrument (`Op_realizedBy`), but it does not include a property for who built the instrument realization. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract information about instrument realizations and who realized them:

```sparql
SELECT ?instrumentRealization ?person
WHERE {
  ?instrumentRealization a :Cl_InstrumentRealization .
  ?instrumentRealization :Op_realizedBy ?person .
}
```
