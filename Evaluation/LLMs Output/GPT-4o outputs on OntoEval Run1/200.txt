**Yes**

The competency question "What play is the basis of this production?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `Cl_TheatreProduction` and the object property `op_isBasedOnPlay`, which connects a theatre production to the play it is based on. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_TheatreProduction .
  ?production :op_isBasedOnPlay ?play .
}
```
