The competency question "What play is the basis of this production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:basedOnPlay` object property, which links a `:Cl_Production` to a `:Cl_Play`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the play that is the basis of a given production.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?productionName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
  ?production :basedOnPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
```
