**No**

The ontology does not directly model the relationship between a production and its basis play. However, we can extract partial information about productions and plays.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?productionName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
  ?production :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
```
