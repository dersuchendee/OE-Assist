**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct connection between a production and the play it is based on. The `basedOnPlay` property connects a `Cl_Production` to a `Cl_ProductionPlay`, but there is no direct way to retrieve the play that is the basis of a production. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :basedOnPlay ?play .
}
```
