**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a production and the play it is based on. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and other related concepts, but it lacks a direct property or class that links a specific production to the play it is based on. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :basedOnPlay ?play .
}
```

This query assumes the existence of a `:basedOnPlay` property, which is not explicitly defined in the provided ontology.
