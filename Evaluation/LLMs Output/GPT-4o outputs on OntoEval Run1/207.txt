**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct connection between a production and the play it is based on. The ontology includes classes and properties related to productions, plays, and their relationships, but it lacks a direct way to query which play is the basis of a specific production. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on productions and their titles:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :isBasedOn ?productionBase .
  ?productionBase :playTitle ?playTitle .
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve the play titles associated with productions, but without a direct link to the specific play that serves as the basis for each production, it cannot fully answer the competency question.
