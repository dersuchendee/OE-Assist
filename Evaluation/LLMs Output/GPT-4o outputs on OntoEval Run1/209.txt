**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a production and the play it is based on. The property `:isBasedOnPlay` is a datatype property with a range of `xsd:string`, which means it stores the name of the play as a string rather than linking to an instance of `:Cl_Play`. Therefore, we cannot directly query for the play that a production is based on using the ontology's structure.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?production ?playName
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :isBasedOnPlay ?playName .
}
```
