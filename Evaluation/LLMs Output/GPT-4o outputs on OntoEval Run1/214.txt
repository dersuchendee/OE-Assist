**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate ensembles with specific points in time. While there are time-indexed roles and productions, the concept of an ensemble at a specific time is not explicitly modeled. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on roles and productions:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?role ?production ?time
WHERE {
  ?member ns1:memberOf ?ensemble .
  ?member ns1:performsRole ?role .
  ?role ns1:inProduction ?production .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?member ns1:hasTimeInterval ?interval .
    ?interval ns1:startTime ?startTime .
    ?interval ns1:endTime ?endTime .
  }
}
```
