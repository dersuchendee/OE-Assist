**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate ensembles with specific points in time. While there are classes and properties related to ensembles and actors, there is no explicit representation of time-specific membership within an ensemble. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract ensemble members:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a theatre:Ensemble .
  ?ensemble theatre:hasMember ?member .
}
```
