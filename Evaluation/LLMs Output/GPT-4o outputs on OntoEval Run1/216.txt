**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for members of an ensemble at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to ensembles, members, and time, but it lacks a direct connection or reification that would allow querying for ensemble membership at a specific time point. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership .
  ?membership :ensembleInMembership ?ensemble .
  ?membership :memberInMembership ?member .
}
```

This query retrieves ensembles and their members but does not include the time aspect, which is necessary to fully answer the competency question.
