**No**

The ontology provided does not contain explicit information about ensemble membership at specific points in time. While it does include classes and properties related to ensembles, productions, and actors, it lacks the necessary temporal information to answer the competency question about ensemble membership at a certain point in time. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted, but it will not include the temporal aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?actor
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?actor .
}
```
