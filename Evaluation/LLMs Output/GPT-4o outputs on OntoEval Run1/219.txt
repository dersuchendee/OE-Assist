The competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for ensemble memberships and their associated dates.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?actor ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?actor .
  ?actor :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :hasMembershipDate ?membershipDate .
}
ORDER BY ?ensemble ?membershipDate
```

This query retrieves the ensemble, actor, and membership date, allowing us to determine the members of a certain ensemble at a specific point in time.
