The competency question "Which water bodies belong to a specific water basin?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the necessary classes and object properties to establish relationships between water bodies and water basins. Specifically, the `:op_belongsTo` property connects `:Cl_WaterBody` to `:Cl_WaterBasin`, allowing us to query which water bodies belong to a specific basin.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?waterBody ?waterBodyLabel ?waterBasin ?waterBasinLabel
WHERE {
  ?waterBody a :Cl_WaterBody .
  ?waterBody :op_belongsTo ?waterBasin .

  OPTIONAL { ?waterBody rdfs:label ?waterBodyLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?waterBasin rdfs:label ?waterBasinLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?waterBasin ?waterBody
```
