**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for members of an ensemble at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to ensembles, actors, and productions, but it lacks a direct connection between ensembles and specific time points. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?actor
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?actor .
}
```
