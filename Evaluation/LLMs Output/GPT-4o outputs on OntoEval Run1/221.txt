The competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to identify members of an ensemble and their membership dates.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?member .
  ?member :hasMembershipDate ?membershipDate .
}
ORDER BY ?ensemble ?membershipDate
```

This query retrieves the ensemble, its members, and the date of their membership, allowing us to determine who the members are at a specific point in time.
