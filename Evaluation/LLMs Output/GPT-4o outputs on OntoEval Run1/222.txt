**No**

The ontology provided does not contain explicit information about ensembles or their members at specific points in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to festivals, plays, theatres, productions, and individuals, but it lacks the necessary structure to directly query for ensemble memberships at specific times.

However, we can extract partial information about individuals and their ensemble memberships without the temporal aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?individual ?individualName ?ensemble
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?individual .
  ?individual :hasName ?individualName .
}
```

This query retrieves individuals and their associated ensembles, but it does not include the temporal aspect of the ensemble membership, which is required to fully answer the competency question.
