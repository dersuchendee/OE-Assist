**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, ensembles, and ensemble memberships, but it lacks a direct connection between ensembles and specific points in time. The closest available information is the `Cl_EnsembleMembership` class, which associates actors with ensembles and includes a time property (`atTime`), but it does not directly link to a specific ensemble.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?ensemble ?time
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership ;
              :hasMember ?actor ;
              :atTime ?time .
  ?actor :performedIn ?ensemble .
}
```
