**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to query for the members of an ensemble at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and actors, but it lacks a direct connection between ensemble membership and specific time periods.

However, we can extract partial information about ensemble memberships and their associated dates, but not specifically tied to a certain point in time as required by the competency question.

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?actor ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership .
  ?membership :actorName ?actor .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
}
```
