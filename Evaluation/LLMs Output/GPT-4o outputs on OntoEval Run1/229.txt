**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to associate an ensemble with its members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between an ensemble and its members with a specific time context.

However, we can extract partial information about ensembles and their members without the time context:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?memberName
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership .
  ?membership :memberName ?memberName .
}
```

This query retrieves ensembles and their members, but it does not include the temporal aspect required by the competency question.
