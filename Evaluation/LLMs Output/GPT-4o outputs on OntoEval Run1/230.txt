**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to ensembles or their members. The ontology primarily focuses on theatre festivals, plays, productions, and related entities, but it lacks the necessary structure to represent ensembles and their memberships.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on productions and roles, which might be indirectly related to ensembles:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?roleName ?roleDate
WHERE {
  ?productionRole a :Cl_ProductionRole .
  ?productionRole :roleName ?roleName .
  ?productionRole :roleDate ?roleDate .
}
```
