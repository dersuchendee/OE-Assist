**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate members with a specific ensemble at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to ensembles, productions, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific ensemble and its members at a specific time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?production
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?member .
  ?production :hasEnsemble ?ensemble .
}
```

This query retrieves ensembles, their members, and the productions they are associated with, but it does not include temporal information.
