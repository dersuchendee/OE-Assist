**Yes**

The competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to ensembles, ensemble memberships, and persons, as well as a membership date property that can be used to filter members by a specific point in time.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?person ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership .
  ?membership :member ?person .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
  
  # Filter for a specific point in time, e.g., "2007-01-01"
  FILTER(?membershipDate <= "2007-01-01"^^xsd:date)
}
ORDER BY ?ensemble ?membershipDate
```

This query retrieves the members of ensembles and their membership dates, allowing you to determine who was a member at a specific point in time. Adjust the date in the FILTER clause to match the desired point in time.
