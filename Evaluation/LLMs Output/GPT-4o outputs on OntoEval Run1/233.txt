**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to ensembles or their members. Therefore, the competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to ensembles, but it will not include specific members or time points.

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
}
```
