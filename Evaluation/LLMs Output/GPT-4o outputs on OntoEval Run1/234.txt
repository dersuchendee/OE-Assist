The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes classes for authors and plays, and there is an object property `op_writtenBy` that connects plays to their authors. We can write a SPARQL query to extract the plays written by a specific author.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?title
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :op_writtenBy :WilliamShakespeare .
  ?play :dp_title ?title .
}
```
