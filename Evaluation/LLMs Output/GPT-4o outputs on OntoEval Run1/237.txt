The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `ns1:wrotePlay` property, which associates an author with the plays they have written. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?authorLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a ns1:Author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorLabel . }
  
  ?author ns1:wrotePlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?author ?play
```
