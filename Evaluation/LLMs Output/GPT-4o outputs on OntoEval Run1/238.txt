The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate authors to the plays they have written. Specifically, the `theatre:Author` class and the `theatre:wrote` property can be used to find the plays written by a specific author.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a theatre:Author ;
          rdfs:label "William Shakespeare" ;
          theatre:wrote ?play .
  ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel .
}
```

This query retrieves the plays written by William Shakespeare, using the `theatre:wrote` property to link authors to their plays.
