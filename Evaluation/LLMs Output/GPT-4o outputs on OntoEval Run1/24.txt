The ontology provides a classification of different types of water bodies, which can be used to answer the competency question about the types of water bodies that can be listed. The SPARQL query to extract this information is as follows:

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?waterBodyType
WHERE {
  ?waterBodyType rdfs:subClassOf* :Cl_WaterBody .
}
```
