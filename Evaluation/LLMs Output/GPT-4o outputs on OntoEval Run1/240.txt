**No**

The ontology provided does not include any information about authors or their relationship to plays. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about plays and their titles.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?title
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  ?play :hasTitle ?title .
}
```
