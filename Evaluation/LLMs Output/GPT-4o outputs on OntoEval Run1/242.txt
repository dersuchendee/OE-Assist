**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link an author to the plays they have written. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, cities, plays, theatres, actors, ensembles, authors, newspapers, productions, and other related concepts. However, there is no explicit property or class that directly connects an author to the plays they have written.

A partial answer can be extracted by querying for authors and plays, but it will not provide the specific relationship of which plays were written by which authors.

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?play
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
}
```
