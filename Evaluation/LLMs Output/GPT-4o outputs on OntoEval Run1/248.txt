**Yes**

The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate authors to the plays they have written. Specifically, the `:hasAuthorPlay` property connects an `:Author` to an `:AuthorPlay`, which in turn is connected to a `:Play` via the `:writtenPlay` property.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?authorLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author ;
          rdfs:label ?authorLabel ;
          :hasAuthorPlay ?authorPlay .
  ?authorPlay :writtenPlay ?play .
  ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel .
}
```
