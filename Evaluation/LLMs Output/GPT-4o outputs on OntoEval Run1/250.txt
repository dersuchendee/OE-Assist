The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate authors to plays, specifically through the `Cl_AuthorPlay` class and the `hasAuthor` and `hasPlay` properties.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?playName
WHERE {
  ?authorPlay a :Cl_AuthorPlay ;
              :hasAuthor :Author_WilliamShakespeare ;
              :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
```

This query retrieves the names of plays written by the author William Shakespeare, as represented in the ontology.
