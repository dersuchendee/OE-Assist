**No**

The ontology provided does not contain a direct connection between an author and the plays they have written. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, locations, plays, productions, and authorship, but it does not explicitly model the relationship between an author and the plays they have written. Therefore, the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying plays and authorship, but without directly linking them:

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?authorName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author :authorName ?authorName . }
  
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
}
```
