**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct connection between authors and the plays they have written. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and other related entities, but it lacks a direct representation of authorship that would allow us to query which plays a certain author has written.

However, we can extract partial information about plays and their related entities:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
}
```

This query retrieves all plays and their names, but it does not connect them to specific authors.
