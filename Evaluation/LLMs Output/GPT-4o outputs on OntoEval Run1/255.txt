The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Author` and the object property `wrotePlay` which connects an author to a play (`Cl_Play`). Therefore, we can construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the plays written by a specific author.

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?play
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  ?author :wrotePlay ?play .
}
```
