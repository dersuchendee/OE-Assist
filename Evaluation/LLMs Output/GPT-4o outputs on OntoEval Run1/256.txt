**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about authors or their written works. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about plays that are part of theatre festivals.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
```
