The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides information about plays and their writing periods, including start and end years. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :op_hasWritingPeriod ?writingPeriod .
  ?writingPeriod :dp_startYear ?startYear .
  ?writingPeriod :dp_endYear ?endYear .
}
```
