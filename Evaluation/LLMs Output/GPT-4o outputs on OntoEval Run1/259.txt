The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate to plays and their writing periods, specifically the `Cl_Play` class and the `Cl_WritingPeriod` class, along with the `op_hasWritingPeriod` object property and the `dp_startYear` and `dp_endYear` data properties. These elements allow us to query the writing period of a play.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?title ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :dp_title ?title ;
        :op_hasWritingPeriod ?writingPeriod .
  ?writingPeriod :dp_startYear ?startYear ;
                 :dp_endYear ?endYear .
}
```
