**Yes**

The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about plays and the time periods during which they were written, as indicated by the `ns1:wasWrittenDuring` property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?startTime ?endTime
WHERE {
  ?play a ns1:Play .
  ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel .
  ?play ns1:wasWrittenDuring ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod ns1:hasStartTime ?startTime .
  ?timePeriod ns1:hasEndTime ?endTime .
}
```
