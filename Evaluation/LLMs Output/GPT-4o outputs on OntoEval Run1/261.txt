The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about plays, their authors, and the time periods during which they were written. The relevant classes and properties are `theatre:Play`, `theatre:hasTimePeriod`, `theatre:TimePeriod`, `theatre:hasStartDate`, and `theatre:hasEndDate`.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?play a theatre:Play .
  ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel .
  ?play theatre:hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod theatre:hasStartDate ?startDate .
  ?timePeriod theatre:hasEndDate ?endDate .
}
```
