The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to plays and their time periods, specifically the `Cl_PlayTimePeriod` class and the `startYear` and `endYear` properties. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?playTimePeriod a :Cl_PlayTimePeriod .
  ?playTimePeriod :hasPlay ?play .
  ?playTimePeriod :startYear ?startYear .
  ?playTimePeriod :endYear ?endYear .
}
```
