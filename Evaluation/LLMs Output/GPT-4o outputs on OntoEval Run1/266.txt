The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:Cl_Play` class and the `:writtenDuring` datatype property, which allows us to query the time period during which a play was written.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?writtenPeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?writtenPeriod .
}
```
