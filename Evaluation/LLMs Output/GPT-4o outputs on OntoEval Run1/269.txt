**Yes**

The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `dp_writtenStartDate` and `dp_writtenEndDate` data properties for the `Cl_Play` class, which allows us to determine the time period during which a play was written.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :dp_writtenStartDate ?startYear .
  ?play :dp_writtenEndDate ?endYear .
}
```
