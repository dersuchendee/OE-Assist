The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about plays and their writing periods, which are represented by the `Cl_PlayWritingPeriod` class and associated properties `writingStartDate` and `writingEndDate`.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the writing period for a specific play:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        rdfs:label ?playLabel ;
        :hasWritingPeriod ?writingPeriod .
  ?writingPeriod :writingStartDate ?startDate ;
                 :writingEndDate ?endDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the play's label and its writing start and end dates, allowing us to determine the time period during which the play was written.
