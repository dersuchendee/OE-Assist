**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the time period during which a play was written. The ontology includes a property `:writtenDuring` that links a play to a time period, but it does not provide specific dates or a range of years for when the play was written. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName ;
        :writtenDuring ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :timePeriod ?timePeriodValue .
}
```
