**Yes**

The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_PlayCreation` which is a subclass of `Cl_Play` and `Cl_TimePeriod`, and it has a data property `timePeriod` that can be used to determine the time period during which a play was written.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?creation .
  ?creation a :Cl_PlayCreation .
  ?creation :timePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
```
