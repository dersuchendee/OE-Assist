**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the time period during which a play was written. The ontology includes a class `Cl_PlayCreation` with a property `creationPeriod`, but there is no direct connection to a specific play or author that would allow us to extract this information. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?creationPeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :wasWrittenDuring ?creation .
  ?creation :creationPeriod ?creationPeriod .
}
```
