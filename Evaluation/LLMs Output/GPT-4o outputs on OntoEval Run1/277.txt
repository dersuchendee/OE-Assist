**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the time period during which a play was written. The closest related information is the `writtenDuring` property, which connects a play to a time period, but there is no data property or class that specifies the actual time period value for a play. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?play ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?timePeriod .
}
```
