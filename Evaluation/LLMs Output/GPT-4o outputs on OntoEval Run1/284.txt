The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `theatre:Play` class and the `theatre:hasNumberOfActs` datatype property, which allows us to query the number of acts for a specific play.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the number of acts for a particular play:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a theatre:Play .
  ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel .
  ?play theatre:hasNumberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```

This query retrieves the play, its label, and the number of acts it contains, which directly answers the competency question.
