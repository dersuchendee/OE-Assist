The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `:Play` and the object property `:hasAct`, which relates a play to its acts. We can count the number of acts associated with a particular play using a SPARQL query.

```sparql
SELECT ?play (COUNT(?act) AS ?numberOfActs)
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  ?play :hasAct ?act .
}
GROUP BY ?play
```

This query retrieves the number of acts for each play in the ontology.
