The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:Cl_Play` class with a `:containsActs` datatype property, which specifies the number of acts in a play. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract this information.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?numActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :containsActs ?numActs .
}
```
