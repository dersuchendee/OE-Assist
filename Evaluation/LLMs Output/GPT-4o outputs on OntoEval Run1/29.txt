The competency question "What are the roles of this actor in this network?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines the relationship between an actor and their roles through the `:hasRole` property. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the roles of an actor:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Actor .
  ?actor :hasRole ?role .
}
```
