The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_Play` and the property `:hasAct`, which connects a play to its acts. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to count the number of acts for a specific play.

```sparql
SELECT ?play (COUNT(?act) AS ?numActs)
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :hasAct ?act .
}
GROUP BY ?play
```
