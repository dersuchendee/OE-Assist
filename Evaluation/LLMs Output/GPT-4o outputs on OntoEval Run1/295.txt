The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:numberOfActs` property associated with the `:Cl_Play` class, which allows us to query the number of acts for a specific play.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the number of acts for a particular play:

```sparql
SELECT ?playName ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play rdf:type :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName ;
        :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```

This query retrieves the name of the play and the number of acts it contains, which directly answers the competency question.
