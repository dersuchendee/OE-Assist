The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Play` and the datatype property `numberOfActs`, which allows us to query the number of acts for a specific play.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the number of acts for a particular play:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```
