**Yes**

The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Production` with the data property `hasPremiereDate`, which allows us to query for the premiere date of a production.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premiereDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremiereDate ?premiereDate .
}
```
