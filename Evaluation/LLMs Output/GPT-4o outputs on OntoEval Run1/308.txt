**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific date with the premier of a production. The ontology includes classes and properties related to productions, premier events, and dates, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific production and its premier date. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying productions and their associated premier events, but without the specific date.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierEvent
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?premierEvent a :Cl_PremierEvent .
  ?premierEvent :productionOf ?production .
}
```
