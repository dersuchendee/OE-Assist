**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any properties or classes that directly relate to the action of viewing a product. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, roles, and resources, but there is no explicit connection between an actor and a product through a "viewing" action. Therefore, the competency question "Who viewed a product?" cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying actors who have a role related to resources, but this does not specifically address the action of viewing:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor
WHERE {
  ?relation a :ViewingResource .
  ?relation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
}
```

This query attempts to find actors involved in any resource relation, but it does not specifically identify those who viewed a product, as the ontology lacks the necessary properties to make this distinction.
