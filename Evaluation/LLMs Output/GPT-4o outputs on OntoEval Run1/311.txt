The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre productions, including the concept of a production premier and its date. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the premier date of a specific production:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the premier date for each production in the ontology. If you have a specific production in mind, you can add a filter to the query to narrow down the results.
