The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:premierDate` property associated with the `:Cl_Production` class, which allows us to query the premier date of a production.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the premier date of a specific production:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
