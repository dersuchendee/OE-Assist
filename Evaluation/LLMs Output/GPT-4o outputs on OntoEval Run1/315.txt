The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_TheatreProduction` with a data property `dp_premierDate` that specifies the premier date of a production. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the premier date of a specific production:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_TheatreProduction .
  ?production :dp_premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the premier date for each theatre production in the ontology. If you want to find the premier date for a specific production, you can add a filter or specify the production URI directly in the query.
