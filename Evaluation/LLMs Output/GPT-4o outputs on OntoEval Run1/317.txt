The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about productions and their premieres, specifically through the `:hasPremiere` and `:premiereDate` properties. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the premiere date of a specific production:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premiereDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremiere ?premiere .
  ?premiere :premiereDate ?premiereDate .
}
```
