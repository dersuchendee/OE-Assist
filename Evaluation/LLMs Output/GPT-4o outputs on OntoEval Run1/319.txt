The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to productions and their premier dates, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the premier date of a specific production.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the premier date of a specific production:

```sparql
SELECT ?productionName ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production rdf:type :Cl_Production ;
               :productionName ?productionName ;
               :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier rdf:type :Cl_ProductionPremier ;
           :hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the name of the production and its premier date by navigating through the `:hasPremier` property to the `:Cl_ProductionPremier` class, where the `:hasPremierDate` property is used to get the date.
