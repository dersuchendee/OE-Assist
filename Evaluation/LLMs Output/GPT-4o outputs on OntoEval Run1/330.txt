The competency question "What is the “star rating” given by a certain newspaper for a certain production?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties related to productions, reviews, and newspapers, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the star rating for a specific production reviewed by a specific newspaper.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?newspaper ?newspaperLabel ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?review a theatre:Review ;
          theatre:hasStarRating ?starRating ;
          theatre:isReviewOf ?production ;
          theatre:publishedIn ?newspaper .

  ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel .
  ?newspaper rdfs:label ?newspaperLabel .
}
```

This query retrieves the production, the newspaper, and the star rating from the ontology, allowing us to answer the competency question.
