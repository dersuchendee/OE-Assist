**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link actors to specific CVNs they are participating in. The ontology defines classes and properties related to actors, roles, and CVNs, but it lacks a direct property or class that connects an actor to a specific CVN. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying actors and their roles, but not the specific CVNs they are part of.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role
WHERE {
  ?participation a actor:CVNParticipation .
  ?participation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  ?participation actorODP:participantRole ?role .
}
```
