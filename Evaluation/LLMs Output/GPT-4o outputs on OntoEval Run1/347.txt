**No**

The ontology does not contain any properties or classes that directly relate to newspapers or star ratings for productions. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about productions and reviews.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?review
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production :reviews ?review . }
}
```
