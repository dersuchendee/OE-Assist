The ontology provides a structure to identify actors involved in processes through the `actorODP:participatingActor` property, which links actors to their participation in processes. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the actors involved in any process:

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?actor ?process
WHERE {
  ?participation a actor:ProcessParticipation .
  ?participation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  ?participation actorODP:participationIn ?process .
}
```
