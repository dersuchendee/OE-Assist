**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the start date of an actor's employment with a specific theatre. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, theatres, and employment, but it lacks a direct connection between an actor's employment and the specific theatre they work for, along with the start date of that employment.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?employmentDate ?theatre
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment :hasEmploymentDate ?employmentDate .
  ?employment :isEmployedIn ?theatre .
}
```
