**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate an actor with a specific theatre and the start date of their employment. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, theatres, and employment, but it lacks a direct connection between an actor, a specific theatre, and the start date of employment. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment .
  ?employment :employedActor ?actor .
  ?employment :atTheatre ?theatre .
  ?employment :startDate ?startDate .
}
```
