**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to extract actors involved in a process. The ontology defines a relationship between actors and work processes, and between work processes and processes, but it does not directly connect actors to processes. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying actors involved in work processes.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :op_involvedIn ?workProcess .
}
```
