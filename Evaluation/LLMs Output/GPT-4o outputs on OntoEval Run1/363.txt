**Yes**

The competency question "At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about actor employment, including the start date of employment at a specific theatre. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?employment rdf:type :Cl_ActorEmployment ;
              :employmentActor ?actor ;
              :employedAt ?theatre ;
              :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?actor ?startDate
```

This query retrieves the actor, the theatre they are employed at, and the start date of their employment, which directly answers the competency question.
