**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link an actor to a specific theatre and the start date of their employment. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, theatres, and dates, but it lacks a direct connection between an actor and a specific theatre employment start date.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?theatre ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor :actorName ?actorName . }
  ?actor :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment .
  OPTIONAL { ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate . }
}
