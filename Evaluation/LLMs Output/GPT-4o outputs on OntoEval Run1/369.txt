**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate an actor with a specific theatre and the time they started working there. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a person (actor) and their employment start date at a specific theatre.

Partial answer SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :employedAt ?theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?person :employmentStartDate ?startDate . }
}
```
