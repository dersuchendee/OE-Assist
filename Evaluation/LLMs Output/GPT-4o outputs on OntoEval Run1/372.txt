**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the roles a person has within a production at a specific time, which can be extracted using the reified class `Cl_PersonRoleInProduction`. Here's the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?role ?production ?productionTitle ?time
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasName ?personName .

  ?person :hasPersonRoleInProduction ?personRoleInProduction .
  ?personRoleInProduction :withRole ?role .
  ?personRoleInProduction :inProduction ?production .
  ?personRoleInProduction :atTime ?time .

  ?production :hasTitle ?productionTitle .
}
ORDER BY ?person ?production ?time
```
