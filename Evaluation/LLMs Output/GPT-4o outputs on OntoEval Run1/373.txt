**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a specific production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for roles, performances, and time-indexed roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, a role, a production, and a specific time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?production ?time
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :hasTimeIndexedRole ?timeIndexedRole .
  ?timeIndexedRole :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :performedIn ?production .
  OPTIONAL { ?timeIndexedRole :hasTime ?time . }
}
```
