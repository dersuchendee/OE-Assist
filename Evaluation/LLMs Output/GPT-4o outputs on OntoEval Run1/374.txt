**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the roles a person has within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to people, roles, productions, and time, but it lacks a direct connection or reification that ties all these elements together in a way that allows for querying roles at specific times.

However, we can extract partial information about the roles a person has within a production, but without the time aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?role ?roleName ?production ?productionTitle
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasName ?personName .
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :hasRoleName ?roleName .
  ?person :participatesIn ?production .
  ?production :hasTitle ?productionTitle .
}
```

This query retrieves the roles a person has within a production, but it does not include the time aspect, which is necessary to fully answer the competency question.
