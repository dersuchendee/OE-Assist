**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to roles, productions, and time points, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements to answer the competency question fully. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?production
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?role a :Cl_Role .
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?person :assignedRoleAssignment ?roleAssignment .
  ?role :roleAssignmentOfRole ?roleAssignment .
  ?production :roleAssignmentInProduction ?roleAssignment .
}
```
