**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate members of an ensemble with a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for ensembles, members, and performances, but it lacks a temporal component to specify when a person was a member of an ensemble. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract ensemble members without temporal information:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?memberName
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?member .
  ?member :hasName ?memberName .
}
```
