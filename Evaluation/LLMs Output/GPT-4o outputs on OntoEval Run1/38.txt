**No**

The ontology does not explicitly define a relationship between actors and the information they hold. However, we can extract partial information about actors and their roles, which might imply their involvement in processes that require information.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role
WHERE {
  ?participation a actorODP:Participation .
  ?participation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  ?participation actorODP:participantRole ?role .
}
```
