**No**

The ontology provided does not have explicit classes or properties that directly relate to roles, persons, productions, and time in a way that would allow us to answer the competency question. The ontology does not have a clear representation of roles within a production or a way to associate a person with a specific role at a specific time within a production. 

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on productions and their associated persons:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?production
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?person :partOf ?production .
}
```

This query retrieves persons and the productions they are part of, but it does not provide information about specific roles or time points within the production.
