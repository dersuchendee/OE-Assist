**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with specific roles within a production at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, productions, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their roles, and the specific time they performed those roles within a production.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role ?production
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :hasRoleInProduction ?production .
}
```

This query retrieves actors, their roles, and the productions they are associated with, but it does not include the specific time information required by the competency question.
