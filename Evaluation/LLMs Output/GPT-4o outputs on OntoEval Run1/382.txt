**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with their roles within a specific production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, productions, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their roles, and the time they performed those roles within a specific production.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role ?production
WHERE {
  ?actorRole a :Cl_ActorRole .
  ?actorRole :playedBy ?actor .
  ?actorRole :inProduction ?production .
  OPTIONAL { ?actorRole :date ?date . }
}
```
