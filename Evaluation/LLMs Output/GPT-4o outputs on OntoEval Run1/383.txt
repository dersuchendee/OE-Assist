**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, roles, productions, and dates, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, the production, and the time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?production
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Actor .
  ?role a :Cl_ActorRole .
  ?role :hasRole ?production .
}
```
