**No**

The ontology provided does not contain explicit information about roles within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to festivals, plays, theatres, ensembles, individuals, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, a production, and a specific time for role assignments. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying individuals and their roles, but without the specific production and time context:

```sparql
SELECT ?individual ?individualName ?role ?roleName
WHERE {
  ?individual a :Cl_Individual ;
              :hasName ?individualName ;
              :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
}
```
