**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate roles with specific points in time within a production. The ontology includes classes and properties for roles, role assignments, and productions, but it lacks a direct temporal component to specify when a role is held within a production. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted, but it will not include the temporal aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?production
WHERE {
  ?roleAssignment :op_roleOf ?person ;
                   :op_hasRole ?role ;
                   :op_roleInProduction ?production .
}
```
