**No**

The ontology provided does not include any information about the roles that a person has within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, actors, and roles, but it does not explicitly connect a person to a role within a production at a specific time. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the roles associated with a production and the actors involved, but without the specific time information:

```sparql
SELECT ?actorName ?roleName ?productionName
WHERE {
  ?actorRole rdf:type :Cl_ActorRole ;
             :hasRole ?role ;
             :roleInProduction ?production .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
  ?actorRole :hasMember ?actor .
  ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
}
```
