**No**

The ontology provided does not include any information about roles that a person might have within a production. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, actors, and their employment, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and their specific roles within a production at a certain point in time.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the actors and productions:

```sparql
SELECT ?actorName ?productionName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?actor rdf:type :Cl_Actor ;
         :actorName ?actorName .
  ?production rdf:type :Cl_Production ;
              :productionName ?productionName .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?ensembleMembership rdf:type :Cl_EnsembleMembership ;
                        :hasMember ?actor ;
                        :hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  }
}
```

This query retrieves the names of actors and productions, along with any time periods associated with the ensemble memberships, but it does not provide specific roles within the productions.
