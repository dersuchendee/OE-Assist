**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to roles, specific productions, or time points within a production. The ontology primarily focuses on theatre festivals, locations, plays, and actors, but lacks the necessary structure to capture the roles of individuals within specific productions at specific times.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying actors and their associated productions, but without specific roles or time points.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?production
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :basedOnPlay ?play .
}
```
