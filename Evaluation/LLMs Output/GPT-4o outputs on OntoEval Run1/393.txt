**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for roles, productions, and dates, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements to answer the competency question fully. However, we can extract partial information about roles and productions.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?roleName ?production
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
  ?role :roleInProduction ?production .
}
```
