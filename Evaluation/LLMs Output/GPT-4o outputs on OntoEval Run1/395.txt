**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to roles, persons, or productions in a way that would allow us to answer the competency question about the roles a person has within a production at a certain point in time. The ontology primarily focuses on theatre festivals, plays, locations, and dates, but lacks the necessary structure to represent roles and their assignments to individuals within productions.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?production ?date
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?date a :Cl_Date .
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of persons, productions, and dates, but it does not provide the specific role information required by the competency question.
