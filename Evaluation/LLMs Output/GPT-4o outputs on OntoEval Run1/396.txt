**Yes**

The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Cl_Production` class that specifies it must have exactly one `hasPremierEvent`. This aligns with the competency question, allowing us to write a SPARQL query to verify this condition.

```sparql
SELECT ?production
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremierEvent ?premierEvent .
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premierEvent) = 1)
```
