The competency question "Which is the type of a source?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for different types of sources (e.g., `Cl_PrimarySource`, `Cl_SecondarySource`) and an object property `hasSourceType` that relates a source to its type. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the type of each source.

```sparql
SELECT ?source ?sourceType
WHERE {
  ?source a :Cl_Source .
  ?source :hasSourceType ?sourceType .
}
```
