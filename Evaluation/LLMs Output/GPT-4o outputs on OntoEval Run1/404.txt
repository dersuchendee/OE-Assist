The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Production` and the property `hasPremier` which connects a production to its premier. The class `Cl_ProductionPremier` is used to represent the premier of a production. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract productions that have exactly one premier.

```sparql
SELECT ?production
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?production :hasPremier ?otherPremier .
    FILTER(?otherPremier != ?premier)
  }
}
```
