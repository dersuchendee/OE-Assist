The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Cl_Production` class that specifies a cardinality of 1 for the `premierDate` property, indicating that each production has exactly one premier date. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the premier date for each production:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
