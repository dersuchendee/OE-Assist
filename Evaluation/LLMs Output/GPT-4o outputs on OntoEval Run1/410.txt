The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Cl_Production` class that enforces a cardinality of exactly one for the `hasPremiere` property, which aligns with the competency question.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract productions with exactly one premiere:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premiere
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremiere ?premiere .
}
```
