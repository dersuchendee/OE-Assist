**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine that a production has exactly one premier. The ontology includes a class `Cl_ProductionPremier` and an object property `hasPremier`, but it does not enforce cardinality constraints to ensure that a production has exactly one premier. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract productions with their premiers:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
