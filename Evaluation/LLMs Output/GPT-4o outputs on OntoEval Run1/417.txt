The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the `:premierDate` property, which is defined as a functional property, meaning each production can have exactly one premier date. This aligns with the competency question.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the premier date for each production:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
