**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with the instruments they play. The `playsInstrument` property is defined, but there is no data or reification class that connects a person to an instrument through this property. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying persons and instruments, but not the specific instruments played by each person.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?instrument a :Cl_Instrument .
}
```
