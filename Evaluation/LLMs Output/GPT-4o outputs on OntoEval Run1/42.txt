**No**

The ontology does not directly provide a property or class that links an actor to its type. The ontology includes a class `Cl_ActorType` and an object property `actorHasTypeRole` that links an actor to `Cl_ActorTypeRole`, which in turn is linked to `Cl_ActorType` through `hasActorType`. However, there is no direct link from `Cl_Actor` to `Cl_ActorType`.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorType
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :actorHasTypeRole ?actorTypeRole .
  ?actorTypeRole :hasActorType ?actorType .
}
```
