**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with the instruments they play. The ontology includes classes and properties related to musical groups, albums, tracks, and performances, but it lacks a specific property or class that connects a person to the instruments they play. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?name ?band
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasName ?name .
  ?person :memberOf ?bandMembership .
  ?bandMembership :hasMembership ?band .
}
```

This query retrieves the names of persons and the bands they are members of, but it does not provide information about the instruments they play.
