The competency question "What instruments does a certain person play?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `ns1:playsInstrument` property, which connects a `ns1:Person` to the `ns1:Instrument` they play. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?instrument ?instrumentLabel
WHERE {
  ?person a ns1:Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  ?person ns1:playsInstrument ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?person
