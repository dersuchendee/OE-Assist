**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a musician with the instruments they play. The ontology defines a `plays` property, but it is not used in the data provided. Therefore, we cannot directly answer the competency question with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract musicians and their roles (if any):

```sparql
SELECT ?musician ?musicianLabel ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?musician a :Musician .
  OPTIONAL { ?musician rdfs:label ?musicianLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?musician :plays ?instrument . }
}
```
