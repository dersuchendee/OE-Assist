**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the instruments that a person plays. However, we can extract partial information about the roles that a person has in a band, which might imply certain instruments.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?role ?roleName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :personName ?personName .
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
}
```
