**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct connection between a person and the instruments they play. The ontology includes classes and properties related to band membership, roles, albums, tracks, and performances, but it lacks a direct representation of the relationship between a person and the instruments they play. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the people involved in bands or performances, but without specifying the instruments they play.

```sparql
SELECT ?person
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
}
