The competency question "What instruments does a certain person play?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for `Cl_Person`, `Cl_Instrument`, and `Cl_PersonInstrument`, with properties `plays` and `playedBy` that connect a person to the instruments they play. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?instrument ?instrumentName
WHERE {
  ?personInstrument rdf:type :Cl_PersonInstrument .
  ?personInstrument :playedBy ?person .
  ?personInstrument :plays ?instrument .
  ?instrument :instrumentName ?instrumentName .
}
```
