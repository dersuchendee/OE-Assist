**No**

The ontology does not explicitly define a relationship between actors and competencies. However, we can extract partial information about actors and their roles, which might imply certain competencies.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role
WHERE {
  ?participation a actorODP:CollaborationParticipation .
  ?participation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  ?participation actorODP:participantRole ?role .
}
```
