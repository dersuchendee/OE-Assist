**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct connection between a person and the instruments they play. The ontology defines a `playsInstrument` property, but it is not connected to any specific individuals or instances of instruments. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract information about people and instruments:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}
```
