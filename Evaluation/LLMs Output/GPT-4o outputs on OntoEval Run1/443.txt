The competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query the members of a band and their membership time intervals.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX time: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#>

SELECT ?band ?bandLabel ?musician ?musicianName ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  ?band a :Band .
  OPTIONAL { ?band rdfs:label ?bandLabel . }

  ?musician a :Musician .
  ?musician :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipInBand ?band .
  ?membership :membershipTime ?membershipTime .

  OPTIONAL { ?musician :hasName ?musicianName . }
}
ORDER BY ?band ?membershipTime
```

This query retrieves the band, its members, and the time intervals during which the musicians were members of the band.
