**Yes**

The competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about band memberships and the time intervals during which these memberships are valid. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?band ?bandLabel ?beginDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a ns1:Person ;
          rdfs:label ?personLabel ;
          ns1:hasMembership ?membership .

  ?membership ns1:membershipInBand ?band ;
              ns1:memberDuring ?interval .

  ?band rdfs:label ?bandLabel .

  ?interval ns1:hasBeginDate ?beginDate ;
            ns1:hasEndDate ?endDate .
}
ORDER BY ?band ?beginDate
```

This query retrieves the members of bands along with the time intervals during which they were members, allowing us to determine the members of a band at a specific point in time.
