**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific lineup of a band with a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for bands, musicians, lineups, and time periods, but it lacks the necessary structure to directly query for the members of a band at a specific point in time. The ontology would need additional properties or classes to represent the temporal aspect of band lineups.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?lineup ?musician
WHERE {
  ?band a :Band .
  ?lineup a :LineUp .
  ?lineup :partOfBand ?band .
  ?lineup :hasMember ?musician .
}
```
