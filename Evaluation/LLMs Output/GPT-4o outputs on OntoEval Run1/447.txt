**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the members of a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to band membership, roles, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements that would allow for querying the members of a band at a specific time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?artist ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership .
  ?membership :membership_band ?band .
  ?membership :membership_artist ?artist .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membership_startDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membership_endDate ?endDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves the band, artist, and the start and end dates of their membership, but it does not directly answer the competency question regarding the members at a specific point in time.
