**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the members of a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes information about band memberships and time intervals, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements that would allow for querying the members of a band at a specific time.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the band memberships and their associated time intervals:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?bandName ?member ?memberName ?role ?roleName ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :BandMembership ;
              :hasBand ?band ;
              :involvesMember ?member ;
              :hasRole ?role ;
              :hasTimeInterval ?timeInterval .

  ?band :bandName ?bandName .
  ?member :personName ?memberName .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
  ?timeInterval :startDate ?startDate ;
                :endDate ?endDate .
}
ORDER BY ?band ?startDate
```

This query retrieves the band memberships, including the band, member, role, and time interval, but it does not filter for a specific point in time. To fully answer the competency question, additional logic would be needed to filter memberships based on a given date.
