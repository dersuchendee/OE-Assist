**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to the concept of a "band" or "members of a band" at a specific point in time. The ontology primarily focuses on music albums, tracks, and related concepts, but lacks the necessary structure to represent band membership over time.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on musicians and bands, but it won't provide the temporal aspect of band membership:

```sparql
SELECT ?musician ?band
WHERE {
  ?musician a :Cl_Musician .
  ?band a :Cl_Band .
  ?musician :memberOf ?band .
}
```
