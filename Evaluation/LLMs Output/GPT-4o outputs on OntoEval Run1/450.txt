**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes for `Person`, `Role`, and `Band`, but it lacks a temporal component to capture the role of a person in a band at a specific time. The `hasRole` property connects a `Person` to a `Role`, but it does not include a temporal aspect.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists the roles of persons in bands without the temporal aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?role ?roleLabel
WHERE {
  ?person rdf:type ex:Person .
  ?person ex:hasName ?personName .
  ?person ex:hasRole ?role .
  ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel .
}
```
