**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the members of a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to band membership and time periods, but it lacks the necessary structure to directly associate a person with a band during a specific time period. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?person
WHERE {
  ?bandMembership a :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?bandMembership :hasMember ?band .
  ?bandMembership :memberOf ?person .
}
```
