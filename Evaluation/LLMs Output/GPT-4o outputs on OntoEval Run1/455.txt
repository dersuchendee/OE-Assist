**Yes**

The competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for band members and their membership times. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?member ?time
WHERE {
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_BandMembership ;
              :membershipInBand ?band ;
              :hasMember ?member ;
              :atTime ?time .
}
ORDER BY ?band ?time
```

This query retrieves the band, its members, and the time of their membership, which directly answers the competency question.
