**No**

The competency question asks for the members of a certain band at a certain point in time. The ontology provides information about band memberships and their start dates, but it does not include specific end dates for memberships or a way to query for the members at a specific point in time. Therefore, the ontology does not fully support the competency question.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_Membership .
  ?membership :memberOf ?band .
  ?membership :membershipStart ?startDate .
  ?person :bandMembership ?membership .
}
```
