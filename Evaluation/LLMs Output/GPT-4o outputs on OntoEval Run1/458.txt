**Yes**

The competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for band members and their membership times.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?member ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?membership :memberOf ?band .
  ?membership :hasMember ?member .
  ?membership :membershipTime ?membershipTime .
}
ORDER BY ?band ?membershipTime
```

This query retrieves the band, its members, and the time of their membership, which directly answers the competency question.
