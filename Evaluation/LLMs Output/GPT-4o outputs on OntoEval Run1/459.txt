**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate band members with a specific point in time. The ontology includes a `hasTimePeriod` property, but it is not used in a way that allows querying for band members at a specific point in time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists band members without considering the time aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?member
WHERE {
  ?band a :Cl_Band .
  ?band :hasMember ?member .
}
```
