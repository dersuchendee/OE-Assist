**No**

The ontology does not directly link actors to competencies without going through the Cl_ActorCompetency class. Therefore, a direct query to find actors with competencies is not possible. However, we can extract a partial answer by identifying actors and their associated Cl_ActorCompetency instances.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?competency
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :actorHasCompetency ?actorCompetency .
  ?actorCompetency :competencyOfActor ?competency .
}
```
