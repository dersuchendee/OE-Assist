The competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for band memberships and their associated time periods.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?member ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership .
  ?membership :membershipBand ?band .
  ?membership :membershipPerson ?member .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate . }
}
ORDER BY ?band ?startDate
```

This query retrieves the members of each band along with the start and end dates of their membership, allowing us to determine the members of a band at any given point in time.
