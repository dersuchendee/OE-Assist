**Yes**

The competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to track band membership over time, specifically through the `Cl_Membership` class and its associated properties like `membershipStart` and `membershipEnd`.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?start ?end
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership .
  ?membership :membershipIn ?band .
  ?membership :membershipStart ?start .
  ?membership :membershipEnd ?end .
  ?membership :hasRole ?role .
  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .
}
ORDER BY ?band ?start
```

This query retrieves the members of a band, their roles, and the time period of their membership, which aligns with the competency question.
