**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a band with its members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for bands, people, and memberships, but it lacks a mechanism to query the members of a band at a specific time. The ontology would need a temporal aspect to the membership or a way to query historical data to answer this competency question fully.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some information about band members:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?person
WHERE {
  ?person :memberOf ?band .
}
```

This query retrieves the current members of a band but does not account for the temporal aspect of membership.
