**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct or indirect relationships between bands and their members at specific points in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to band membership, roles, and time periods, but it lacks the necessary connections to answer the competency question directly. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?member
WHERE {
  ?band a :Cl_Band .
  ?member a :Cl_Person .
  ?member :isMemberOfBand ?membership .
  ?band :hasMember ?membership .
}
```

This query retrieves bands and their members, but it does not include the time aspect required to fully answer the competency question.
