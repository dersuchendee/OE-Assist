**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a role in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes for `Cl_Person`, `Cl_Band`, `Cl_Role`, and `Cl_BandMembership`, but the properties do not directly connect these elements in a way that allows for querying the role of a person in a band at a specific time.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?membership :membershipOfPerson ?person .
  ?membership :membershipInBand ?band .
  ?membership :playsRole ?role .
}
```
