**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes for `Person`, `Role`, and `Band`, and properties like `hasRole`, but it lacks a temporal component to specify when a person held a particular role in a band. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?role ?band
WHERE {
  ?person a ex:Person ;
          ex:hasName ?personName ;
          ex:hasRole ?role .
  ?band a ex:Band ;
         ex:hasMember ?person .
}
```
