**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the role of a person in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to bands, musicians, and their memberships, but it lacks a temporal component to capture the role of a person in a band at a specific time.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists the roles of persons in bands without considering the time aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?band ?bandName ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :hasName ?personName ;
          :memberOf ?membership .

  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership ;
              :hasMembership ?band ;
              :hasRole ?role .

  ?band a :Cl_MusicalGroup ;
        :hasName ?bandName .
}
```
