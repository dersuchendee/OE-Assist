**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a role in a band at a specific point in time. While the ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, bands, roles, and time intervals, it lacks a mechanism to link these elements together in a way that answers the competency question. Specifically, the ontology does not have a class or property that represents the concept of a person playing a role in a band during a specific time interval.

However, we can extract partial information about the roles of persons in bands without the time aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?band ?bandName ?role ?roleName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person ;
          :personName ?personName ;
          :isMemberOf ?band ;
          :hasRole ?role .
  ?band a :Band ;
        :bandName ?bandName .
  ?role a :Role ;
        :roleName ?roleName .
}
```
