**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the role of a person in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to musicians, bands, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and the time period within a band. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?band .
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
}
```
