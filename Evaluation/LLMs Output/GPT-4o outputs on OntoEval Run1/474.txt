**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes that directly relate to roles or time periods within a band. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying band memberships, but without specific roles or time periods.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOfBand ?bandMembership .
  ?bandMembership :bandMember ?band .
}
```
