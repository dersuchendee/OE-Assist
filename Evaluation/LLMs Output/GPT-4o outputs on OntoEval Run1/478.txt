**Yes**

The competency question "What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query the role of a person in a band at a specific time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?time
WHERE {
  ?bandRole rdf:type :Cl_BandRole ;
            :roleOfPerson ?person ;
            :roleInBand ?band ;
            :hasRole ?role ;
            :roleAtTime ?time .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, band, role, and time from the ontology, which directly answers the competency question.
