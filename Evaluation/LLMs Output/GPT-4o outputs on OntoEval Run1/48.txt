**No**

The ontology does not directly provide a way to extract the actors involved in a circular value network (CVN). The ontology defines classes and properties related to actors, roles, and participations, but it does not explicitly connect these to a CVN instance. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only provide a partial answer by listing actors and their roles without associating them with a specific CVN.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role
WHERE {
  ?participation a actor:CVNParticipation .
  ?participation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  ?participation actorODP:participantRole ?role .
}
```
