**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for people, bands, roles, and membership times, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and the time they held that role within a band. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role
WHERE {
  ?bandRole a :Cl_BandRole ;
            :roleOf ?person ;
            :roleInBand ?band ;
            :hasRole ?role .
}
```
