**No**

The competency question asks for the role of a certain person in a certain band at a certain point in time. The ontology provides information about band membership and roles, but it does not explicitly connect roles to specific points in time. Therefore, the CQ cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?band
WHERE {
  ?personRole rdf:type :Cl_PersonRole ;
              :hasRole ?role ;
              :roleOf ?person ;
              :roleInBand ?band .
}
```
