**Yes**

The competency question "What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query the role of a person in a band at a specific time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?band ?time
WHERE {
  ?roleInstance a :Cl_PersonRoleBandTime ;
                :hasPerson ?person ;
                :hasRole ?role ;
                :hasBand ?band ;
                :hasTime ?time .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, their role, the band they are part of, and the time period associated with that role, which directly answers the competency question.
