The competency question "What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query the role of a person in a band during a specific membership period. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership .
  ?membership :membershipPerson ?person .
  ?membership :membershipBand ?band .
  ?membership :hasRole ?roleEntity .
  ?roleEntity :roleName ?role .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves the person, band, role, and the start and end dates of the membership, which together answer the competency question.
