**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes that directly relate to the role of a person in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for persons, bands, memberships, roles, and time periods, but it does not explicitly connect these elements in a way that would allow us to query for a person's role in a band at a specific time.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list the memberships and roles of persons in bands, but without the specific time context:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipInBand ?band .
  ?membership :hasRole ?roleEntity .
  ?roleEntity :roleName ?role .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, band, and role, but it does not include the specific point in time, as the ontology does not support this level of detail.
