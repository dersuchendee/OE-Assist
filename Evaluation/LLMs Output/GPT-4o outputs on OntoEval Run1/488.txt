**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes that directly relate to a person's role in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to band membership, roles, and time periods, but there is no direct connection between these elements that would allow us to query for a person's role in a band at a specific time.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list persons and their roles in bands, but without the time component:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasRoleInBand ?bandRole .
  ?bandRole :playsRole ?role .
  ?bandRole :roleDuring ?timePeriod .
  ?band :hasMember ?bandRole .
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve persons, their roles, and the bands they are associated with, but it does not include a specific point in time due to the lack of a direct connection in the ontology.
