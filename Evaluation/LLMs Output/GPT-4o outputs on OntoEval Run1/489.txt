**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between the album and its recording period. The `Cl_AlbumRecording` class is not directly linked to the `Cl_Album` class or its instances. Therefore, we cannot directly query the recording period of a specific album using the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?album ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?recording a :Cl_AlbumRecording .
  OPTIONAL { ?recording :dp_recordingStartDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?recording :dp_recordingEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```
