The competency question "What are the actors involved in this circular value network?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that define actors and their involvement in circular value networks. The SPARQL query below retrieves the actors involved in each circular value network:

```sparql
SELECT ?circularValueNetwork ?actor
WHERE {
  ?circularValueNetwork a :Cl_CircularValueNetwork .
  ?circularValueNetwork :op_hasActor ?actor .
}
```

This query selects circular value networks and their associated actors, effectively answering the competency question.
