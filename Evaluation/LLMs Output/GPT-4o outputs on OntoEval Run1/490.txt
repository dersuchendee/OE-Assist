The competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to determine the recording period of an album. Specifically, the `:Album` class is linked to the `:RecordingSession` class through the `:recordedDuring` property, and the `:RecordingSession` class has `:hasStartDate` and `:hasEndDate` properties to specify the time period.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  ?album :recordedDuring ?recordingSession .
  ?recordingSession :hasStartDate ?startDate .
  ?recordingSession :hasEndDate ?endDate .
}
```
