**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the time period during which an album was recorded. It only provides information about the release date of an album. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted regarding the release date of the album.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album .
  ?album :hasRelease ?release .
  ?release :hasReleaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```
