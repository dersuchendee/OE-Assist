**No**

The ontology does not provide explicit information about the time period during which an album was recorded. However, we can extract partial information about the album and its release date.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumTitle ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album .
  ?album :albumTitle ?albumTitle .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```
