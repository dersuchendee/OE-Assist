**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the time period during which a specific album was recorded. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums, tracks, and recording periods, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific album and its recording time period. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?recordingPeriod
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :recordedDuring ?albumRecording .
  ?albumRecording :recordingPeriod ?recordingPeriod .
}
```

This query retrieves albums and their associated recording periods, but it does not specify the exact time period for a specific album, as the ontology does not provide a direct link between an album and its recording time period.
