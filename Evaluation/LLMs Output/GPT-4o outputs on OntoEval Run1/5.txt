The competency question "Which is the type of a source?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `Source` class and the `hasType` property, which links a source to its type. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the type of each source.

```sparql
SELECT ?source ?type
WHERE {
  ?source a :Source .
  ?source :hasType ?type .
}
```
