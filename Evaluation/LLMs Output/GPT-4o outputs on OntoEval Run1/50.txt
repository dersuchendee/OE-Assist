The competency question "What are the actors involved in this circular value network?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines a `ValueNetwork` class and an `Actor` class, with the `hasActor` object property relating a value network to its actors. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the actors involved in a circular value network.

```sparql
SELECT ?valueNetwork ?actor
WHERE {
  ?valueNetwork a :ValueNetwork .
  ?valueNetwork :hasActor ?actor .
}
```
