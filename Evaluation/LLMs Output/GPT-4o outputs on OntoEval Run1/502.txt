The competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to determine the recording period of an album. Specifically, the `:recordedDuring` object property connects an album to a recording session, and the `:recordingStartDate` and `:recordingEndDate` data properties provide the start and end dates of the recording session.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the recording period of an album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?recordingStartDate ?recordingEndDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :recordedDuring ?recordingSession .
  ?recordingSession :recordingStartDate ?recordingStartDate .
  ?recordingSession :recordingEndDate ?recordingEndDate .
}
```
