**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the time period during which a specific album was recorded. The ontology includes properties related to albums, such as `albumRecordingStartDate` and `albumRecordingEndDate`, but it does not specify which album these dates correspond to. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for albums and their recording start and end dates, but it will not specify the album in question.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album :albumRecordingStartDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?album :albumRecordingEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```
