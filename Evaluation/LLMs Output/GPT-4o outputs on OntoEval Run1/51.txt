**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the relationship between processes and circular value networks, which is represented in the ontology through the `op_isUsedIn` and `op_partOfCVN` properties. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?process ?cvn
WHERE {
  ?processInCVN a :Cl_ProcessInCVN .
  ?processInCVN :op_isUsedIn ?process .
  ?processInCVN :op_partOfCVN ?cvn .
}
```
