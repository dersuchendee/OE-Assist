**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct properties or classes that relate to the recording time period of an album. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums, tracks, and songs, but there is no explicit connection to a time period for when an album was recorded. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information about albums:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
}
```
