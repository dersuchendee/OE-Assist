**No**

The ontology does not directly support querying the number of tracks in an album. The `hasTrackCount` property is associated with `Cl_AlbumTrackInfo`, but there is no direct connection between `Cl_MusicAlbum` and `Cl_AlbumTrackInfo` in the ontology. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the tracks associated with an album.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumName (COUNT(?track) AS ?trackCount)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
  ?album :hasName ?albumName .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album ?albumName
```
