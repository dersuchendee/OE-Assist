The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:trackCount` property, which specifies the number of tracks in a music album. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?trackCount
WHERE {
  ?album a :MusicAlbum .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  ?album :trackCount ?trackCount .
}
```
