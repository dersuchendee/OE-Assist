The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `ns1:numberOfTracks` property, which indicates the total number of tracks on an album. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?numberOfTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a ns1:Album .
  ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel .
  ?album ns1:numberOfTracks ?numberOfTracks .
}
```
