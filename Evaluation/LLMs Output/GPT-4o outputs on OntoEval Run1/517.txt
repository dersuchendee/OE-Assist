The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Album` and the object property `hasTrack` which connects an album to its tracks. We can write a SPARQL query to count the number of tracks for a specific album.

```sparql
SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album
```
