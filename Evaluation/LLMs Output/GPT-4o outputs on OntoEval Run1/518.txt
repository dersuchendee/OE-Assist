The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `Album` class with a `numberOfTracks` data property, which directly provides the number of tracks in an album. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the number of tracks for a specific album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumTitle ?numberOfTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album ;
         :albumTitle ?albumTitle ;
         :numberOfTracks ?numberOfTracks .
}
```
