The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate albums to tracks, specifically through the `:hasTrack` property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the number of tracks for each album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?trackCount)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album
```
