**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to count the number of tracks in an album. The property `:numberOfTracks` is associated with `:Cl_AlbumTrack`, but there is no direct connection to count the tracks for a specific album. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```
