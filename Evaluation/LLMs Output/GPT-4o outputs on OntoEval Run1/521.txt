**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct properties or classes that relate to albums or tracks. The ontology is focused on people, bands, instruments, roles, and performances, but it lacks the necessary structure to directly answer the competency question about the number of tracks in a particular album. However, we can attempt to extract a partial answer by querying for any related information about tracks or albums, if they were present.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```

This query attempts to find any albums and their associated tracks, but without specific properties or data related to track counts, it cannot fully answer the CQ.
