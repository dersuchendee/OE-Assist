**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to count the number of tracks in an album. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums and tracks, but it lacks a direct connection or property that specifies the number of tracks contained in an album. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTracks ?track .
}
```
