The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Album` and the object property `containsTrack`, which allows us to count the number of tracks associated with a specific album.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album
```
