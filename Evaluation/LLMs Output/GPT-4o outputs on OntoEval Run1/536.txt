The competency question "When was a certain album released?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a `:releaseDate` property for the `:MusicAlbum` class, which allows us to query the release date of a specific album.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :MusicAlbum .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```
