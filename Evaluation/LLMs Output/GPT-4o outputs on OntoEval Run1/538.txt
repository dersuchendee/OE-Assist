The competency question "When was a certain album released?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `ns1:Album` class and the `ns1:hasReleaseDate` property, which allows us to query for the release date of an album.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the release date of an album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a ns1:Album .
  ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel .
  ?album ns1:hasReleaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```
