The competency question "When was a certain album released?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about albums and their release dates, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the release date of a specific album.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album .
  ?album :hasRelease ?release .
  ?release :hasReleaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```
