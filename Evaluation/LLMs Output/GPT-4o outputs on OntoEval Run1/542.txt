**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct properties or classes related to the release date of an album. Therefore, the competency question "When was a certain album released?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying albums, but without their release dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
}
