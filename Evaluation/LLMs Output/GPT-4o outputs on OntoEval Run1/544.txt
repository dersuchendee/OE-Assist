**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any properties or classes that directly relate to the release date of an album. Therefore, the competency question "When was a certain album released?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to albums, but without the release date.

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
}
```
