The competency question "When was a certain album released?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums and their release dates, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the release date of a specific album.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the release date of an album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releasedOn ?albumRelease .
  ?albumRelease :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```
