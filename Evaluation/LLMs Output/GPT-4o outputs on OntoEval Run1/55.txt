**No**

The ontology does not directly support querying which materials a product consists of, as there is no direct relationship between `Cl_Product` and `Cl_Material`. The relationship is mediated through `Cl_ProductComposition`, but the competency question asks for a direct relationship. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?product ?material
WHERE {
  ?product a :Cl_Product .
  ?product :consistsOf ?composition .
  ?composition :hasMaterial ?material .
}
```
