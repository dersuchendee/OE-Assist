The ontology does not contain any information about albums or their release dates. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying albums, if they were present in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
}
```
