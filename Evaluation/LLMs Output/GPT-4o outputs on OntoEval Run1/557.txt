**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about albums or their release dates. However, it does contain classes and properties related to albums, such as `:Cl_Album`, `:Cl_AlbumRelease`, and `:releaseDate`. Therefore, a partial SPARQL query can be constructed to extract information about albums and their release dates, but it will not provide a complete answer to the competency question without additional data.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releasedOn ?release .
  ?release :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```
