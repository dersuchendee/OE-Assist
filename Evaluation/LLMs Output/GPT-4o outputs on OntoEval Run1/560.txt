The competency question "What song is a specific track a recording of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_TrackRecording` with the object property `op_isRecordingOf` that links a track recording to a musical work (song). This allows us to query which song a specific track is a recording of.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?trackRecording ?trackRecordingName ?musicalWork ?musicalWorkName
WHERE {
  ?trackRecording a :Cl_TrackRecording .
  ?trackRecording :op_isRecordingOf ?musicalWork .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?trackRecording rdfs:label ?trackRecordingName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?musicalWork rdfs:label ?musicalWorkName . }
}
```
