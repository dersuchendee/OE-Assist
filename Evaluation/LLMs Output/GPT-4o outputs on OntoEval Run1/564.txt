**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct relationship between a track and the song it is a recording of. The ontology defines classes for `Song`, `Track`, and `Album`, and it includes properties like `isRecordingOf` and `hasRecording`, but there is no explicit data or individuals that link a specific track to a song. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying tracks and their titles:

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?trackTitle
WHERE {
  ?track a :Track .
  ?track :trackTitle ?trackTitle .
}
```
