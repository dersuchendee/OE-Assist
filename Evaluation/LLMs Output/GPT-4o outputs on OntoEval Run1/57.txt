**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the composition of a material. The ontology is structured around products, components, and material compositions, but it does not directly link to the specific composition of a material itself. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer related to material compositions:

```sparql
SELECT ?materialComposition ?material ?property ?provenance
WHERE {
  ?materialComposition a :Cl_MaterialComposition .
  OPTIONAL { ?materialComposition :hasMaterial ?material . }
  OPTIONAL { ?materialComposition :hasProperty ?property . }
  OPTIONAL { ?materialComposition :hasProvenance ?provenance . }
}
```
