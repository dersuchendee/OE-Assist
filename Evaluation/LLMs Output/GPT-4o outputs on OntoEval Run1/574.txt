**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific track with the song it is a recording of. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums, tracks, and songs, but it lacks a direct relationship between a specific track and the song it is a recording of. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying tracks and songs, but not their specific association.

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
}
```
