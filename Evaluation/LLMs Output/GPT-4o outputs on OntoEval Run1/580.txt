The competency question "What song is a specific track a recording of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to connect a track to a song through the reification class `Cl_TrackRecording`. The `isRecordingOf` property links a `Cl_Track` to a `Cl_TrackRecording`, and the `recordedSong` property links a `Cl_TrackRecording` to a `Cl_Song`.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?trackRecording .
  ?trackRecording :recordedSong ?song .
}
```
