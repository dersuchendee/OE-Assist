The competency question "When was a certain song composed?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:composedOn` datatype property, which specifies the date a song was composed. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the composition date of a song:

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?songLabel ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  ?song :composedOn ?compositionDate .
}
```
