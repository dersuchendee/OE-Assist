The competency question "When was a certain song composed?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Composition` with a property `composition_date` that links to a `Cl_Song`. This allows us to query for the composition date of a song.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Cl_Composition .
  ?composition :composition_song ?song .
  ?composition :composition_date ?compositionDate .
}
```
