**No**

The ontology does not provide sufficient information to answer the competency question about the chemical composition of a material. The ontology defines a class for chemical composition and properties related to it, but it does not define a class or properties for materials themselves, nor does it provide any instances or data that would allow us to determine the chemical composition of a specific material.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?chemicalComposition ?element ?atomicPercentage
WHERE {
  ?chemicalComposition a :Cl_ChemicalComposition .
  OPTIONAL { ?chemicalComposition :hasElement ?element . }
  OPTIONAL { ?chemicalComposition :hasAtomicPercentage ?atomicPercentage . }
}
```
