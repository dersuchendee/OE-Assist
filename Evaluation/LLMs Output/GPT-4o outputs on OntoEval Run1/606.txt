The ontology does not contain any information about critics or their reviews of records. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about albums and their titles.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumTitle
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
  ?album :hasTitle ?albumTitle .
}
