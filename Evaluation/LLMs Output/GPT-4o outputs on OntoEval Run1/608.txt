The ontology does not contain any information about critics or reviews related to records. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about records and music tracks.

```sparql
SELECT ?record ?track
WHERE {
  ?record a :Record .
  ?record :containsTrack ?track .
}
