**Yes**

The competency question "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to critics, reviews, and albums, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the desired information.

```sparql
SELECT ?critic ?album ?reviewText
WHERE {
  ?critic a :Cl_Critic .
  ?critic :reviewsAlbum ?review .
  ?review :reviewedAlbum ?album .
  ?review :reviewText ?reviewText .
}
```

This query retrieves the critic, the album they reviewed, and the text of the review, which directly answers the competency question.
