The competency question "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to critics, reviews, and albums, which are necessary to extract the required information.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?critic ?album ?statement
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :reviewedBy ?review .
  ?review :madeBy ?critic .
  ?review :statement ?statement .
}
```

This query retrieves the critic, album, and the statement made by the critic about the album, which directly answers the competency question.
