The competency question "What are the actors involved in the process?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines a class `:Actor` and a class `:Process`, with an object property `:involvesActor` that relates a process to the actors involved in it. This allows us to query for actors involved in any given process.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?process ?actor
WHERE {
  ?process a :Process .
  ?process :involvesActor ?actor .
}
```
