**No**

The ontology provided does not include any classes or properties related to critics, reviews, or records. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SPARQL query to extract the answer to the competency question "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" based on the given ontology.

However, a partial SPARQL query could be written to extract information about albums and tracks, which are present in the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
```

This query retrieves albums and their associated tracks, but it does not address the competency question regarding critics and their reviews of records.
