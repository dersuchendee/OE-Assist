**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the date of a specific performance. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances, but it lacks specific instances or data properties that would allow us to extract the date of a particular performance directly. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list performances and their associated bands, but without specific dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?band
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedBy ?band .
}
```
