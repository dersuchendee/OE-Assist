The competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances and their dates, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the date of a performance.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performanceEvent a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?performanceEvent :hasPerformance ?performance .
  ?performanceEvent :hasDate ?date .
}
```
