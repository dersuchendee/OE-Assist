**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific performance took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances, bands, and locations, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific performance and its date. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on performances and their associated bands:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?band
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?band :performs ?performance .
}
```
