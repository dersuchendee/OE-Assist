**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific performance took place. However, we can extract partial information about performances and their dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?date .
}
```
