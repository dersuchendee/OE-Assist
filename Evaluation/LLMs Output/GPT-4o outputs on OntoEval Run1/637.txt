The competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances and their dates, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the performance dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :tookPlaceOn ?performanceDateEntity .
  ?performanceDateEntity :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```
