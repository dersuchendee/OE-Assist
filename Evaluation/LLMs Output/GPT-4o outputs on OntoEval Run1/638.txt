**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about specific performances or their dates. However, we can extract partial information about performances and their venues.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?venue
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedIn ?venue .
}
```
