**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about performances or their dates. However, we can extract partial information about performances and their locations.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :performanceLocation ?location . }
}
```
