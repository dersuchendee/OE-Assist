**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific performance took place. The ontology includes a `:performanceDate` property for the `:Cl_Performance` class, but there is no direct connection between a specific performance and its date in the provided data. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information about performances:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?band ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedIn ?band .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :performanceDate ?date . }
}
```
