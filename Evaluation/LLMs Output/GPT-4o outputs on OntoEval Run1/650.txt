**No**

The ontology does not directly support the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" because it lacks a direct connection between performances and songs played in them. However, it does have a reification class `Cl_PerformanceSong` that can be used to partially answer the question by connecting performances to songs through reification.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer using the reification approach:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceName ?song ?songName
WHERE {
  ?performanceSong a :Cl_PerformanceSong .
  ?performanceSong :performanceOf ?performance .
  ?performance :hasName ?performanceName .

  ?performanceSong :songPlayed ?song .
  ?song :hasName ?songName .
}
```
