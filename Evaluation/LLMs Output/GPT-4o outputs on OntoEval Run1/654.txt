**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about specific performances or the songs played during those performances. The ontology includes classes and properties related to bands, musicians, albums, music tracks, and performances, but it lacks the necessary connections to determine which songs were played in a specific performance.

A partial SPARQL query to extract available information about performances and their associated bands is as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?band
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  ?performance :hasPerformer ?band .
}
```

This query retrieves performances and the bands that performed, but it does not provide information about the specific songs played during those performances.
