**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate songs with specific performances. However, we can extract partial information about performances and tracks, but not the specific songs played in a performance.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?track
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
}
```
