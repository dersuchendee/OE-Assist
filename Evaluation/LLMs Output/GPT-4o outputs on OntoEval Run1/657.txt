**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct relationships or properties that connect performances to songs. The ontology includes classes and properties related to songs, albums, bands, musicians, and performances, but there is no explicit connection between a performance and the songs played during that performance. Therefore, the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists performances and their associated bands, but not the specific songs played:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?band
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?band :performs ?performance .
}
```
