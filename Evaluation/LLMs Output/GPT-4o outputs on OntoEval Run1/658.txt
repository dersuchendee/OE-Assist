**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate songs with a specific performance. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances and songs, but it lacks a direct connection between a performance and the songs played during that performance. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?song
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedSong ?performanceSong .
  ?performanceSong :songPerformed ?song .
}
```

This query retrieves performances and the songs associated with them, but it does not specify which songs were played in a certain performance, as the ontology does not provide a way to specify a particular performance.
