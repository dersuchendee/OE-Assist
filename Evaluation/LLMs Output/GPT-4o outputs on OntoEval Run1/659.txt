The ontology provided does not contain any properties or classes that directly relate to performances or songs played during performances. The closest related classes and properties are related to albums, tracks, and recordings, but there is no explicit connection to performances or the songs played in them.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on tracks and albums, which might indirectly relate to performances:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
