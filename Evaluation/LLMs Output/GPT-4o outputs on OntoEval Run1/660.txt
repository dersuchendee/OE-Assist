**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct classes or properties that relate to performances or songs played in performances. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying tracks and songs, but not their association with specific performances.

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?recording .
  ?recording :hasRecording ?song .
}
```
