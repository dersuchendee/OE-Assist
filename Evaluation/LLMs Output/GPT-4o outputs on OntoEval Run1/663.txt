**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate songs with specific performances. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances, setlists, and songs, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific performance and the songs played during that performance. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the songs included in a performance setlist, but it does not specify which performance the setlist belongs to.

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?songTitle
WHERE {
  ?setlist a :Cl_PerformanceSetlist .
  ?setlist :includesSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songTitle . }
}
```
