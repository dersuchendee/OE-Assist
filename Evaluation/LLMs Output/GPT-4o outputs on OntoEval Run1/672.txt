**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to performances or songs played during performances. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to performances, but it will not include the songs played.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?performance :performedOn ?performanceDate .
  }
}
```
