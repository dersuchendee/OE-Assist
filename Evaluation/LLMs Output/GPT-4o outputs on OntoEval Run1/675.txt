**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a performance. The ontology includes classes and properties related to musical groups, albums, tracks, and performances, but it lacks a property that directly associates a performance with a location. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information about performances:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?performance :hasPerformanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```
