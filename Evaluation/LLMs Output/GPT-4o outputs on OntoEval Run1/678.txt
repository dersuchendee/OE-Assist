**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link a performance to a specific location. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances and locations, but there is no explicit connection between a performance event and a geographical location. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?performance :hasDate ?date .
}
```
