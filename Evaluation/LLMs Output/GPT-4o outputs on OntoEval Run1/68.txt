**No**

The ontology does not provide specific properties or classes that directly relate to the detailed information about a resource, such as its specific attributes or characteristics beyond its type, composition, and usage in process steps. Therefore, a complete answer to the competency question cannot be extracted. However, a partial answer can be obtained by querying the available information about resources, such as their type and composition.

```sparql
SELECT ?resource ?type ?composition
WHERE {
  ?resource a :Resource .
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :hasType ?type . }
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :hasComposition ?composition . }
}
```
