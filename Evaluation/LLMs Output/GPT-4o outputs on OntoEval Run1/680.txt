**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to performances or locations where performances take place. Therefore, the competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying performances, but without location information.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
}
```
