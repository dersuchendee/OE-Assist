**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the location of performances, such as venues or cities, which is necessary to answer the competency question about where a certain performance took place. However, we can extract partial information about performances.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```
