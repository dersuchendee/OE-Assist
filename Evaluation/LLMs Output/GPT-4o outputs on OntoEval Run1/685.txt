**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a specific performance. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances and locations, but it does not explicitly link a performance to a specific location. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?city
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedIn ?city .
}
```
