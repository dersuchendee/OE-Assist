**No**

The competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" is not fully supported by the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to music, bands, albums, and performances, but it does not include any information about cities or regions. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only provide a partial answer, as there is no data about cities or regions in the ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would return no results due to the lack of relevant data in the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :op_isLocatedIn ?region .
}
```
