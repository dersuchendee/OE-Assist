**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the composition of a specific resource. The ontology defines classes and properties related to resources, products, components, materials, and compositions, but it lacks specific instances or data that would allow us to query the composition of a specific resource. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?resource ?composition
WHERE {
  ?resource a :Resource .
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :hasComposition ?composition . }
}
```
