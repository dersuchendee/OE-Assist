**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about cities or their regions. Therefore, the competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted if there were any cities and their relationships to regions in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :City .
  ?city :isPartOf ?region .
  ?region a :Region .
}
```
