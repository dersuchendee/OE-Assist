**No**

The competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" is not fully supported by the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to geographical locations, cities, and regions, but it does not provide a direct way to query the region of a specific city. The ontology defines the `:isLocatedIn` property for cities and regions, but it lacks instances or data to perform a complete query.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, assuming that instances of cities and regions were available:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?region .
}
```

This query would return the cities and their corresponding regions if instances were present in the ontology. However, without specific instances, the query cannot provide a complete answer.
