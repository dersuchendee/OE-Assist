**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the region in which a city is located. However, we can extract partial information about cities and regions.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?city :cityRegion ?cityRegion .
    ?cityRegion :regionOfCity ?region .
  }
}
```
