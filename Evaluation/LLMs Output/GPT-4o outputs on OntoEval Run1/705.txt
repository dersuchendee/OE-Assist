**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any properties or classes that directly relate to geographic locations of cities or regions. Therefore, the competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying cities, but without their corresponding regions.

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
}
```
