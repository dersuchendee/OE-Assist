**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and a region, which is necessary to answer the competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" However, we can extract partial information about the regions and countries.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?region .
}
```
