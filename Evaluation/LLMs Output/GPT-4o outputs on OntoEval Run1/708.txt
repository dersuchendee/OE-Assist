**No**

The competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" is not fully supported by the ontology. The ontology provides information about cities and their regions, but it does not provide a direct way to query for a specific city and its corresponding region. However, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the city-region relationship.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?region .
}
```
