**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the geographic location of cities, which is necessary to answer the competency question about the region in which a certain city is located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances, songs, and albums, but it lacks the necessary geographic information.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
}
```
