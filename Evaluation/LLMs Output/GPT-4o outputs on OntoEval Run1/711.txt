**Yes**

The competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for cities and regions, and there is a property `:locatedIn` that connects a city to a region. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityName ?region ?regionName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City ;
        :locationName ?cityName ;
        :locatedIn ?region .
  ?region :locationName ?regionName .
}
```
