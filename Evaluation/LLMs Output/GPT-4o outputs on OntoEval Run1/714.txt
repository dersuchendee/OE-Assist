**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the region in which a city is located. However, we can extract partial information about cities and their potential regions if such data were available.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :locatedIn ?region . }
}
```
