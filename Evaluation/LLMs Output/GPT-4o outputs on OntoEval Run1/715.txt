**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the geographic location of a city, only that a city is located in a region. Therefore, we cannot directly answer the competency question about the region of a certain city. However, we can extract partial information about cities and their regions.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?region .
}
```
