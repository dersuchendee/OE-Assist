**Yes**

The competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for `Cl_City` and `Cl_Region`, and an object property `locatedInRegion` that connects a city to a region. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedInRegion ?region .
}
```
