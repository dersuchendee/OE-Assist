**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a region and a country. The `locatedIn` property is defined, but it is not used in the ontology data. Therefore, we cannot directly answer the competency question using the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Region .
  OPTIONAL { ?region :locatedIn ?country . }
}
```
