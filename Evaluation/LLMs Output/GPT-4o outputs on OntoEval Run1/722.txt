**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a region and the country it is located in. However, it does provide a connection between a city and the region it is located in, and between a region and the country it is part of. Therefore, we can extract a partial answer by querying the regions and their corresponding countries.

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a ns1:Region .
  ?region ns1:isPartOf ?country .
}
```
