**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about countries or regions, which is necessary to answer the competency question "In what country is a certain region located?". However, we can extract partial information about regions and their parts.

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?part
WHERE {
  ?region a :Region .
  ?region :hasPart ?part .
}
```
