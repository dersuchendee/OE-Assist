**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about regions or their corresponding countries. Therefore, the competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying regions, but without their corresponding countries.

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?regionName
WHERE {
  ?region a :Region .
  ?region :placeName ?regionName .
}
```
