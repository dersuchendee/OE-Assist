**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any properties or classes that directly relate to regions or countries. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to regions, but it will not include any country information.

```sparql
SELECT ?region
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
}
```
