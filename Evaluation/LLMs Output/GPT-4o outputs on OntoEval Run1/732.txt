The competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate regions to countries through the `:isPartOf` property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  ?region :isPartOf ?country .
  ?country a :Cl_Country .
}
```
