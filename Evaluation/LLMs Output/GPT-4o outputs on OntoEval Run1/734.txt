The competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate regions to countries, specifically through the `:regionInCountry` object property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?regionName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?region rdf:type :Cl_Region .
  ?region :locationName ?regionName .
  ?region :regionInCountry ?country .
  ?country :locationName ?countryName .
}
```
