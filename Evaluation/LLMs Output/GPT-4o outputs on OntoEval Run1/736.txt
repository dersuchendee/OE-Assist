**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the country in which a region is located. The ontology includes classes and properties for cities, regions, and countries, but it lacks a direct property that connects a region to a country. The closest available property is `regionInCountry`, which connects a region to a country, but without specific instances or data, we cannot extract a complete answer.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?region :regionInCountry ?country .
  }
}
```
