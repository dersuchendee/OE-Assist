The competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the classes `Cl_Region` and `Cl_Country`, and the object property `regionInCountry` which connects a region to a country. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  ?region :regionInCountry ?country .
}
```
