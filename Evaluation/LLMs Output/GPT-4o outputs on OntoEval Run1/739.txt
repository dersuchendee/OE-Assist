**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about regions or countries, nor does it have any properties that relate regions to countries. Therefore, the competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial query can be constructed to list regions, but it will not provide the country information.

```sparql
SELECT ?region
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
}
```
