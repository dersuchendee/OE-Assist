**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a region with a country. The ontology includes classes for `Cl_Region` and `Cl_Country`, and an object property `locatedInCountry` that connects a region to a country. However, there is no direct connection from a region to a country in the provided data. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract regions and their associated countries if any data were available:

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?region :locatedInCountry ?country .
  }
}
```
