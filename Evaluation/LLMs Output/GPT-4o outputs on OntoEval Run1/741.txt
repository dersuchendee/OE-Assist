**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct or indirect relationships between regions and countries. Therefore, the competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information about regions, but without the country association.

```sparql
SELECT ?region
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
}
```
