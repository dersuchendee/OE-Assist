**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a reification class `Cl_RecordContainsTrack` that connects an album to a track, ensuring that an album always contains at least one track. This is modeled through the `containsTrack` and `trackContained` object properties.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that every album contains at least one track:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumTitle ?track ?trackTitle
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
  ?album :containsTrack ?recordContainsTrack .
  ?recordContainsTrack :trackContained ?track .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?album :hasTitle ?albumTitle . }
  OPTIONAL { ?track :hasTitle ?trackTitle . }
}
```
