**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to music, albums, tracks, or recordings. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SPARQL query to answer the competency question "A record always contains at least one track" based on the given ontology.

However, a partial query to extract any information related to collections or compositions (which might be analogous to albums or records) could be:

```sparql
SELECT ?collection ?composition
WHERE {
  ?collection a :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  ?collection :op_composedOf ?composition .
}
```

This query attempts to find any collections and their compositions, but it does not directly address the concept of a "track" within a "record" as the ontology lacks the necessary structure to represent these concepts.
