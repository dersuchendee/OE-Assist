**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to music, albums, tracks, or recordings. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question regarding whether a record always contains at least one track. However, we can attempt to extract a partial answer by querying for any existing classes or properties that might be related to collections or items within collections, which could be analogous to records and tracks.

```sparql
SELECT ?collection ?item
WHERE {
  ?collection a ns1:ArticleCollection .
  ?collection ns1:hasArticle ?item .
}
```

This query attempts to find any collections and their constituent items, which could be conceptually similar to records and tracks, but it does not directly address the competency question about music records and tracks.
