**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to music, albums, tracks, or recordings. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SPARQL query to answer the competency question about records and tracks. However, a partial query could be written to extract information about publications, which is the closest related concept in the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?title
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  OPTIONAL { ?publication :title ?title . }
}
```
