**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the class `Cl_Album` that specifies it must contain at least one `Cl_Track`. This is represented by the `owl:someValuesFrom` restriction on the `:containsTrack` property.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that every album contains at least one track:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```

This query will return all albums that contain at least one track, confirming that the ontology supports the competency question.
