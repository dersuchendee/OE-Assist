**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Album` with a restriction that specifies it must have at least one `containsTrack` relationship, which aligns with the competency question.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that every album contains at least one track:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?album :containsTrack ?track .
  }
}
```

This query will return any albums that do not contain at least one track, which should be empty if the ontology correctly enforces the restriction.
