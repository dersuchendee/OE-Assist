**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology defines the class `Cl_Album` with an equivalent class restriction that ensures an album must contain at least one track (`owl:minCardinality 1` on the property `:containsTrack`). This aligns with the competency question that states a record (album) always contains at least one track.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify this:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```

This query retrieves all albums that contain at least one track, confirming the competency question is supported by the ontology.
