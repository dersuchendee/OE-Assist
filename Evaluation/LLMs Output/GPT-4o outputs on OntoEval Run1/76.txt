**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the specific dates when a theatre festival took place. The ontology includes a `startDate` property for `TheatreFestival`, but it does not specify an end date or a specific time interval for the festival. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a ns1:TheatreFestival .
  ?festival ns1:startDate ?startDate .
}
```
