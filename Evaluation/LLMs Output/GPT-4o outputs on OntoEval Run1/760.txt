**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Album` and the object property `containsTrack`, which indicates that an album contains tracks. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to check if every album contains at least one track.

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?album :containsTrack ?track .
  }
}
```

This query will return any albums that do not contain any tracks, which should be an empty result set if every album contains at least one track, thus confirming the competency question.
