**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology defines a class `Cl_Album` and a class `Cl_Track`, with an object property `hasTrack` that connects an album to its tracks. The ontology also includes a restriction on the `Cl_Album` class, specifying that an album must have at least one track (`owl:minCardinality "1"`). This aligns with the competency question.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that every album has at least one track:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?album :hasTrack ?track .
  }
}
```

This query will return any albums that do not have at least one track, which should be empty if the ontology correctly enforces the restriction.
