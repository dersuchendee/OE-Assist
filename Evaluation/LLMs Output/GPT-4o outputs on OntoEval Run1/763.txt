**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Cl_Album` class that ensures it must have at least one `Cl_Track` through the `containsTrack` property. This can be verified with the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```

This query will return all albums that contain at least one track, confirming that the ontology enforces the requirement that every album must have at least one track.
