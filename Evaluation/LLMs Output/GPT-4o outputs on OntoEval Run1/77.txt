**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the specific dates of theatre festivals. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, productions, and events, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific festival and its occurrence date. The ontology does have a `hasStartDate` and `hasEndDate` property for `TheatreFestival`, but these are not directly linked to the specific festival instances in the data provided.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a theatre:TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival theatre:hasStartDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?festival theatre:hasEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```
