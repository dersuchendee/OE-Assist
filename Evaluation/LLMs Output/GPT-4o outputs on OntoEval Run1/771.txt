**No**

The ontology provided does not include any direct representation of a "medical degree" or a specific connection between a person and their medical degrees. The ontology does have classes and properties related to degrees and fields of study, but it lacks the specific details needed to answer the competency question directly. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer based on the available ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeName ?degreeDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :hasDegree ?degree .
  ?degree a :MedicalDegree .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeName ?degreeName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeDate ?degreeDate . }
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve information about medical degrees associated with persons, but it relies on the assumption that such data exists in the ontology, which is not explicitly modeled in the provided ontology.
