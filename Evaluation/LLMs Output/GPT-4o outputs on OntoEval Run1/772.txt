**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with their medical degrees. The ontology includes classes for `Cl_Person`, `Cl_MedicalDegree`, and `Cl_PersonMedicalDegree`, but there is no direct object property linking a person to their medical degrees. The ontology does not support the competency question as it stands.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
}
```

This query attempts to find any person and their associated medical degrees, but it relies on the assumption that such a relationship exists in the ontology, which is not explicitly defined.
