**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for specific medical degrees associated with a person. The ontology includes a class for medical degrees and a reification class for person degrees, but it lacks a direct property or connection to retrieve specific medical degrees for a person. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degreeTitle
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasDegree ?personDegree .
  ?personDegree :degreeType ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle .
}
```
