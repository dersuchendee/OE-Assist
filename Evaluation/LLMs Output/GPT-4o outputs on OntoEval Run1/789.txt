**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as it includes the necessary classes and properties to represent the relationship between a person, their study period, and the degree obtained. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :studiedDuring ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :degreeObtained ?degree .
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :hasStartDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :hasEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```
