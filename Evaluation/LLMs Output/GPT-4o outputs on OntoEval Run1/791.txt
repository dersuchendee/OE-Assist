**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the start date of the study period for a specific degree. The ontology includes the end date of the study period for the Certified Nurse Degree, but the start date is not specified. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a ns1:Person .
  ?person ns1:hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod ns1:studiesFor ?degree .
  ?studyPeriod ns1:hasEndDate ?endDate .
}
```
