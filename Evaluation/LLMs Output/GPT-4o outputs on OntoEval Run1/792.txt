**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to relate a person to the specific degree they studied for and the time period during which they studied. The ontology includes classes and properties related to study periods and degrees, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the specific study period for a degree. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyPeriod ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :studiesFor ?degree .
  ?degree :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :hasStartDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :hasEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```
