**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific degree and the time period during which they studied for that degree. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, degrees, and study events, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements to answer the competency question.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?degree a :Cl_MedicalDegree .
  ?studyEvent a :Cl_StudyEvent .
  ?person :participatedInStudyEvent ?studyEvent .
  ?degree :isDegreeOfStudyEvent ?studyEvent .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?timePeriod a :Cl_TimePeriod .
    ?timePeriod :isPeriodOfStudyEvent ?studyEvent .
    ?timePeriod :hasStartDate ?startDate .
    ?timePeriod :hasEndDate ?endDate .
  }
}
```

This query attempts to gather information about persons, degrees, and associated study events, but it may not fully answer the competency question due to the lack of explicit connections in the ontology.
