**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific degree and the time period during which they studied for that degree. The ontology includes classes and properties related to degrees, fields of study, and study events, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the time interval of their study for a specific degree.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeName ?degreeDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :hasDegree ?degree .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeName ?degreeName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeDate ?degreeDate . }
}
