**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific degree and the time period during which they studied for that degree. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, study periods, and degrees, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, a specific degree, and the corresponding study period.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?studyPeriod ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :studiedFor ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :degree ?degree .
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :studyStartDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :studyEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```
