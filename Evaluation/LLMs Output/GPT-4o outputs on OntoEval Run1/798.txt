**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link a person to the specific degree they studied for and the time period of study. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, medical degrees, and study periods, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the specific degree they studied for, along with the time period.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyPeriod
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :studiedFor ?study .
  ?study a :Cl_PersonDegreeStudy .
  ?study :studyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
}
```

This query retrieves the study periods associated with persons, but it does not directly link them to specific degrees.
