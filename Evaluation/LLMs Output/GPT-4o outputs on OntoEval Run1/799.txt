**No**

The ontology does not provide explicit information about the start date of the study period for a specific degree. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question. However, we can extract partial information about the end date of the study period for a specific degree.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeTitle ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle .
  ?degree :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
}
