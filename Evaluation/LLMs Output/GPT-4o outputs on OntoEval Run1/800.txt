The competency question "During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate a person to a medical degree and the study period associated with that degree. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeTitle ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree a :Cl_MedicalDegree ;
          :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle .
  ?degree :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod a :Cl_StudyPeriod ;
               :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate ;
               :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, the degree they studied for, the title of the degree, and the start and end dates of the study period.
