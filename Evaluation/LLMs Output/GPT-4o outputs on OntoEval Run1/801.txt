**No**

The ontology does not provide explicit information about the study period for a specific degree. The ontology includes a `Cl_StudyPeriod` class and properties like `studyStartDate` and `studyEndDate`, but the start date for the study period is marked as "UNKNOWN". Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeTitle ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle .
  ?degree :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate .
  ?studyPeriod :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
}
```
