**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific degree and the time period during which they studied for that degree. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, medical degrees, and study periods, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and a specific degree with associated study periods.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyPeriod ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?person :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :studyStartDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :studyEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves persons, their degrees, and any associated study periods with start and end dates, but it does not directly link a person to a specific degree with a defined study period.
