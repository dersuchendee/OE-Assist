**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific theatre festival took place. The ontology includes a `hasDate` property for `Cl_TheatreFestival`, but there is no instance data or specific festival mentioned in the ontology to query against. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for any available dates associated with theatre festivals, but it won't provide the specific festival date mentioned in the story.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasDate ?date .
}
```
