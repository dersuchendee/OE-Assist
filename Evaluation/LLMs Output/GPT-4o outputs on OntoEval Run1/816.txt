**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a person was first employed at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment events and hospitals, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and their employment start date at a specific hospital. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Employee .
  ?person :hasEmploymentEvent ?employmentEvent .
  ?employmentEvent :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  ?hospital :hasEmploymentEventAtHospital ?employmentEvent .
}
```
