**No**

The competency question "When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?" is not fully supported by the given ontology. The ontology provides information about employment, including the start date, but it does not directly link a person to a specific hospital through employment. The ontology has classes and properties related to employment, hospitals, and persons, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and a hospital through employment.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which retrieves the employment start date for a person, but it does not specify the hospital:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Employment .
  ?employment :hasEmployee ?person .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
}
```
