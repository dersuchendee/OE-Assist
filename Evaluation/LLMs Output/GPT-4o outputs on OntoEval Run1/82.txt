**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the dates of theatre festivals. The ontology includes a `date` property for `Cl_TheatreFestival`, but there is no instance data or specific festival information provided in the ontology to answer the competency question directly. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list any theatre festivals and their dates if such data were present:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :date ?date .
}
```
