**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the employment start date of a person at a hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, medical degrees, hospitals, and employment, but it lacks a direct connection or data property that specifies when a person was first employed at a hospital.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information related to employment:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :employee ?person .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
}
```
