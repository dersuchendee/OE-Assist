**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a certain person was first employed at a certain hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment, but it lacks specific data properties or object properties that directly link a person to the start date of their employment at a hospital.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?employment rdf:type :Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  ?person rdf:type :Cl_Person .
}
```

This query retrieves the employment start dates for persons employed at hospitals, but it does not directly answer the competency question regarding the first employment date for a specific person at a specific hospital.
