**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a person was first employed at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment, but it does not specify a way to query for the first employment date of a person at a hospital. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which retrieves employment start dates for persons at hospitals:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :hasEmployee ?person .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
}
ORDER BY ?person ?startDate
```

This query retrieves all employment start dates for persons at hospitals, but it does not specifically identify the first employment date for a person at a particular hospital.
