**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a person was first employed at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the start date of their employment at a specific hospital. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentHospital ?hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate . }
}
```
