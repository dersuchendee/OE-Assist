The competency question "In what city is a certain hospital located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `ns1:locatedIn` property, which associates a hospital with the city it is located in. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital a ns1:Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
  ?hospital ns1:locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}
```
