**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between hospitals and cities, which is necessary to answer the competency question about the location of a hospital. The ontology includes classes for hospitals and cities, but lacks an object property that directly relates a hospital to a city. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
}
```

This query retrieves hospitals, but does not provide information about their location in a city.
