**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the specific dates of theatre festivals. The ontology includes classes and properties related to festivals, cities, and occurrences, but it lacks a direct link between a specific festival and its occurrence date. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?occurrence ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_Festival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence a :Cl_FestivalOccurrence .
  OPTIONAL { ?occurrence :hasDate ?date . }
}
```

This query will return festivals and their occurrences, but the date information might not be complete or directly linked to the specific festival in question.
