**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a hospital with a specific city. The ontology includes classes and properties related to hospitals, locations, and cities, but there is no direct property linking a hospital to a city. The closest available information is the `locatedIn` property that links a hospital to a location, and the `inCity` property that links a location to a city. However, without specific instances or data, we cannot extract the city for a given hospital.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?location ?city
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?location .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?location :inCity ?city .
  }
}
```
