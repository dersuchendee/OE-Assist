**No**

The ontology does not contain any direct information about the city in which a hospital is located. The closest information available is the location of the hospital, but it does not specify the city. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the location of the hospital, but not the specific city.

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?location
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?location .
}
```
