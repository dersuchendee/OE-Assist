**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the city in which a hospital is located. However, we can extract partial information about hospitals.

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
}
```
