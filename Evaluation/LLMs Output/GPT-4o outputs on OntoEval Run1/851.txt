The competency question "In what city is a certain hospital located?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to determine the city in which a hospital is located. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?hospital rdf:type :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospitalLocation :locationOf ?hospital .
  ?hospitalLocation :locatedIn ?city .
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityName ?cityName .
}
```

This query retrieves the name of the city for each hospital by traversing the relationships defined in the ontology.
