The competency question "In what city is a certain hospital located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Hospital` and the object property `:isLocatedInCity`, which connects hospitals to cities. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the city in which a hospital is located.

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?city
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :isLocatedInCity ?city .
}
```
