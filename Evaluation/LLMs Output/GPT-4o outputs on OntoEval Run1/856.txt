**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a hospital with a specific city. The `locatedIn` property connects a hospital to a city, but there is no data property or class that directly represents the city of a hospital. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying hospitals and their associated cities.

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?city
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
}
```
