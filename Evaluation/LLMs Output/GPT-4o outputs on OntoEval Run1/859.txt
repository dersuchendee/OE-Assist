The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate cities to countries, specifically through the `op_isLocatedIn` object property which connects instances of `Cl_City` to instances of `Cl_Country`.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :op_isLocatedIn ?country .
}
```
