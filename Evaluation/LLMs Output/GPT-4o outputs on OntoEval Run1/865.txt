**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and a country. The ontology includes classes and properties related to locations, cities, and countries, but it lacks a direct property that connects a city to a country. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the city and its location.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedInCountry ?countryLocation .
  ?countryLocation :inCountry ?country .
}
```
