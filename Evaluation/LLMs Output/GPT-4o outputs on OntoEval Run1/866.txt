**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and the country it is located in. The ontology includes classes and properties related to locations, cities, and countries, but it lacks a direct property or path that connects a city to a country. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?city :locatedInCountry ?countryLocation .
    ?countryLocation :country ?country .
  }
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve the country for each city, but due to the lack of a direct connection in the ontology, it may not return complete results.
