The competency question "When did a certain theatre festival take place?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides information about theatre festivals, including their occurrences and dates. We can write a SPARQL query to extract the date of a specific theatre festival occurrence.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :hasFestivalOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :festivalDate ?date .
}
```
