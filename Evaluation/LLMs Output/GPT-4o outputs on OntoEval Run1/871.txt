The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate cities to countries, specifically through the `cityLocatedIn` property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel .
  ?city :cityLocatedIn ?country .
  ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel .
}
