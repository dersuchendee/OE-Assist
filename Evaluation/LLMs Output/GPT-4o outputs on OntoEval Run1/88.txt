The competency question "When did a certain theatre festival take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for the date of a theatre festival event. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festivalName ?eventDate
WHERE {
  ?festival rdf:type :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :festivalName ?festivalName ;
            :hasFestivalEvent ?event .
  ?event :hasDate ?date .
  ?date :eventDate ?eventDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the name of the theatre festival and the date it took place by navigating through the `:Cl_TheatreFestival`, `:Cl_FestivalEvent`, and `:Cl_FestivalDate` classes and their associated properties.
