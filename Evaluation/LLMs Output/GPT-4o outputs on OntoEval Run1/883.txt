**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate union members with a specific union at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and time intervals, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their union membership, and the specific time period of that membership. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?membershipPeriod
WHERE {
  ?person a ns1:Person .
  ?person ns1:memberOf ?unionMembership .
  ?unionMembership ns1:hasUnion ?union .
  ?unionMembership ns1:hasMembershipPeriod ?membershipPeriod .
}
```
