**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to relate union members to a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to unions and their members, but it lacks a temporal aspect to capture membership at a specific time. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying union members without considering the time aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?union ?member
WHERE {
  ?member a :UnionMember .
  ?member :memberOf ?union .
}
```
