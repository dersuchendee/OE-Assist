**No**

The ontology provided does not include any classes or properties related to union membership or the specific point in time for union membership. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying persons and unions, but without the temporal aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union
WHERE {
  ?membership a :UnionMembership .
  ?membership :hasMember ?person .
  ?membership :hasUnion ?union .
}
```
