**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes information about union memberships and their start dates, but it lacks explicit temporal data to determine membership at a specific point in time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information about union members:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?membership :unionMember ?person .
  ?membership :memberOfUnion ?union .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
}
```
