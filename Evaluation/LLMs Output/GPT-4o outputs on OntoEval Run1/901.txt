**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query union membership at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership, but it lacks a mechanism to filter or specify the time period for membership. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the current ontology structure.

Partial answer SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  ?unionMembership a :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?unionMembership :hasMember ?person .
  ?unionMembership :memberOf ?union .
  OPTIONAL { ?unionMembership :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?unionMembership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves union membership information, including the start and end dates, but it does not filter by a specific point in time.
