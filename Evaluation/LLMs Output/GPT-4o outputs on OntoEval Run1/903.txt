**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union roles and memberships, but it lacks a direct connection to time-specific information for these roles. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?unionGroup ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasRoleMembership ?roleMembership .
  ?roleMembership :roleMembershipIn ?unionGroup .
  ?roleMembership :roleOfMembership ?role .
}
```
