**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and the time period for that role within a union group.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?unionGroup ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasUnionRole ?role .
  ?person :memberOfUnionGroup ?unionGroup .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, their union group, and their role, but it does not include the time aspect due to the lack of temporal properties in the ontology.
