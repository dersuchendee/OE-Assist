**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model the concept of a "role" within a "union group" at a specific "point in time." While there are properties related to union membership and roles, the ontology lacks a direct representation of the temporal aspect of roles within union groups. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted, but it will not include the temporal component.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?union
WHERE {
  ?person a ns1:Person .
  ?person ns1:hasRole ?role .
  ?role ns1:roleInUnion ?union .
}
```
