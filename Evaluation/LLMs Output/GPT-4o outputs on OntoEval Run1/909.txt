**No**

The ontology provided does not include any classes or properties that directly relate to roles within union groups or specific time intervals for role assignments. The ontology does include classes and properties related to union memberships and time intervals, but it lacks the necessary connections to roles within union groups. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :UnionMembership .
  ?membership :hasMember ?person .
  ?membership :hasUnion ?union .
  ?membership :hasTimeInterval ?interval .
  ?interval :startDate ?startDate .
  ?interval :endDate ?endDate .
}
```

This query retrieves information about union memberships, including the person involved, the union, and the time interval of the membership, but it does not provide information about specific roles within the union.
