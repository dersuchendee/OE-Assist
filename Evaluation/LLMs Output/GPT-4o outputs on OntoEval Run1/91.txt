**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific theatre festival took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, occurrences, and dates, but it does not explicitly link a specific festival to its occurrence date. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for all festival occurrences and their dates, but it won't specify which festival took place on which date.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?occurrenceDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :occurrenceDate ?occurrenceDate .
}
```
