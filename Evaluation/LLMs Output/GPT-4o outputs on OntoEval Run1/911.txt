**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, unions, roles, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements to answer the competency question fully. However, we can extract partial information about union memberships and roles.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?roleStartDate ?roleEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?unionMembership .
  ?unionMembership :inUnion ?union .
  ?person :hasRole ?unionRole .
  ?unionRole :roleInUnion ?union .
  ?unionRole :roleName ?role .
  OPTIONAL { ?unionRole :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?unionRole :roleEndDate ?roleEndDate . }
}
```
