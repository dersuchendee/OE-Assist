**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks temporal information about when a person held a specific role within a union. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted without the temporal aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?role
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :unionMember ?person ;
              :memberOfUnion ?union ;
              :hasUnionRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
}
```
