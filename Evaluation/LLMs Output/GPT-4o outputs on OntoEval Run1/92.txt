**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to associate a theatre festival with a specific date. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, occurrences, and dates, but it does not explicitly link a specific festival to a specific date. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?occurrence ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :occurrenceDate ?date .
}
```

This query retrieves the festivals and their occurrences with dates, but it does not specify which festival took place on a certain date, as the ontology does not provide a direct link between a specific festival and a specific date.
