**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a temporal aspect to capture the role at a specific point in time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?roleTitle ?union
WHERE {
  ?role rdf:type :Cl_UnionRole .
  ?role :roleTitle ?roleTitle .
  ?role :hasRole ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipOf ?person .
  ?membership :memberOf ?union .
}
```
