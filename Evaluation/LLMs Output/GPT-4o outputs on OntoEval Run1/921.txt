The competency question "What role does a certain person have within a certain union group at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, unions, union memberships, and roles, which are sufficient to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the desired information.

Here is a SPARQL query that can be used to answer the competency question:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?roleName ?roleStart ?roleEnd
WHERE {
  ?personUnionRole a :Cl_PersonUnionRole .
  ?personUnionRole :roleOfPerson ?personUnionMembership .
  ?personUnionMembership :personMemberOfUnion ?person .
  ?personUnionMembership :unionHasMember ?union .
  ?personUnionRole :roleDuring ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
  ?role :roleStart ?roleStart .
  ?role :roleEnd ?roleEnd .
  
  # Optional filter to specify a certain person, union, and time point
  # FILTER(?person = <specific_person_URI>)
  # FILTER(?union = <specific_union_URI>)
  # FILTER(?roleStart <= "specific_date"^^xsd:date && ?roleEnd >= "specific_date"^^xsd:date)
}
```

This query retrieves the role information for a person within a union, including the role name and the time period during which the role is held. The optional filters can be used to specify a particular person, union, and point in time.
