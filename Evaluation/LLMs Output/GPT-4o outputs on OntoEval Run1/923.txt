**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, unions, roles, and time points, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements to answer the competency question fully. However, we can extract partial information about union memberships and roles.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?timePoint
WHERE {
  ?roleAssignment a :Cl_UnionRoleAssignment ;
                  :hasPerson ?person ;
                  :hasUnion ?union ;
                  :hasRole ?role .
  OPTIONAL { ?roleAssignment :timePoint ?timePoint . }
}
```
