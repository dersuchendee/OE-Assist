**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for evaluation statements given by a specific doctor for a specific employee. The ontology includes classes and properties related to evaluation statements, doctors, and employees, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific doctor and the evaluation statement they have given for a specific employee.

Partial SPARQL query to extract evaluation statements for employees:

```sparql
SELECT ?employee ?evaluationContent
WHERE {
  ?evaluationStatement a :Cl_EvaluationStatement .
  ?evaluationStatement :evaluatesEmployee ?employee .
  ?evaluationStatement :hasEvaluationContent ?evaluationContent .
}
```
