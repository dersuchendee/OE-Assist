**Yes**

The competency question "When did a certain theatre festival take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query the date of a theatre festival. Specifically, the `:hasDate` object property connects a `:Cl_TheatreFestival` to a `:Cl_Date`, and the `:dateValue` datatype property provides the actual date value.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasDate ?dateEntity .
  ?dateEntity :dateValue ?date .
}
```
