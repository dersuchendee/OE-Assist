**No**

The ontology provided does not include any classes or properties related to evaluation statements, doctors, or employees that would allow us to directly query for an evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee. The ontology primarily focuses on academic degrees, employment, union memberships, publications, and events, but lacks the necessary structure to model evaluation statements.

However, we can extract partial information related to doctors and employees, but not the evaluation statement itself:

```sparql
SELECT ?doctor ?employee
WHERE {
  ?doctor a :Doctor .
  ?employee a :Employee .
}
```
