**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a doctor with an evaluation statement for a specific employee. The ontology includes classes and properties related to evaluation statements, doctors, and employees, but it lacks the specific relationships needed to answer the competency question directly.

Partial answer SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?doctor ?evaluationStatement ?evaluationText ?evaluationDate ?employee
WHERE {
  ?doctor a :Cl_Doctor .
  ?doctor :hasEvaluationStatement ?evaluationStatement .
  ?evaluationStatement :evaluationText ?evaluationText .
  ?evaluationStatement :evaluationDate ?evaluationDate .
  ?evaluationStatement :evaluates ?employee .
}
```

This query retrieves evaluation statements made by doctors, including the text and date of the evaluation, but it does not specify the connection to a particular employee as required by the competency question.
