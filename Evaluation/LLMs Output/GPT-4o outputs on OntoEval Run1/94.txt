The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the specific dates when a theatre festival took place. The ontology includes a `hasDate` property for `Cl_TheatreFestival`, but without specific instances or data, we cannot extract the exact dates of the festivals. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information about theatre festivals:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :hasDate ?date . }
}
```
