The competency question "What is the evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to connect doctors, employees, and evaluation statements. We can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?doctor ?doctorLabel ?employee ?employeeLabel ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  ?evaluation rdf:type :Cl_Evaluation .
  ?evaluation :evaluatedBy ?doctor .
  ?doctor rdfs:label ?doctorLabel .
  ?evaluation :evaluates ?employee .
  ?employee rdfs:label ?employeeLabel .
  ?evaluation :evaluationStatement ?evaluationStatement .
}
```
