The competency question "What is the evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for evaluation statements given by doctors for employees. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?doctor ?employee ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  ?evaluation rdf:type :Cl_Evaluation .
  ?evaluation :evaluatedBy ?doctor .
  ?evaluation :evaluationOf ?employee .
  ?evaluation :evaluationStatement ?evaluationStatement .
}
```

This query retrieves the doctor, employee, and the evaluation statement from the ontology, which directly answers the competency question.
