**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific evaluation statement with a specific doctor and employee. The ontology includes classes and properties related to evaluations, doctors, and employees, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific doctor, a specific employee, and the evaluation statement given by the doctor for that employee.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists evaluation assignments along with the doctors and employees involved, but without the specific evaluation statement:

```sparql
SELECT ?doctor ?employee
WHERE {
  ?evaluationAssignment a :Cl_EvaluationAssignment .
  ?evaluationAssignment :evaluatedBy ?doctor .
  ?evaluationAssignment :evaluates ?employee .
}
```
