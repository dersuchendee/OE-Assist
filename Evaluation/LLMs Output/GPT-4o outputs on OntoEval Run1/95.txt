**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the specific dates when a theatre festival took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, occurrences, and dates, but it does not explicitly connect these in a way that allows for querying the specific dates of theatre festivals.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?occurrenceDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :occurrenceDate ?occurrenceDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the available occurrence dates for theatre festivals, but it may not provide the specific information needed to answer the competency question fully.
