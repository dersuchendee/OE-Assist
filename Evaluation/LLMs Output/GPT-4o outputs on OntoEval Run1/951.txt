The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate books and CDs to articles through the `op_composedOf` property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_Book, :Cl_CD .
  ?bookOrCD :op_composedOf ?article .
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article :dp_hasTitle ?articleTitle . }
}
```
