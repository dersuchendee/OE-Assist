The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate books and CDs to the articles they contain. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?collection ?article
WHERE {
  ?collection a :ArticleCollection .
  ?collection :contains ?article .
}
```

This query retrieves all article collections (books or CDs) and the articles they contain, which directly answers the competency question.
