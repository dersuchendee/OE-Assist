**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine which articles a specific book or CD is composed of. The ontology includes classes for publications, books, CDs, and articles, and there is a property `:containsArticle` that relates publications to articles. However, there is no specific property or class that directly links a specific book or CD to the articles it contains. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some information about publications and articles:

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?article
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  ?publication :containsArticle ?article .
}
```
