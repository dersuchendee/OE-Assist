**No**

The ontology provided does not include any specific properties or classes that directly relate a book or CD to the articles it is composed of. While there are classes for `Book`, `CD`, and `Article`, and a property `hasMember` that could potentially relate a collection to its members, there is no explicit connection between a specific book or CD and the articles it contains. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract information about books and CDs:

```sparql
SELECT ?collection ?article
WHERE {
  ?collection a :ArticleCollection .
  ?collection :hasMember ?article .
}
```

This query retrieves collections and their articles, but it does not distinguish between books and CDs or specify which articles belong to which specific book or CD.
