The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate publications, books, CDs, and articles. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?article
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  ?publication :contains ?article .
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
}
```

This query retrieves the articles contained within a specific publication, which can be a book or a CD, as both are subclasses of `:Cl_Publication`.
