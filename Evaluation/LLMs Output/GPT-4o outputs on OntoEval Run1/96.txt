**Yes**

The competency question "Where did a certain festival take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to determine the location of a festival occurrence. Specifically, the `:tookPlaceIn` property connects a `:Cl_FestivalOccurrence` to a `:Cl_City`, which directly answers the question.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festivalOccurrence a :Cl_FestivalOccurrence .
  ?festivalOccurrence :tookPlaceIn ?city .
  ?festivalOccurrence :hasDate ?date .
  ?festivalOccurrence :hasName ?festival .
}
```
