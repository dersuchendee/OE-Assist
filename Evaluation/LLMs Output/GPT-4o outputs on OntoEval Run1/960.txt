The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:composedOf` object property, which relates a `:Cl_Publication` (such as a book or CD) to `:Cl_Article`. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?publicationTitle ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  ?publication :publicationTitle ?publicationTitle .
  ?publication :composedOf ?article .
  ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
}
```
