**Yes**

The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for books, CDs, and articles, as well as the `containsArticle` property that links books and CDs to articles. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?article
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a ?type .
  FILTER(?type IN (:Cl_Book, :Cl_CD))
  ?bookOrCD :containsArticle ?article .
}
```

This query retrieves all books and CDs along with the articles they contain, which directly answers the competency question.
