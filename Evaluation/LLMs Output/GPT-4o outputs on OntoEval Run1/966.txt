**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a book or CD and the articles it is composed of. However, we can extract partial information about articles and their collections.

```sparql
SELECT ?articleCollection ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?articleCollection a :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  ?articleCollection :containsArticle ?article .
  ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
}
```
