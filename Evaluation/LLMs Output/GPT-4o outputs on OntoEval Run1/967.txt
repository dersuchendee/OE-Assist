The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Book`, `Cl_CD`, and `Cl_Article`, and the object property `containsArticle` which connects books and CDs to articles. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the articles contained in a specific book or CD.

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?article
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a ?type .
  FILTER(?type IN (:Cl_Book, :Cl_CD))
  ?bookOrCD :containsArticle ?article .
}
```
