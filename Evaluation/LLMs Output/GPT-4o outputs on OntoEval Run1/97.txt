The competency question "Where did a certain festival take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:tookPlaceIn` property, which relates a `:TheatreFestival` to a `:City`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :tookPlaceIn ?city .
