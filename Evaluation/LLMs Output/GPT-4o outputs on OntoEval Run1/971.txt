The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:containsArticle` object property, which connects `:Cl_Book` and `:Cl_CD` to `:Cl_Content`, a class that is a subclass of `:Cl_Article`. This allows us to query for articles contained within a specific book or CD.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?article
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_Book .
  ?bookOrCD :containsArticle ?content .
  ?content a :Cl_Article .
  BIND(?content AS ?article)
}
UNION
{
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_CD .
  ?bookOrCD :containsArticle ?content .
  ?content a :Cl_Article .
  BIND(?content AS ?article)
}
```

This query retrieves all articles contained in books or CDs by checking the `:containsArticle` property and ensuring the content is of type `:Cl_Article`.
