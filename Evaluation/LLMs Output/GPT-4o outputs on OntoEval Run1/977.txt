**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the number of pages a particular book contains. However, we can extract partial information about books and their properties.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?title ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?book :title ?title . }
  OPTIONAL { ?book :hasNumberOfPages ?numberOfPages . }
}
```
