**Yes**

The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Book` with the datatype property `:pageCount`, which allows us to query the number of pages in a book.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?title ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book .
  ?book :title ?title .
  ?book :pageCount ?pageCount .
}
```
