**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the number of pages a particular book contains. The ontology includes classes and properties related to publications, books, and articles, but it lacks a direct connection or property that specifies the number of pages for a book. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for books, but the page count cannot be retrieved.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?title
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?book :title ?title . }
}
```
