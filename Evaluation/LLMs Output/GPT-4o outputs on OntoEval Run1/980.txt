**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the number of pages for a particular book. However, we can extract partial information about books and their properties.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?book :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages . }
}
```
