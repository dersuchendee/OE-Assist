The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_BookOrCD` and the datatype property `numberOfPages`, which allows us to query the number of pages for a specific book.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the number of pages for a particular book:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_BookOrCD .
  ?book :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages .
}
```
