The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a `:pageCount` property for the `:Cl_Book` class, which allows us to query the number of pages for a specific book.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?bookLabel ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :pageCount ?pageCount .
  OPTIONAL { ?book rdfs:label ?bookLabel . }
}
```
