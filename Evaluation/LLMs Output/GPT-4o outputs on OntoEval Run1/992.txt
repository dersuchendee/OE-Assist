The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Book` and a data property `:pageCount` that associates a book with its page count. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the page count of a specific book.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :pageCount ?pageCount .
}
```
