The competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides information about books and CDs, their publication events, and the publication dates. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the publication date of a specific book or CD:

```sparql
SELECT ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?publicationEvent a :Cl_PublicationEvent ;
                    :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
  ?item a ?type ;
         :hasPublicationEvent ?publicationEvent .
  FILTER(?type IN (:Cl_Book, :Cl_CD))
}
```
