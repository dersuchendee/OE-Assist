**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a specific book or CD. The ontology includes a `hasPublicationDate` property, but it is not connected to specific instances of books or CDs in the provided ontology. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for publications and their publication dates, but it will not specify whether the publication is a book or a CD.

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Publication .
  ?publication :hasPublicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```
