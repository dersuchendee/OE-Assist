**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a specific book or CD. However, we can extract partial information about publications and their types.

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?publicationType ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?publication a ?publicationType .
  OPTIONAL { ?publication ns1:hasPublicationDate ?publicationDate . }
  FILTER(?publicationType IN (ns1:Book, ns1:CD))
}
```
