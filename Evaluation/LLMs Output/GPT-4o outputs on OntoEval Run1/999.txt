**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a book or CD. However, we can extract partial information about article collections and their types (Book or CD).

```sparql
SELECT ?articleCollection ?type
WHERE {
  ?articleCollection a :ArticleCollection .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?articleCollection a ?type .
    FILTER(?type IN (:Book, :CD))
  }
}
```
