**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the subject of a source. The ontology includes classes and properties related to sources and subjects, but it lacks a direct connection or property that would allow us to extract the subject of a source directly. The ontology uses reification to relate sources and subjects, but the competency question requires a direct relationship.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?source ?subject
WHERE {
  ?source a :Cl_Source .
  ?source :op_hasSourceSubject ?sourceSubject .
  ?sourceSubject :op_subjectOf ?subject .
}
```
