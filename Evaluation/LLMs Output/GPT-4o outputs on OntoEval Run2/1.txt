**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the subject of a source. The ontology defines a `hasSubject` property, but there are no instances or data linking a `Source` to a `Subject` using this property. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?source ?subject
WHERE {
  ?source a :Source .
  OPTIONAL { ?source :hasSubject ?subject . }
}
```
