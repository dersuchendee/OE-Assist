**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a musical instrument and its physical realization. The object property `op_hasPhysicalRealization` connects `Cl_MusicalInstrument` to `Cl_InstrumentRealization`, but there is no instance data or further details provided in the ontology to extract a complete answer. A partial answer can be extracted by identifying musical instruments that have a physical realization property.

```sparql
SELECT ?musicalInstrument ?instrumentRealization
WHERE {
  ?musicalInstrument a :Cl_MusicalInstrument .
  ?musicalInstrument :op_hasPhysicalRealization ?instrumentRealization .
}
```
