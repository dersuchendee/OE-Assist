**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a festival and its location. The `theatre:RomaLovesShakespeare` festival is associated with a location through the `theatre:hasLocation` property, but this property is not explicitly defined in the provided ontology. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a theatre:TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?festival theatre:hasLocation ?location .
  }
}
```
