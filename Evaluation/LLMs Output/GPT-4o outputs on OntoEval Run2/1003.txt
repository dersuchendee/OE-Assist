**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the publication date of a book or CD. However, we can extract partial information about media and their associated publications.

```sparql
SELECT ?media ?publication
WHERE {
  ?media a :Cl_Media .
  OPTIONAL { ?media :published ?publication . }
}
```
