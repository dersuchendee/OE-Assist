**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the publication date of a book or CD. The ontology includes classes and properties related to books, CDs, and publications, but it lacks a direct property or connection to capture the publication date of these items. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying books and CDs, but without the publication date.

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_Book .
  UNION
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_CD .
}
```
