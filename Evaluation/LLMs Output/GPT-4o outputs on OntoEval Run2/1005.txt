**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a book or CD. The ontology includes classes and properties related to books, CDs, and publications, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific book or CD and its publication date. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_BookOrCD .
  ?bookOrCD :published ?publication .
  ?publication :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```

This query assumes that there is a connection between a book or CD and its publication date through a `:published` property, but the ontology does not explicitly define this connection.
