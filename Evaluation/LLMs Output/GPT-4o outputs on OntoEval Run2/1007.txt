**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the publication date of books or CDs. However, we can extract partial information about publications.

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?publicationTitle ?publicationType
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  OPTIONAL { ?publication :publicationTitle ?publicationTitle . }
  OPTIONAL { ?publication :publicationType ?publicationType . }
}
```
