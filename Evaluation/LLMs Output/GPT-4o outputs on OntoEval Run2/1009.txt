**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the publication date of CDs, only books. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered. However, a partial answer can be obtained for books.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```
