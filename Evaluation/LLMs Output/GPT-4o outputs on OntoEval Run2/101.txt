**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a festival with a specific location where it took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to festivals, cities, and occurrences, but it lacks a direct property or connection that specifies the location of a festival occurrence. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying festival occurrences, but not their specific locations.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?occurrence
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasFestivalOccurrence ?occurrence .
}
```
