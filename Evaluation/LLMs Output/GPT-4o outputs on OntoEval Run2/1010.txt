The competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:publicationDate` property, which is applicable to both `:Cl_Book` and `:Cl_CD` classes. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the publication date of a book or CD.

```sparql
SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?item a ?type .
  ?type rdfs:subClassOf [ rdf:type owl:Class ; owl:unionOf ( :Cl_Book :Cl_CD ) ] .
  ?item :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabel . }
}
```
