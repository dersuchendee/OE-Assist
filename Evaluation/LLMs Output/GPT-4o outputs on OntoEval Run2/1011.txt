**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a specific book or CD. The ontology includes a class `Cl_ArticleCollection` which can be a book or a CD, but it does not have a direct property for publication date for individual books or CDs. The `publicationDate` property is associated with `Cl_ArticleCollection`, but the competency question asks for a specific book or CD, which is not directly modeled in the ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?articleCollection ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?articleCollection a :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  OPTIONAL { ?articleCollection :publicationDate ?publicationDate . }
}
```
