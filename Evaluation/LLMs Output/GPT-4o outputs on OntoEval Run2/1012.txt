**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the publication date of books or CDs. However, it does contain information about the publication date of article collections. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted for article collections.

```sparql
SELECT ?articleCollection ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  ?publication :publishedAs ?articleCollection .
  ?publication :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```
