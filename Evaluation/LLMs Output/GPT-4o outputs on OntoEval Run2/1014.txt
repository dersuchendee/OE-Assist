**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a specific book or CD. However, we can extract partial information about books and CDs, but without their publication dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?cd
WHERE {
  OPTIONAL { ?book a :Cl_Book . }
  OPTIONAL { ?cd a :Cl_CD . }
}
```
