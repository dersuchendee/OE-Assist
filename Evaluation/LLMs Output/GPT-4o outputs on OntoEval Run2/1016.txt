**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a specific book or CD. The ontology includes a `publicationDate` property, but it is not associated with any specific book or CD instances. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for all books and CDs with their publication dates, but it won't be specific to a certain book or CD.

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a [owl:unionOf(:Cl_Book :Cl_CD)] .
  ?bookOrCD :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```
