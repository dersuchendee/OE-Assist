**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a specific book or CD. However, we can extract partial information about books and CDs that have a publication date.

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_Book, :Cl_CD .
  ?bookOrCD :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```
