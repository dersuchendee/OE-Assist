**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the specific location where a festival took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to events, locations, and theatre festivals, but it lacks specific instances or data that would allow us to answer the competency question directly. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :takesPlaceIn ?city .
}
```

This query will return the cities where theatre festivals take place, but without specific instances or data, it cannot provide the exact location of a particular festival.
