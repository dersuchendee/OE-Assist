The competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `ns1:Seminar` with a property `ns1:hasDate` that indicates the date on which the seminar took place. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the date of a specific seminar.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a ns1:Seminar .
  ?seminar ns1:hasDate ?date .
}
```
