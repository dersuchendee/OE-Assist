The competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `:Seminar` and the datatype property `:hasDate`, which relates a seminar to its date. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the date of a seminar.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasDate ?date .
}
```
