The competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars, such as `Cl_SeminarOccurrence`, `Cl_Seminar`, `hasDate`, and `tookPlaceAt`. These allow us to query for the date of a seminar occurrence.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminarOccurrence a :Cl_SeminarOccurrence .
  ?seminarOccurrence :relatesToSeminar ?seminar .
  ?seminarOccurrence :hasDate ?date .
}
```
