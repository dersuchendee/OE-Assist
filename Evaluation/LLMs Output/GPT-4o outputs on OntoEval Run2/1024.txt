**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about seminars or their dates. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" using the given ontology. However, we can extract a partial answer by querying for any events that might be related to seminars, but without specific dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
}
```
