**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a seminar took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars, but it lacks a direct data property or object property that associates a seminar with a specific date. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying seminars, but without the specific date information.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
}
```
