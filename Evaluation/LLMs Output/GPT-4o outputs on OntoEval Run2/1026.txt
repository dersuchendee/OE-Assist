**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the date of a seminar. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars, but it lacks a direct property or connection to retrieve the date of a specific seminar. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists seminars without their dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
}
```
