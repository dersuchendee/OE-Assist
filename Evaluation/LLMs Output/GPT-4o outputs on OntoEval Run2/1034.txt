**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the date of a specific seminar. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Seminar` with a `seminarDate` property, but there is no direct link between a specific seminar and its date in the provided data. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for all seminars and their dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?date .
}
```
