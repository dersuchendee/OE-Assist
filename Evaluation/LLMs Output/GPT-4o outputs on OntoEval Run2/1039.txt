**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific seminar took place. The ontology includes a `:seminarDate` property for the `:Cl_Seminar` class, but there is no direct connection between a specific seminar and its date in the provided ontology. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by listing all seminars and their dates, but it cannot specify a certain seminar without additional information.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?date .
}
```
