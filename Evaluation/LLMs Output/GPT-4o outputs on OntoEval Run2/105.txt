**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a festival with a specific location. The `heldIn` property connects `Cl_TheatreFestival` to `Cl_City`, but there is no instance data or specific festival information provided in the ontology to answer the CQ directly. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :heldIn ?city .
}
```
