**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate articles with a specific seminar. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars and articles, but it lacks a direct connection between articles and the specific seminar they were presented at. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?article ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
  ?article :presentedIn ?presentation .
  ?presentation :seminar ?seminar .
}
```

This query attempts to find articles and the seminars they were presented in, but it may not fully answer the competency question due to the lack of a direct connection in the ontology.
