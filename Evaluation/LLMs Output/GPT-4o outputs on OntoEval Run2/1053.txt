**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate articles with a specific seminar. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars and articles, but it lacks a direct connection between a seminar and the articles presented in it. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists articles and seminars separately:

```sparql
SELECT ?article ?articleTitle ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle . }

  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate . }
}
```
