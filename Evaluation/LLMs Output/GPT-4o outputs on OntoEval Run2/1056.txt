```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?presentation rdf:type :Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation .
  ?presentation :presentedIn ?seminar .
  ?presentation :articlePresented ?article .
  
  ?seminar rdf:type :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
  
  ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel .
}
ORDER BY ?seminarDate
```
