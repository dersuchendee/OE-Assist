**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a festival. The `hasLocation` property is defined for `Cl_TheatreFestival`, but there is no instance data provided in the ontology to answer the CQ. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :hasLocation ?location . }
}
```
