**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a seminar. The ontology includes classes and properties related to hospitals, seminars, and their relationships, but it lacks a direct property or connection that specifies the location of a seminar. The closest information available is the relationship between a hospital and a seminar, but it does not specify the location of the seminar itself.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :holdsSeminar ?seminar .
}
```
