**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a seminar. While there are classes and properties related to seminars and locations, there is no explicit connection between a specific seminar and its location. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?location
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?seminar :tookPlaceAt ?location .
  }
}
```
