**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the specific location of a festival, such as a venue or address. It only contains information about the city where the festival takes place. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the city where the festival took place.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_Festival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :takesPlaceIn ?city .
}
```
