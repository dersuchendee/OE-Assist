**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a seminar. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars, seminar locations, and locations, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific seminar and its location. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?location
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?seminar :tookPlaceAt ?seminarLocation .
    ?seminarLocation :seminarLocation ?location .
  }
}
```
