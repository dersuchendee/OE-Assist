The competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate seminars to their locations. Specifically, the `:heldIn` property connects a `:Cl_Seminar` to a `:Cl_Hospital`, and the `:locatedIn` property connects a `:Cl_Hospital` to a `:Cl_City`. This allows us to determine the location of a seminar.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?hospital ?city
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :heldIn ?hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
}
```
