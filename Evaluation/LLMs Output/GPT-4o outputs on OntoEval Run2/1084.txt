**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a seminar. The ontology includes a `heldAt` property that connects a seminar to a hospital, but it does not specify the geographic location of the hospital. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the hospital where the seminar was held.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :heldAt ?hospital .
}
```
