**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a seminar. While there is a property `:seminarLocatedIn` that connects a seminar to a hospital, the competency question asks for a specific seminar's location, which is not directly represented in the ontology. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarLocatedIn ?hospital .
}
```
