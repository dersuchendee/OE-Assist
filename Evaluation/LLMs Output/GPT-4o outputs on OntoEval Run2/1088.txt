**Yes**

The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Seminar` class that ensures each seminar must have at least one article presented. This is represented by the `owl:someValuesFrom` restriction on the `hasArticle` property. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to verify this condition for all seminars.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasArticle ?article .
}
```

This query will return all seminars that have at least one article presented, which aligns with the competency question.
