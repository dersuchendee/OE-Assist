The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `:Seminar` with a restriction that ensures at least one `:Article` is presented at each seminar. This is represented by the `owl:minQualifiedCardinality "1"` restriction on the `:hasPresentedArticle` property.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract seminars and their presented articles:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentedArticle ?article .
}
```

This query retrieves all seminars and the articles presented at each seminar, ensuring that each seminar has at least one article presented, as required by the competency question.
