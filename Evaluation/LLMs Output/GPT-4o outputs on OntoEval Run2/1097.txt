**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to ensure that at least one article is always presented at each seminar. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars, articles, and presentations, but it does not enforce a constraint that guarantees the presence of at least one article per seminar.

Partial answer SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
  ?article :presentedAt ?presentation .
  ?presentation a :Cl_SeminarPresentation .
  ?presentation :presentedIn ?seminar .
}
```

This query retrieves seminars and articles presented, but it does not ensure that every seminar has at least one article.
