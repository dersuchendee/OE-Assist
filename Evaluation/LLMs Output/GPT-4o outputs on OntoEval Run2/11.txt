```sparql
SELECT ?instrument ?instrumentLabel ?physicalRealization ?physicalRealizationLabel
WHERE {
  ?instrument a :MusicalInstrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }

  ?instrument :hasPhysicalRealization ?physicalRealization .
  OPTIONAL { ?physicalRealization rdfs:label ?physicalRealizationLabel . }
}
```
