The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Cl_Seminar` class that ensures each seminar has at least one article presented, as indicated by the `owl:equivalentClass` restriction with `owl:minCardinality 1` on the `:presentedArticle` property.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract seminars and their presented articles:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
  ?seminar :presentedArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
```
