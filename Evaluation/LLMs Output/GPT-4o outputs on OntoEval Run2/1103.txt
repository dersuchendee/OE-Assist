The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Seminar` with a restriction that ensures at least one article is presented at each seminar. This is represented by the `owl:Restriction` on the `:presentedIn` property with `owl:minCardinality 1`.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract seminars and their presented articles:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?seminar rdf:type :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
  ?article rdf:type :Cl_SeminarArticle .
  ?article :presentedIn ?seminar .
  ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
}
```
