**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model the relationship between seminars and articles being presented at them. While there is a class `Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation`, it is not clear from the ontology that every seminar must have at least one article presented. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to find seminars and articles presented:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?presentation rdf:type :Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation .
  ?presentation :articlePresentedIn ?seminar .
  ?presentation :presentationOfArticle ?article .
}
```
