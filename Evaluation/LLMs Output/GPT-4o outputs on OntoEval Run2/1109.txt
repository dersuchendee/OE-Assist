The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Cl_Seminar` class that ensures each seminar has at least one article presented in it. This is represented by the `owl:someValuesFrom` restriction on the `:presentedIn` property, which requires that a seminar must have at least one associated article.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract seminars and their presented articles:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?article :presentedIn ?seminar .
}
```
