**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the specific location where a festival took place. It includes classes and properties related to festivals, events, dates, and locations, but it does not explicitly connect a festival to a specific location instance. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the available information about festivals and their associated events.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?event ?eventDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :festivalName ?festivalName ;
            :hasFestivalEvent ?event .
  ?event :hasDate ?date .
  ?date :eventDate ?eventDate .
}
```
