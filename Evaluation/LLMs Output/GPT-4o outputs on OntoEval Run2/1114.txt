**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine what the user is doing now. The ontology includes classes and properties related to a person being in a bathroom, facing a mirror, and holding an electric toothbrush, but it does not explicitly connect these to the activity of brushing teeth in a way that can be queried directly. The ontology lacks a direct representation of the current activity of the user.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?person ?activity
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :op_isIn ?bathroom .
  ?person :op_isFacing ?mirror .
  ?person :op_hasInHand ?toothbrush .
  ?person :op_isDoing ?activity .
}
```
