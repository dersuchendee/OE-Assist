**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the sequence of actions performed by the user. The ontology includes classes and properties related to user actions, locations, and times, but it lacks a mechanism to track the sequence or history of actions performed by a user. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for actions performed by the user, but it will not provide a chronological sequence.

```sparql
SELECT ?user ?action ?location ?time
WHERE {
  ?user a :Cl_User .
  ?user :op_performedAction ?userAction .
  ?userAction :op_actionType ?action .
  ?userAction :op_inLocation ?location .
  ?userAction :op_duringTime ?time .
}
```
