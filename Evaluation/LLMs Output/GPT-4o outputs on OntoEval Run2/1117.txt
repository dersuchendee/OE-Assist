**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the previous activity performed by the user. The ontology includes a `previousActivity` property, but there is no data or structure in the ontology that indicates a sequence of activities or links between different activity instances to determine what was done previously.

Partial SPARQL query to extract activities performed by the user:

```sparql
SELECT ?activity ?activityType
WHERE {
  ?activity a ?activityType .
  ?activity :performedBy :User .
}
```
