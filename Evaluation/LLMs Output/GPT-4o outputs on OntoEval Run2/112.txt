**No**

The ontology does not contain information about the specific location where a festival took place. It includes classes and properties related to festivals, dates, locations, plays, and other related entities, but it does not explicitly connect a festival to a specific location instance. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?location ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :festivalName ?festivalName .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?festivalLocation a :Cl_FestivalLocation ;
                      :hasFestival ?festival ;
                      :hasLocation ?location .
    ?location :locationName ?locationName .
  }
}
```
