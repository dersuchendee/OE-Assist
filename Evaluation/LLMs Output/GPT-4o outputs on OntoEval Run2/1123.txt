The competency question "Where does this user live/where does the system run?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about the user's location and the system's operation location. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?user ?location
WHERE {
  ?user a :User .
  ?user :hasLocation ?location .
}
```

This query retrieves the user and their associated location, which answers the competency question.
