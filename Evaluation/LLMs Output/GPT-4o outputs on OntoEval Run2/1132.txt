**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate devices with specific indoor locations. The `hasDevice` property is defined with a domain of `Cl_IndoorLocation`, but there is no class or instance of `Cl_IndoorLocation` in the ontology. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question. However, we can extract a partial answer by listing available devices.

```sparql
SELECT ?device
WHERE {
  ?device a :Cl_Device .
}
```
