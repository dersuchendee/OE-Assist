**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate content with specific devices and their functionalities. The ontology includes classes for devices, content, and functionalities, but it lacks the necessary relationships to directly answer the competency question. A partial answer can be extracted by identifying devices and their functionalities, but it won't specify the content displayed by each device.

```sparql
SELECT ?device ?functionality
WHERE {
  ?device a :Cl_Device .
  ?device :hasFunctionality ?functionality .
}
```
