**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query bookings during a specific time period. The ontology includes classes and properties related to users, calendars, bookings, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between bookings and specific time periods that would allow for querying bookings within a certain time frame.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?calendar ?booking ?startTime ?endTime
WHERE {
  ?calendar a :Cl_Calendar .
  ?calendar :containsBooking ?booking .
  ?booking :startTime ?startTime .
  ?booking :endTime ?endTime .
}
```
