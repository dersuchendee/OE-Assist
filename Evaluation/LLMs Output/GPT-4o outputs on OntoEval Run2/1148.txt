**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for events of a specific category during a certain time period. The ontology includes classes for events, movies, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between events and their availability during specific time periods. The reification class `Cl_Availability` is defined, but it is not used in the ontology to connect events with time periods.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?event ?startTime ?endTime
WHERE {
  ?event a :Cl_Event .
  ?event :isAvailableDuring ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :hasStartTime ?startTime .
  ?timePeriod :hasEndTime ?endTime .
}
```
