**Yes**

The competency question "What events of a specific event category, e.g. movies, are available during a certain time period?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides classes and properties to represent events, their categories, and the time periods during which they are available. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?eventLabel ?startTime ?endTime
WHERE {
  ?event a :Movie .
  OPTIONAL { ?event rdfs:label ?eventLabel . }
  ?event :isAvailableDuring ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :hasStartTime ?startTime .
  ?timePeriod :hasEndTime ?endTime .
}
ORDER BY ?startTime
```
