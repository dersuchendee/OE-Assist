**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about the location of a festival. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, and locations, but there is no direct connection between a festival and its location. Therefore, the competency question "Where did a certain festival take place?" cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?festival :locatedIn ?locationInfo .
    ?locationInfo :locationCity ?location .
  }
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve the location of festivals, but due to the lack of direct connections in the ontology, it may not return complete results.
