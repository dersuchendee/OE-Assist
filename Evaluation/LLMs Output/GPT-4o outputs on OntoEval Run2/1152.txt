**No**

The ontology provided does not include any information about the start and end times of events directly. It only defines the structure for associating events with event times, but there is no data or instances provided to extract specific start and end times for any event. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only extract partial information about the structure, not specific event times.

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?eventTime
WHERE {
  ?event a :Cl_Event .
  ?event :op_hasEventTime ?eventTime .
}
```
