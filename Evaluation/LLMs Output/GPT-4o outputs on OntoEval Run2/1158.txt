**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves retrieving information about ticket options, show times, and seat selections, which are all represented in the ontology. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?ticketOption ?showTime ?seat ?theatre
WHERE {
  ?event a :Cl_Event .
  ?event :hasTicketOption ?ticketOption .

  ?ticketOption :hasShowTime ?showTime .
  ?showTime :showDateTime ?showDateTime .

  ?ticketOption :hasSeat ?seat .
  ?seat :seatNumber ?seatNumber .
  ?seat :locatedIn ?theatre .
}
ORDER BY ?event ?showDateTime
```
