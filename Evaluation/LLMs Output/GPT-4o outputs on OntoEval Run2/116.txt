**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the specific location (e.g., city or venue) where a festival took place. The closest related property is `takesPlaceIn`, which connects a `Cl_TheatreFestival` to a `Cl_City`, but there is no instance data or specific location information provided in the ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :takesPlaceIn ?city . }
}
```
