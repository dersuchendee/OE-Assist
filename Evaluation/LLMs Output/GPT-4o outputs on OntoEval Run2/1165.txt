The competency question "From what source does this data originate?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a class `Data` with a property `originatesFrom` that links it to a `Source`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the source of each data instance.

```sparql
SELECT ?data ?source
WHERE {
  ?data a :Data .
  ?data :originatesFrom ?source .
}
```
