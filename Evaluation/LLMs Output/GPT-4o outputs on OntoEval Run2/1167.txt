**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it includes classes and properties related to material flows, rebound effects, and added energy requirements. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?materialFlow ?reboundEffect ?energyRequirement
WHERE {
  ?materialFlow a :MaterialFlow .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?materialFlow :hasReboundEffect ?reboundEffect .
  }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?materialFlow :hasAddedEnergyRequirement ?energyRequirement .
  }
}
```
