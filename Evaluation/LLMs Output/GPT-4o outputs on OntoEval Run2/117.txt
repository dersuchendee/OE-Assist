**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a festival. The `hasLocation` property is defined for `Cl_TheatreFestival`, but there is no connection between a specific festival instance and its location in the ontology. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :hasLocation ?location . }
}
```
