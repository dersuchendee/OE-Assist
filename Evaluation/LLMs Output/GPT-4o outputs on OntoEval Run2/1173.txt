**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves retrieving the time of data changes and their detailed breakdown, which are represented in the ontology. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?energyData ?changeTime ?breakdown
WHERE {
  ?energyData a :EnergyData .
  ?energyData :hasChange ?dataChange .
  ?dataChange :hasTimestamp ?changeTime .
  ?energyData :hasDetailedBreakdown ?breakdown .
}
```
