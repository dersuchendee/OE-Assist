**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as it involves querying the relationship between a mounting system and its possible execution techniques, which is directly represented in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?mountingSystem ?executionTechnique
WHERE {
  ?mountingSystem a :MountingSystem .
  ?mountingSystem :hasPossibleExecutionTechnique ?executionTechnique .
}
```
