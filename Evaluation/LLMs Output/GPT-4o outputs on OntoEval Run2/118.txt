**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about the specific location where a festival took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, cities, and locations, but it does not explicitly connect a festival to a specific city or location. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?festival :locatedIn ?location .
    ?location :locationCity ?cityName .
  }
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve the festival and its location, but without explicit data linking a festival to a specific city, it will not provide a complete answer.
