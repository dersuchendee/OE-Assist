**Yes**

The competency question "Which is the weight of the bell?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology defines a class `Bell` with a datatype property `hasWeight` that specifies the weight of the bell. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the weight of each bell.

```sparql
SELECT ?bell ?weight
WHERE {
  ?bell a :Bell .
  ?bell :hasWeight ?weight .
}
```
