**Yes**

The competency question "Where did she live?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a `Person` class and a `Place` class, with an object property `hasLivedIn` that connects a person to a place. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?place
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :hasLivedIn ?place .
}
```
