**Yes**

The competency question "In what context the meeting happened?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `Meeting` class with a property `hasContext` that links to the `Context` class. This allows us to query for the context of each meeting.

```sparql
SELECT ?meeting ?context
WHERE {
  ?meeting a :Meeting .
  ?meeting :hasContext ?context .
}
```
