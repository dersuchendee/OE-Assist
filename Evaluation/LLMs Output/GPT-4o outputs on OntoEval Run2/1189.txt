The competency question "What is the nature of the event?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Event` and the property `hasNature` which links an event to its nature. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the nature of each event.

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?nature
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  ?event :hasNature ?nature .
}
```
