The competency question "What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides information about theatre festivals, plays, and their appearances at festivals. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festivalName ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :hasName ?festivalName ;
            :hasProduction ?appearance .

  ?appearance a :Cl_FestivalPlayAppearance ;
              :featuresPlay ?play .

  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :hasName ?playName .
}
ORDER BY ?festivalName ?playName
```

This query retrieves the names of plays that were featured in each theatre festival, which directly answers the competency question.
