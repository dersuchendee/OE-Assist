**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine if an event is religious or secular. The classes `ReligiousEvent` and `SecularEvent` are defined, but there is no property or mechanism in the ontology to classify a specific instance of `Event` as either `ReligiousEvent` or `SecularEvent`. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only extract partial information about events without specifying their type.

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?eventType
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  OPTIONAL {
    { ?event a :ReligiousEvent . BIND("Religious" AS ?eventType) }
    UNION
    { ?event a :SecularEvent . BIND("Secular" AS ?eventType) }
  }
}
```
