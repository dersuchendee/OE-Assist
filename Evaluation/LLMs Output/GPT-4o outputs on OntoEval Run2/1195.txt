**No**

The competency question "Were they invited? Was the meeting accidental?" is not fully supported by the ontology. The ontology provides information about whether a person is invited to an event and whether a meeting is accidental, but it does not directly link these two aspects in a way that allows us to answer the question for specific individuals and meetings.

Partial SPARQL query to extract information about whether a meeting was accidental:

```sparql
SELECT ?meeting ?isAccidental
WHERE {
  ?meeting a :Meeting .
  ?meeting :isAccidental ?isAccidental .
}
```

Partial SPARQL query to extract information about whether a person was invited to an event:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?event
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :isInvitedTo ?event .
}
```
