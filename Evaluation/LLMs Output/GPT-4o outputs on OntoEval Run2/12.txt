The competency question "Which are the parts of an instrument?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a class `Cl_InstrumentPart` and an object property `hasPart` that relates a `Cl_MusicalInstrument` to its parts. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the parts of each musical instrument.

```sparql
SELECT ?instrument ?part
WHERE {
  ?instrument a :Cl_MusicalInstrument .
  ?instrument :hasPart ?part .
}
```
