**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between plays and theatre festivals through productions. The ontology defines plays, theatre festivals, and productions, but it lacks the necessary relationships to directly associate plays with specific theatre festivals via productions. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?festival
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  ?play :performedAt ?festival .
}
```
