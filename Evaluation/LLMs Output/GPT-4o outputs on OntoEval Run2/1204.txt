The competency question "What are the original parts of the organ?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for "Organ" and "Organ Part," and there is a datatype property "isOriginal" that indicates whether an organ part is original. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the original parts of an organ.

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?organPart
WHERE {
  ?organ a :Organ .
  ?organ :hasPart ?organPart .
  ?organPart :isOriginal true .
}
```
