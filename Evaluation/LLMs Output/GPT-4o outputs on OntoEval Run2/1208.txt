**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the level of confidence for a composition being a variant in a tune family, which is represented in the ontology through the `VariantRelationship` class and its associated properties.

```sparql
SELECT ?composition ?tuneFamily ?confidence
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition .
  ?composition :hasVariantRelationship ?variantRelationship .

  ?variantRelationship :involvesComposition ?composition .
  ?variantRelationship :involvesTuneFamily ?tuneFamily .
  ?variantRelationship :hasLevelOfConfidence ?confidence .
}
```
