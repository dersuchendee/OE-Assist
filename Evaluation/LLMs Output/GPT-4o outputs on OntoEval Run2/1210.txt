**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to compare or analyze similarities/differences between compositions within a tune family based on a specific measure. The ontology defines classes and properties for compositions, tune families, measures, and measure values, but it lacks the necessary structure or properties to perform comparative analysis directly.

Partial answer SPARQL query:
```sparql
SELECT ?composition ?measure ?value
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition .
  ?composition :isInTuneFamily :TuneFamilyX .
  ?composition :hasMeasureValue ?measureValue .
  ?measureValue :isMeasureOf ?measure .
  ?measureValue :hasValue ?value .
}
```
