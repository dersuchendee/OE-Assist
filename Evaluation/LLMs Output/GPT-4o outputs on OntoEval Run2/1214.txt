**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for specific chemical characteristics associated with environments where aquatic microbe species are found. The ontology defines the relationship between aquatic microbe species and environments with chemical characteristics, but it does not specify individual chemical characteristics or provide a way to query them directly.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?microbeSpecies ?environment
WHERE {
  ?microbeSpecies a :AquaticMicrobeSpecies .
  ?microbeSpecies :isFoundInEnvironment ?environment .
}
```
