The competency question is supported by the ontology as it includes classes and properties that relate rare species to the ecological functions they perform within microbial communities. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?rareSpecies ?function
WHERE {
  ?rareSpecies a :RareSpecies .
  ?rareSpecies :performsFunction ?function .
}
```
