**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying for annotation properties related to the class `RareSpecies`. The ontology provides annotation properties such as `conservationStatus`, `populationTrend`, and `documentedBy` that are applied to the class `RareSpecies`.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the specific annotation properties used to document rare species within the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?annotationProperty ?label
WHERE {
  ?annotationProperty a owl:AnnotationProperty ;
                      :appliesToClass :RareSpecies ;
                      rdfs:label ?label .
}
```
