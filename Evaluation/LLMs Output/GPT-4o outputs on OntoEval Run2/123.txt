**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate plays with specific theatre festivals. The ontology includes classes and properties for TheatreFestival, TheatreProduction, and Play, but it lacks a direct connection between TheatreFestival and Play. The property chain axiom (theatre:hasProduction theatre:hasPlay) is defined, but there is no instance data that connects specific plays to specific festivals.

Partial answer SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?festival a theatre:TheatreFestival .
  ?festival theatre:hasProduction ?production .
  ?production theatre:hasPlay ?play .
}
