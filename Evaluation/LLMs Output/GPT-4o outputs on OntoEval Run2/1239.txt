**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it includes classes and properties that relate beech forests to carbon and nitrogen cycling in nearby groundwater systems. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the relevant information:

```sparql
SELECT ?beechForest ?groundwaterSystem ?process
WHERE {
  ?beechForest a :BeechForest .
  ?beechForest :hasNearbyGroundwaterSystem ?groundwaterSystem .
  
  ?process a ?processType .
  ?processType rdfs:subClassOf :BiogeochemicalProcess .
  ?process :occursIn ?groundwaterSystem .
  
  FILTER(?processType IN (:CarbonCycling, :NitrogenCycling))
}
```
