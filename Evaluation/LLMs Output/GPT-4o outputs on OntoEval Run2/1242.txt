**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific agent (person or organization) with the monitoring of hospitalizations for a disease in a geographical area. The ontology defines the classes and properties related to agents, diseases, geographical areas, and hospitalizations, but it lacks a direct connection between an agent and the monitoring activity for hospitalizations.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?agent ?hospitalization ?disease ?area
WHERE {
  ?agent a :Agent .
  ?agent :monitors ?hospitalization .
  ?hospitalization :hasDisease ?disease .
  ?hospitalization :occursIn ?area .
}
```
