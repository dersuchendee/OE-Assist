**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as it involves querying the time when the level of a chemical substance is recorded in a water body. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to construct such a query.

```sparql
SELECT ?waterBody ?chemicalSubstance ?measurementTime
WHERE {
  ?observation a :ChemicalSubstanceObservation .
  ?observation :isObservationOfWaterBody ?waterBody .
  ?observation :isObservationOfChemicalSubstance ?chemicalSubstance .
  ?observation :hasMeasurementTime ?measurementTime .
}
```
