The competency question "How many distinct disease categories are there?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines several subclasses of the `DiseaseCategory` class, which can be queried to determine the number of distinct disease categories.

```sparql
SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?diseaseCategory) AS ?numDiseaseCategories)
WHERE {
  ?diseaseCategory a :DiseaseCategory .
}
```
