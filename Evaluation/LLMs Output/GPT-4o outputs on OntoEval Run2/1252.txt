**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the spatial distribution of measurements across different areas. It only defines the relationships between areas and measurements but lacks spatial attributes or properties to determine distribution.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?area ?measurement
WHERE {
  ?area a :Area .
  ?area :hasMeasurement ?measurement .
}
```
