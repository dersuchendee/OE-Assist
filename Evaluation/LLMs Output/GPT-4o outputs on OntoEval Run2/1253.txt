**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as it involves retrieving information about monitoring sites, the water quality parameters they observe, and the times at which these observations are recorded. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to construct a SPARQL query to answer this question.

```sparql
SELECT ?monitoringSite ?parameter ?time
WHERE {
  ?monitoringSite a :MonitoringSite .
  ?monitoringSite :hasObservation ?observation .

  ?observation a :WaterQualityObservation .
  ?observation :observesParameter ?parameter .
  ?observation :recordedAtTime ?time .
}
ORDER BY ?monitoringSite ?time
```
