**No**

The ontology does not have a direct connection between chemical measurements and water concentration values. The ontology defines a `ChemicalMeasurement` class with a `hasConcentrationValue` property, but it does not specify that these measurements are related to water. The `inMedium` property connects `ChemicalMeasurement` to `Water`, but it does not provide concentration values specifically for water. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?chemicalMeasurement ?concentrationValue
WHERE {
  ?chemicalMeasurement a :ChemicalMeasurement .
  ?chemicalMeasurement :hasConcentrationValue ?concentrationValue .
}
```
