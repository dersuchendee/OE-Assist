**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the units of measure for chemical measurements in water. The ontology defines a class `UnitOfMeasure` and a property `hasUnitOfMeasure`, but there is no instance data or further specification of what these units are. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying chemical measurements and their associated units, if any, but the specific units themselves are not defined in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?chemicalMeasurement ?unitOfMeasure
WHERE {
  ?chemicalMeasurement a :ChemicalMeasurement .
  OPTIONAL { ?chemicalMeasurement :hasUnitOfMeasure ?unitOfMeasure . }
}
```
