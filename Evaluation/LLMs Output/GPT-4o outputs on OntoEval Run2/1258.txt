**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific quality with a flow at a specific time. The ontology defines a `FlowQualityAssessment` class that connects a flow, its quality, and a time, but it does not provide a direct way to query the quality of a flow at a specific time without additional data or properties that specify which flow is being assessed at which time.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?flow ?quality ?time
WHERE {
  ?assessment a :FlowQualityAssessment .
  ?assessment :assessesFlow ?flow .
  ?assessment :hasQuality ?quality .
  ?assessment :atTime ?time .
}
```
