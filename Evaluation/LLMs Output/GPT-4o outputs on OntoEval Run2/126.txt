**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to connect plays to specific theatre festivals, which is necessary to answer the competency question. However, we can extract partial information about theatre festivals and productions.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?production
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :festivalName ?festivalName . }
  ?festival :hasFestivalProduction ?production .
}
```
