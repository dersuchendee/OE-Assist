The competency question "From what source does this data originate?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a class `Data` that has a property `hasSource` linking it to the class `Source`. This allows us to query for the source of each data instance.

```sparql
SELECT ?data ?source
WHERE {
  ?data a :Data .
  ?data :hasSource ?source .
}
```
