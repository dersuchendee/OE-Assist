The competency question "What are the potential rebound effects of this action/process?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `ReboundEffect` and the property `measuresReboundEffect` which connects `Evaluation` to `ReboundEffect`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the potential rebound effects associated with actions or processes.

```sparql
SELECT ?action ?evaluation ?reboundEffect
WHERE {
  ?action a :Action .
  ?action :hasEvaluation ?evaluation .
  ?evaluation :measuresReboundEffect ?reboundEffect .
}
```
