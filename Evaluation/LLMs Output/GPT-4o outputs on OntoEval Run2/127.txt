**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between theatre festivals and the plays that can be seen during them. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, and productions, but it lacks a direct property or relationship that links a specific play to a specific theatre festival. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?play
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasPlay ?play .
}
```

This query attempts to find plays associated with theatre festivals, but without a direct link between specific plays and specific festivals, it cannot fully answer the competency question.
