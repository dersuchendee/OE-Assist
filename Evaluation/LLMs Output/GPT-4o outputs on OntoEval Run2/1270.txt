**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific point in time with an energy flow. The ontology defines `EnergyFlow` and `EnergyData` classes, and the `EnergyData` class has a `hasTimestamp` property, but there is no direct way to query for a specific point in time for an energy flow.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?energyFlow ?data ?timestamp
WHERE {
  ?energyFlow a :EnergyFlow .
  ?energyFlow :hasData ?data .
  ?data :hasTimestamp ?timestamp .
}
```
