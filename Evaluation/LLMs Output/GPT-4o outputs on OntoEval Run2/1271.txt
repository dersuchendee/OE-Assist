**No**

The ontology does not provide any information or metrics related to the efficiency of a process. It only specifies the types of information required by a `CollaborationProcess`. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only extract the types of information required by a `CollaborationProcess`, not its efficiency.

```sparql
SELECT ?process ?infoType
WHERE {
  ?process a :CollaborationProcess .
  ?process ?property ?infoType .
  FILTER(?property IN (:requiresInfrastructureInfo, :requiresProcessInfo, :requiresEnergyRecoveryInfo, :requiresStakeholderInfo, :requiresEnergyDemandSurplusInfo, :requiresValueInfo))
}
```
