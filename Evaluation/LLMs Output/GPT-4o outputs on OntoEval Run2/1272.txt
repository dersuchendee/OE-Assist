The competency question "What information is needed to collaborate and align processes?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology defines a `CollaborationProcess` class that requires various types of information, such as `InfrastructureInfo`, `ProcessInfo`, `EnergyRecoveryInfo`, `StakeholderInfo`, `EnergyDemandSurplusInfo`, and `ValueInfo`. These are the types of information needed to collaborate and align processes.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the required information types for collaboration processes:

```sparql
SELECT ?infoType
WHERE {
  ?collaborationProcess a :CollaborationProcess .
  {
    ?collaborationProcess :requiresInfrastructureInfo ?info .
    BIND("InfrastructureInfo" AS ?infoType)
  } UNION {
    ?collaborationProcess :requiresProcessInfo ?info .
    BIND("ProcessInfo" AS ?infoType)
  } UNION {
    ?collaborationProcess :requiresEnergyRecoveryInfo ?info .
    BIND("EnergyRecoveryInfo" AS ?infoType)
  } UNION {
    ?collaborationProcess :requiresStakeholderInfo ?info .
    BIND("StakeholderInfo" AS ?infoType)
  } UNION {
    ?collaborationProcess :requiresEnergyDemandSurplusInfo ?info .
    BIND("EnergyDemandSurplusInfo" AS ?infoType)
  } UNION {
    ?collaborationProcess :requiresValueInfo ?info .
    BIND("ValueInfo" AS ?infoType)
  }
}
```
