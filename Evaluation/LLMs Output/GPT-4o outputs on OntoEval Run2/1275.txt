**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine if the sound in a place is performed by hand or by electric means. The ontology includes a `SoundPractice` class with a `hasMethod` property that relates to `SoundMethod`, but it does not specify whether the method is manual or electric. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?bellTower ?soundMethod
WHERE {
  ?bellTower a :BellTower .
  ?bellTower :currentSoundPractice ?soundPractice .
  ?soundPractice :hasMethod ?soundMethod .
}
```
