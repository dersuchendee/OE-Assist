**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific musician with the places they visited. The ontology only allows us to know that musicians participate in events, and events have locations. However, there is no direct link between a specific musician and the places they visited. We can only extract partial information about the events and their locations.

```sparql
SELECT ?musician ?event ?place
WHERE {
  ?musician a :Musician .
  ?musician :participatesIn ?event .
  ?event :hasLocation ?place .
}
```
