**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to extract the residence location of a person. The ontology includes a `ResidenceEvent` class, which is a subclass of `Event`, and events can have locations. However, there is no direct connection between a `Person` and a `ResidenceEvent` that specifies the location of residence. The ontology would need a specific property or connection to link a `Person` to a `ResidenceEvent` and its location.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?person ?location
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :hasEvent ?event .
  ?event a :ResidenceEvent .
  ?event :atLocation ?location .
}
```
