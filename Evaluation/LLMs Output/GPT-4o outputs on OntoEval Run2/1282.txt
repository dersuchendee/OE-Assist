The competency question "Did musician X and performer Y ever meet? Where, when, and why?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to determine if a meeting occurred between two individuals, as well as the location, time, and reason for the meeting.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?meeting ?location ?time ?reason
WHERE {
  ?meeting a :Meeting .
  ?meeting :hasParticipant ?musician .
  ?meeting :hasParticipant ?performer .
  ?musician a :Musician .
  ?performer a :Performer .
  ?meeting :hasLocation ?location .
  ?meeting :hasTime ?time .
  ?meeting :hasReason ?reason .
  
  # Replace "X" and "Y" with the specific musician and performer URIs or labels
  FILTER(?musician = <http://www.example.org/test#MusicianX> && ?performer = <http://www.example.org/test#PerformerY>)
}
```

This query checks for meetings that have both a musician and a performer as participants and retrieves the location, time, and reason for those meetings. You would need to replace `<http://www.example.org/test#MusicianX>` and `<http://www.example.org/test#PerformerY>` with the actual URIs or labels of the specific musician and performer you are interested in.
