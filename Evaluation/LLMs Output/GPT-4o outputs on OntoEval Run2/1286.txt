**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any properties or data that would allow us to determine whether an event is religious or secular. The classes `ReligiousEvent` and `SecularEvent` are defined, but there is no information or properties that can be queried to distinguish between the two for a given event instance.

Partial SPARQL query to list events without determining their type:

```sparql
SELECT ?event
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
}
```
