**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the provenance of event attendees, which is represented in the ontology through the classes and properties related to `Event`, `Attendee`, and `Provenance`. The ontology provides the necessary structure to extract information about the provenance of attendees, including the source, reason, and mechanism.

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?attendee ?provenance ?source ?reason ?mechanism
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  ?event :hasAttendee ?attendee .

  ?attendee :hasProvenance ?provenance .

  ?provenance :documentedBy ?source .
  ?provenance :hasReason ?reason .
  ?provenance :hasMechanism ?mechanism .
}
```
