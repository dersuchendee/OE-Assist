**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate plays with specific theatre festivals. The `hasPlay` property is defined with a domain of `Cl_TheatreFestival` and a range of `Cl_Play`, but there is no instance data or specific connection between plays and festivals in the ontology provided. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by listing plays, but it won't be specific to any theatre festival.

```sparql
SELECT ?play
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
}
```
