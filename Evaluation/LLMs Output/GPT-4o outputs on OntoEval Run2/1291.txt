**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to characterize the relation among participants in an event. The ontology includes classes and properties for events, participants, and their roles, but it lacks explicit properties or classes to define the nature of relationships among participants within an event.

Partial SPARQL query to extract participants in events:

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?participant
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  ?event :hasParticipant ?participant .
}
```
