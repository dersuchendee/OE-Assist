**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to extract the places where musicians played. The ontology only specifies that events have locations and participants, but it does not provide a direct link between musicians and places. A partial answer can be extracted by querying the events and their locations, but it will not directly answer the CQ about where musicians played.

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?place
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  ?event :hasLocation ?place .
}
```
