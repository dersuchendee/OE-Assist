The competency question "Where were the musicians coming from?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology defines a class `Musician` with a property `comesFrom` that links to a `Place`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the places associated with each musician.

```sparql
SELECT ?musician ?place
WHERE {
  ?musician a :Musician .
  ?musician :comesFrom ?place .
}
```
