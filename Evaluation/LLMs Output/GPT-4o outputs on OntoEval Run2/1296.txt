The competency question "What was the composer’s network (patrons, institutions …)?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that define a composer's network, including patrons and institutions, which are subclasses of `NetworkEntity`. The `Composer` class has a property `hasNetworkMember` that connects it to `NetworkEntity`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the composer's network.

```sparql
SELECT ?composer ?networkMember ?networkMemberType
WHERE {
  ?composer a :Composer .
  ?composer :hasNetworkMember ?networkMember .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?networkMember a ?networkMemberType .
    FILTER(?networkMemberType IN (:Patron, :Institution))
  }
}
```
