**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for both builders and renovators of an organ. The ontology has separate properties for builders (`:hasBuilder`) and renovators (`:hasRenovator`), but there is no direct connection between these two roles for a single organ. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract either builders or renovators:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?builder ?renovator
WHERE {
  ?organ a :Organ .
  OPTIONAL { ?organ :hasBuilder ?builder . }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?organ :hasRestoration ?restoration .
    ?restoration :hasRenovator ?renovator .
  }
}
```
