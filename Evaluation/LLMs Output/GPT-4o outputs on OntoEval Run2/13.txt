The competency question "Which are the parts of an instrument?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines the classes `MusicalInstrument` and `InstrumentPart`, and the object properties `hasPart` and `isPartOf`, which express the relationship between musical instruments and their parts. Therefore, a SPARQL query can be constructed to retrieve the parts of a musical instrument.

```sparql
SELECT ?instrument ?instrumentLabel ?part ?partLabel
WHERE {
  ?instrument a :MusicalInstrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }

  ?instrument :hasPart ?part .
  OPTIONAL { ?part rdfs:label ?partLabel . }
}
```
