**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the geographic location of the original parts of an organ. The ontology includes classes and properties related to organs, organ parts, and their locations, but it does not specify how to identify the original parts or their specific locations. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?originalPart ?location
WHERE {
  ?organ a :Organ .
  ?originalPart a :OriginalPart .
  ?originalPart :originalPartOf ?organ .
  OPTIONAL { ?originalPart :currentLocation ?location . }
}
```
