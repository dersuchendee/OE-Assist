**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when an organ is moved to another location. The ontology includes classes and properties related to movement events, but it does not specify a direct connection between an organ and the specific date of movement. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information about movement events:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?movementEvent ?movementDate ?movedFrom ?movedTo
WHERE {
  ?organ a :Organ .
  ?organ :hasMovementEvent ?movementEvent .
  ?movementEvent :movementDate ?movementDate .
  ?movementEvent :movedFrom ?movedFrom .
  ?movementEvent :movedTo ?movedTo .
}
```
