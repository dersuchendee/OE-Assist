**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves relationships between tune families and similarity measures, which are modeled in the ontology. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?relatedTuneFamily ?similarityMeasure
WHERE {
  ?relationship a :TuneFamilyRelationship .
  ?relationship :hasSource :TuneFamilyX .
  ?relationship :hasTarget ?relatedTuneFamily .
  ?relationship :usesSimilarityMeasure ?similarityMeasure .
}
```
