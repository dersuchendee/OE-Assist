**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the primary CO2 fixation pathways specifically in beech forests. The ontology defines a class `BeechForest` as a subclass of `ForestEcosystem`, which has a restriction on the property `hasPrimaryCO2FixationPathway`. However, there is no explicit data or instances provided in the ontology to extract specific pathways for beech forests.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?beechForest ?pathway
WHERE {
  ?beechForest a :BeechForest .
  ?beechForest :hasPrimaryCO2FixationPathway ?pathway .
}
```
