The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the chemical parameters associated with specific aquifer fungi. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to construct such a query.

```sparql

WHERE {
  ?fungus a :AquiferFungus .
  ?fungus :hasAssociatedChemicalParameter ?chemicalParameter .
}
```
