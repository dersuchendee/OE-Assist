**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the ecological functions performed by rare species within microbial communities. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to construct a SPARQL query to extract this information.

```sparql
SELECT ?rareSpecies ?function
WHERE {
  ?community a :MicrobialCommunity .
  ?community :hasMember ?rareSpecies .
  ?rareSpecies a :RareSpecies .
  ?rareSpecies :performsFunction ?function .
}
```
