**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it includes classes and properties that describe trophic relationships between species, specifically within habitats. The ontology defines a `TrophicRelationship` class with properties `hasConsumer`, `hasResource`, and `occursIn`, which can be used to model the trophic relationships between different species of aquifer microbes.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the trophic relationships between different species of aquifer microbes:

```sparql
SELECT ?consumer ?consumerLabel ?resource ?resourceLabel ?habitat ?habitatLabel
WHERE {
  ?relationship a :TrophicRelationship .
  ?relationship :hasConsumer ?consumer .
  OPTIONAL { ?consumer rdfs:label ?consumerLabel . }
  
  ?relationship :hasResource ?resource .
  OPTIONAL { ?resource rdfs:label ?resourceLabel . }
  
  ?relationship :occursIn ?habitat .
  ?habitat a :AquiferMicrobeHabitat .
  OPTIONAL { ?habitat rdfs:label ?habitatLabel . }
}
```
