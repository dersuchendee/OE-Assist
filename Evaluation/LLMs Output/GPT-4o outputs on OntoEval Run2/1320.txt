**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it includes classes and properties that relate aquatic fungi, heterotrophs, and aquifers through interactions that affect abundance and activity. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?aquaticFungi ?heterotroph ?aquifer ?abundanceEffect ?activityEffect
WHERE {
  ?interaction a :Interaction .
  ?interaction :hasInfluencer ?aquaticFungi .
  ?interaction :hasInfluenced ?heterotroph .
  ?interaction :occursIn ?aquifer .
  ?interaction :affectsAbundance ?abundanceEffect .
  ?interaction :affectsActivity ?activityEffect .
}
```
