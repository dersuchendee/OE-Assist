The ontology does not provide specific information about the role of rubisco in the CO2 fixation process. While the ontology includes classes and properties related to enzymes, biochemical processes, and cycles, it lacks specific instances or properties that describe the role of rubisco in the CO2 fixation process.

Partial SPARQL query to extract related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?enzyme ?role ?process
WHERE {
  ?enzyme a :Enzyme .
  ?enzyme :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :inProcess ?process .
  ?process a :CO2FixationProcess .
}
