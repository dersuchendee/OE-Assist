The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the relationships between BeechForest, CarbonSequestration, and CarbonCycling, which are all defined in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?beechForest ?carbonSequestration ?carbonCycling
WHERE {
  ?beechForest a :BeechForest .
  ?beechForest :participatesIn ?carbonSequestration .
  ?carbonSequestration :contributesTo ?carbonCycling .
}
```
