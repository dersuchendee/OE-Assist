**No**

The ontology does not explicitly define the role of denitrifying bacteria in the denitrification process. While the ontology includes classes for DenitrificationProcess and DenitrifyingBacteria, and a property hasRole, it does not specify what the role is. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the denitrifying bacteria involved in the denitrification process, but not their specific role.

```sparql
SELECT ?bacteria
WHERE {
  ?process a :DenitrificationProcess .
  ?process :hasParticipant ?bacteria .
  ?bacteria a :DenitrifyingBacteria .
}
```
