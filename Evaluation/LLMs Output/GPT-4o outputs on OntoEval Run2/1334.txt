**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the relationships between beech forests, carbon and nitrogen cycling, and groundwater systems. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to model these relationships.

```sparql
SELECT ?beechForest ?cyclingProcess ?groundwaterSystem
WHERE {
  ?beechForest a :BeechForest .
  ?beechForest :affectsCycling ?cyclingProcess .
  ?cyclingProcess a ?cyclingType .
  FILTER (?cyclingType IN (:CarbonCycling, :NitrogenCycling))
  ?cyclingProcess :occursIn ?groundwaterSystem .
}
```
