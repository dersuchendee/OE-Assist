**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to connect hospitalisation rates to specific diseases or to determine when these rates are registered. The ontology includes classes for Disease, HospitalizationRate, and EnvironmentalFactor, but it lacks a direct connection to specific diseases or a way to query the registration date of hospitalisation rates related to a specific disease.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?hospitalizationRate ?registrationDate
WHERE {
  ?hospitalizationRate a :HospitalizationRate .
  ?hospitalizationRate :hasRegistrationDate ?registrationDate .
}
```
