**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying for contaminated sites within a geographical area and their recorded times, which are represented in the ontology. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?contaminatedSite ?siteLabel ?geographicalArea ?areaLabel ?observation ?recordedTime
WHERE {
  ?contaminatedSite a :ContaminatedSite .
  OPTIONAL { ?contaminatedSite rdfs:label ?siteLabel . }

  ?contaminatedSite :locatedIn ?geographicalArea .
  OPTIONAL { ?geographicalArea rdfs:label ?areaLabel . }

  ?contaminatedSite :hasObservation ?observation .
  ?observation :hasRecordedTime ?recordedTime .
}
ORDER BY ?geographicalArea ?recordedTime
```
