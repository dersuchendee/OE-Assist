**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about specific plays that can be seen during a theatre festival. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, locations, plays, productions, and other related concepts, but it does not explicitly link plays to specific theatre festivals.

To extract a partial answer, we can query for the plays associated with the "Roma Loves Shakespeare" festival, but this will not provide information about which plays can be seen during the festival.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  :Festival_RomaLovesShakespeare :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
```

This query will return the plays associated with the "Roma Loves Shakespeare" festival, but it does not specify which plays can be seen during the festival.
