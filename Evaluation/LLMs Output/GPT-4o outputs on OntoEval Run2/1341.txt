**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to identify a parameter that represents the quality of water bodies. The ontology defines a class `WaterQualityParameter` that is related to `WaterBody` through the property `representsQualityOf`, but it does not specify any instances or specific parameters that represent water quality. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the class `WaterQualityParameter`.

```sparql
SELECT ?parameter
WHERE {
  ?parameter a :WaterQualityParameter .
}
```
