**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to connect hospitals with the average number of admissions for a given diagnosis code. However, we can extract partial information about hospitals and their admission summaries.

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?diagnosisCode ?averageAdmissions
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Hospital .
  ?hospital :hasAdmissionSummary ?admissionSummary .
  ?admissionSummary :appliesToDiagnosisCode ?diagnosisCode .
  OPTIONAL { ?admissionSummary :averageAdmissions ?averageAdmissions . }
}
```
