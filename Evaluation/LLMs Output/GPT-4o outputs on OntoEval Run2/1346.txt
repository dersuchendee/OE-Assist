**No**

The ontology does not provide any information about distinct disease categories. However, we can extract a partial answer by querying for disease categories that are associated with diseases.

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?diseaseCategory
WHERE {
  ?disease a :Disease .
  ?disease :hasCategory ?diseaseCategory .
}
```
