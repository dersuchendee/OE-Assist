**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to connect measurements to specific geographic locations or areas. The CQ asks for the spatial distribution of chemical and physical measurements across different areas, but the ontology only defines a generic `locatedInArea` property without specific instances or connections to actual areas.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?measurement ?area
WHERE {
  ?measurement a :Measurement .
  ?measurement :locatedInArea ?area .
}
```
