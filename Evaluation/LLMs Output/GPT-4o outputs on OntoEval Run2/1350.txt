**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as it is possible to write a SPARQL query to extract the required information about physical parameters recorded at each monitoring point and how these measurements vary over time.

```sparql
SELECT ?monitoringPoint ?parameter ?time ?value
WHERE {
  ?measurement a :Measurement .
  ?measurement :monitoredAt ?monitoringPoint .
  ?measurement :measuresParameter ?parameter .
  ?measurement :hasTimestamp ?time .
  ?measurement :hasValue ?value .
}
ORDER BY ?monitoringPoint ?time
```
