**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the units of measure for chemical measurements in water. The ontology defines a class `ChemicalMeasurement` with a property `hasUnit` that relates to `UnitOfMeasure`, but there is no instance data or further specification of what these units are. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only extract partial information about the existence of the `hasUnit` property without specific unit details.

```sparql
SELECT ?chemicalMeasurement ?unit
WHERE {
  ?chemicalMeasurement a :ChemicalMeasurement .
  OPTIONAL { ?chemicalMeasurement :hasUnit ?unit . }
}
```
