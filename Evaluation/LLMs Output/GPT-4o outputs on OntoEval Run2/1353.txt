**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the parts of an organ at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to organs and their parts, but it lacks a direct representation of temporal information associated with the parts of an organ. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only extract partial information about the parts of an organ without considering the temporal aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?part
WHERE {
  ?organ a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
  ?organ <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/includesPart> ?part .
}
```
