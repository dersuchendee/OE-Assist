**No**

The ontology provided does not explicitly define a property or class that represents "original parts" of an organ. The ontology includes classes and properties related to parts of an organ, such as `Case`, `Console`, `Division`, `WindSystem`, and their respective components, but it does not specify which of these parts are original. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by listing all parts of an organ, as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?part
WHERE {
  ?organ a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
  ?organ <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/includesPart> ?part .
}
```

This query retrieves all parts included in an organ, but it does not distinguish between original and non-original parts.
