**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about specific plays that can be seen during a theatre festival. It only contains classes and properties related to theatre festivals, locations, dates, and other related entities, but not specific plays.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list the theatre festivals and their locations, but not the specific plays:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasLocation ?location .
  ?location :locationName ?locationName .
}
```
