**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct mention or property that connects resources to organs. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to organs using the available classes and properties.

```sparql
SELECT ?resource ?organ
WHERE {
  ?organ a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
  ?resource ?property ?organ .
}
```

This query attempts to find any resources that are related to organs through any property, but it may not directly answer the competency question as intended.
