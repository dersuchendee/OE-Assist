**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes related to the weight of a bell. Therefore, the competency question "Which is the weight of the bell?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial query can be constructed to retrieve information about bells, but it will not include their weight.

```sparql
SELECT ?bell
WHERE {
  ?bell a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/Bell> .
}
```
