**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes related to measurements of bells, such as their weight, dimensions, or material. Therefore, the competency question "Which are the measures of the bell?" cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, we can extract partial information about the bells and their relationships to other entities.

```sparql
SELECT ?bell ?bellLabel
WHERE {
  ?bell a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/Bell> .
  OPTIONAL { ?bell rdfs:label ?bellLabel . }
}
