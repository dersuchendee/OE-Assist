**No**

The ontology provided does not contain explicit information about the number of bells in a church or bell tower. However, it does have a class for `Bell` and `SetOfBells`, which could potentially be used to infer the number of bells if instances of these classes were available. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list the sets of bells associated with bell towers:

```sparql
SELECT ?bellTower ?setOfBells
WHERE {
  ?setOfBells a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/SetOfBells> .
  ?bell a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/Bell> .
  ?bell <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/isComponentOf> ?setOfBells .
  ?bellTower a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/BellTower> .
  ?setOfBells <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/hasComponent> ?bell .
}
```

This query will list the sets of bells and their associated bell towers, but it will not provide the count of bells in each set, as the ontology does not provide a direct way to count the number of bells in a set.
