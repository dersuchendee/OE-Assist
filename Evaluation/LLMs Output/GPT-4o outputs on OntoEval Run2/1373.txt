The competency question is answerable using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for `Bell`, `SetOfBells`, and `BellTower`, and the relationships between them. We can write a SPARQL query to determine if there is a single bell or a set of bells in a church/bell tower.

```sparql
SELECT ?bellTower ?bell ?setOfBells
WHERE {
  ?bellTower a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/BellTower> .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?bell a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/Bell> .
    ?bell <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/isComponentOf> ?setOfBells .
    ?setOfBells a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/SetOfBells> .
  }
}
```

This query retrieves bell towers and checks if there are any bells or sets of bells associated with them.
