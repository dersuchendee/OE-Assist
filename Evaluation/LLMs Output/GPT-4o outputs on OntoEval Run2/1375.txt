**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a musician with the places they visited. The ontology focuses on meetups, participants, and locations, but it does not explicitly link a musician to the places they visited outside of the context of a meetup. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on meetups and their locations:

```sparql
SELECT ?musician ?place
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasParticipant ?participant .
  ?participant rdfs:label ?musician .
  ?meetup mtps:hasPlace ?place .
}
```
