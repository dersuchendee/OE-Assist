**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the reason for a meeting. The `mtps:hasAPurpose` property connects a `Meetup` to a `Purpose`, but the ontology does not provide specific instances or data properties that describe the reason in detail. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information related to the purpose of a meetup:

```sparql
SELECT ?meetup ?purpose
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasAPurpose ?purpose .
}
```
