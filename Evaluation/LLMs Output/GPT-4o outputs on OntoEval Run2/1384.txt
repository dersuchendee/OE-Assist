**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to extract the places where the meetups took place. The ontology defines a `hasPlace` property that connects a `Meetup` to a `Location`, but there is no information about specific places or their details. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?meetup ?location
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasPlace ?location .
}
```
