**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to identify compositions as variants within a tune family. The ontology includes classes for `Tune`, `TuneFamily`, and properties like `core:hasSource`, but it lacks a specific property or class that directly relates compositions to their variant status within a tune family.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?tune ?tuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?tune a :Tune .
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
  # Assuming there might be some indirect way to relate tunes to tune families
  # but the ontology does not explicitly define this relationship
}
```
