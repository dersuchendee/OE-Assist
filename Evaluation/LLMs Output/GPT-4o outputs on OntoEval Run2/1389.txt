**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or relationships that directly connect a "TuneFamily" to "collections" or any other entities that could be considered collections. The ontology defines "TuneFamily" as a subclass of "core:Collection," but it does not provide any specific properties or relationships that would allow us to query for all collections within a tune family.

However, we can attempt to extract partial information about "TuneFamily" entities themselves, but this will not directly answer the competency question about collections within a tune family.

```sparql
SELECT ?tuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
}
```
