**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between theatre festivals and the plays that can be seen during them. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, and productions, but it lacks a direct property or relationship that connects a specific play to a specific theatre festival. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?play
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :featuresPlay ?play .
}
```

This query retrieves the plays featured in theatre festivals, but it does not specify which plays can be seen during a certain theatre festival, as the ontology does not provide a way to specify the time or location of the plays within the context of a festival.
