**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes that directly relate to similarity measures between tune families. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SPARQL query to fully answer the competency question. However, we can extract partial information about tune families.

```sparql
SELECT ?tuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
}
```
