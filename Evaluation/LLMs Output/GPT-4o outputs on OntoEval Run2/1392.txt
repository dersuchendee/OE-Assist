**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes that directly relate tunes to composers or to tune families. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SPARQL query to fully answer the competency question. However, we can extract partial information about tunes and tune families.

```sparql
SELECT ?tune ?tuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?tune a :Tune .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
    # Assuming there is a property that relates tunes to tune families, which is not present in the ontology
    # ?tune :isPartOf ?tuneFamily .
  }
}
```
