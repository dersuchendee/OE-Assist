**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate plays with specific theatre festivals. The ontology includes classes for TheatreFestival and Play, but there is no explicit relationship between them that would allow us to query which plays are part of a specific festival. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists the plays without associating them with a specific festival:

```sparql
SELECT ?play
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
}
```
