**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between theatres and cities, which is necessary to answer the competency question about the location of a theatre. However, there is partial information available about the location of some theatres. Here's a SPARQL query to extract this partial information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :locatedIn ?city .
}
```
