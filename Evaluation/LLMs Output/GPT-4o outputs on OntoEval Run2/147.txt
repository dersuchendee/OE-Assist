**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a theatre with a city. The ontology includes classes for `Cl_Theatre` and `Cl_City`, but there is no direct property linking a theatre to a city. The `locatedIn` property links `Cl_Building` to `Cl_City`, but `Cl_Theatre` is a subclass of `Cl_Building`, and there is no instance data provided to make this connection.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
}
```
