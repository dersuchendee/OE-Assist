**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a theatre with a specific city. While there is a `hasLocation` property that relates a theatre to a city, the ontology does not include instances or data that specify which theatre is located in which city. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Theatre .
  ?theatre :hasLocation ?city .
}
```
