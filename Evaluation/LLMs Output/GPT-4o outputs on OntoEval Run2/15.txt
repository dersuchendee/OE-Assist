The competency question "Who invented an instrument?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `MusicalInstrument` and the object property `inventedBy` which relates a musical instrument to its inventor, who is a `Person`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?instrument ?instrumentLabel ?inventor ?inventorLabel
WHERE {
  ?instrument a :MusicalInstrument .
  ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel .
  ?instrument :inventedBy ?inventor .
  ?inventor rdfs:label ?inventorLabel .
}
```
