**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct property or class that associates a theatre with a city. The closest property is `:isLocatedIn`, which associates a theatre with a city, but there is no instance data or specific property that directly answers the competency question. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the available data structure.

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :isLocatedIn ?city .
}
```
