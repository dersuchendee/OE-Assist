**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the city in which a theatre is located. The ontology includes a property `:isLocatedIn` that relates a theatre to a city, but there is no direct connection between a specific theatre and a city instance in the provided ontology. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre :isLocatedIn ?city . }
}
```
