**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the specific city in which a theatre is located. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Theatre` and a property `locatedIn` that links a theatre to a city, but there are no specific instances or data that provide the city for a given theatre. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre :locatedIn ?city . }
}
```
