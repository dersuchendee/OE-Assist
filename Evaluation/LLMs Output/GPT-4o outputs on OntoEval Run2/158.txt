**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the city in which a specific theatre is located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and actors, but it lacks a direct connection between a theatre and its city. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying theatres, but without their corresponding cities.

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?theatreName
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :theatreName ?theatreName .
}
```
