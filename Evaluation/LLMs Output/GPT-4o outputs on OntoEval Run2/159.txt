**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a theatre and its city location. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and actors, but it lacks a direct property or class that associates a theatre with a specific city. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :locatedIn ?location .
  ?location a :Cl_TheatreLocation .
  ?location :cityName ?city .
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve the city name for each theatre, but it relies on the assumption that such a relationship exists, which is not explicitly defined in the provided ontology.
