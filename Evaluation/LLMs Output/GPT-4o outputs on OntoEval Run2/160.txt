**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the city in which a specific theatre is located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and other related entities, but it lacks a direct connection between a theatre and its city. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?theatre :locatedIn ?city .
  }
}
```

This query attempts to find theatres and their associated cities, but without a direct connection in the ontology, it may not return complete results.
