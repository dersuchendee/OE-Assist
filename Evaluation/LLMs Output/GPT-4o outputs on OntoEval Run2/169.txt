The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate cities to countries, specifically through the `geo:locatedIn` property. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
PREFIX geo: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/geo#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a geo:City .
  ?city geo:locatedIn ?country .
}
```
