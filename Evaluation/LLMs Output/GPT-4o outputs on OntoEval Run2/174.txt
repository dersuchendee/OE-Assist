**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and a country, which is necessary to answer the competency question. However, we can extract a partial answer by identifying cities, but we cannot determine the country they are located in.

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
}
```
