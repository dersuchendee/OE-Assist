**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct relationship between a city and a country. Although there is a subclass relationship between `Cl_City` and `Cl_Country`, it does not specify which country a particular city is located in. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by listing the cities.

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
}
```
