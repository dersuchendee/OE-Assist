**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to extract the built date of an instrument realization. However, we can extract partial information about instrument realizations and their associated musical compositions.

```sparql
SELECT ?instrumentRealization ?composition
WHERE {
  ?composition :op_hasInstrumentRealization ?instrumentRealization .
}
```
