**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and the country it is located in. The `inCountry` property connects a city to a country, but there is no direct class or property that represents a city being located in a specific country. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract city and country information:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City ;
        :cityName ?cityName ;
        :inCountry ?country .
  ?country :countryName ?countryName .
}
```
