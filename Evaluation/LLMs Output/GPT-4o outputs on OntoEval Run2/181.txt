**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the country in which a city is located. It only provides information about cities and their relationships with other entities like theatres and festivals. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the cities present in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityName ?cityName .
}
```
