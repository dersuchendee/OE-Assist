**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between cities and countries, which is necessary to answer the competency question about the country in which a city is located. However, we can extract partial information about cities.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityName ?cityName .
}
```
