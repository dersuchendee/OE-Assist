**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about the countries in which cities are located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and locations, but it does not explicitly model the relationship between cities and countries. Therefore, the competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying cities mentioned in the ontology, but without the corresponding country information.

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
}
```
