**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and the country it is located in. The ontology includes a `:Cl_City` class with a `:isLocatedInCountry` data property, but there is no direct link between a city and a country in the ontology. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract cities and their countries:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedInCountry ?country .
}
```
