**No**

The ontology does not directly support querying which play is the basis of a production. The ontology includes a class `Cl_ProductionBasedOnPlay` and properties `basedOn` and `hasBasis`, but these are not directly connected to `Cl_Production` in a way that allows querying for the play a production is based on. The ontology would need a direct property connecting `Cl_Production` to `Cl_Play` to fully support this competency question.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production :hasBasis ?productionBasedOnPlay .
  ?productionBasedOnPlay :basedOn ?play .
}
```
