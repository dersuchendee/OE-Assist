**Yes**

The competency question "What play is the basis of this production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:Cl_Production` class and the `:basedOnPlay` object property, which links a production to a play. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :basedOnPlay ?play .
}
```
