**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct connection between a theatre production and the play it is based on. The ontology includes classes and properties related to plays, productions, and theatre festivals, but it lacks a specific property that directly links a production to the play it is based on. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_TheatreProduction .
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  # This is a placeholder for the missing direct relationship
  # ?production :isBasedOn ?play .
}
