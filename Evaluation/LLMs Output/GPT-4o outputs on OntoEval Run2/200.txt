The competency question "What play is the basis of this production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_TheatreProduction` and the object property `op_isBasedOnPlay` which links a theatre production to a play. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the play that is the basis of a given theatre production.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_TheatreProduction .
  ?production :op_isBasedOnPlay ?play .
}
```
