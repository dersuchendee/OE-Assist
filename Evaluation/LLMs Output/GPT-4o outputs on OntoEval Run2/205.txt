**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct connection between a production and the play it is based on. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Production` and a class `Cl_ProductionPlay`, but there is no direct property linking a specific production to a specific play. The `basedOnPlay` property connects `Cl_Production` to `Cl_ProductionPlay`, but without specific instances or data properties to identify the play, the competency question cannot be fully answered.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :basedOnPlay ?play .
}
```

This query will return the productions and the plays they are based on, but without specific play names or identifiers, it cannot fully answer the competency question.
