**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a production and the play it is based on. The ontology includes a `basedOnPlay` property, but it does not specify the play that serves as the basis for a production. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract productions and their associated plays:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :basedOnPlay ?play .
}
```
