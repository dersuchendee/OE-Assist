**Yes**

The competency question "What play is the basis of this production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Production` and the object property `isBasedOn` which connects a production to its base play (`Cl_ProductionBase`). The `playTitle` data property can be used to retrieve the title of the play that the production is based on.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :isBasedOn ?basePlay .
  ?basePlay :playTitle ?playTitle .
}
```
