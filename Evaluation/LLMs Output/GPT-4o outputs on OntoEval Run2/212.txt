**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate members of an ensemble with a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for ensembles, theatre productions, and performances, but it lacks a mechanism to specify the temporal membership of individuals in an ensemble. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract ensemble members without temporal information:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?memberName
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?member .
  ?member :hasName ?memberName .
}
```
