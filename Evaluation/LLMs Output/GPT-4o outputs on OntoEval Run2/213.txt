**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for ensemble members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre productions, actors, roles, and ensembles, but it lacks a direct representation of time-specific ensemble membership. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on ensemble members without the time aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?actor ?actorName
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?actor .
  ?actor :hasName ?actorName .
}
```
