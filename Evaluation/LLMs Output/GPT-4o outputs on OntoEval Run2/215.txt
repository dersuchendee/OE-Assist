**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate ensembles with specific points in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to ensembles, actors, and theatre productions, but it lacks a mechanism to specify the temporal aspect of ensemble membership. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract ensemble members without the temporal aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a theatre:Ensemble .
  ?ensemble theatre:hasMember ?member .
}
```
