The competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to connect members to ensembles and specify the time of membership. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?time
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership .
  ?membership :ensembleInMembership ?ensemble .
  ?membership :memberInMembership ?member .
  ?membership :atTime ?time .
}
```
