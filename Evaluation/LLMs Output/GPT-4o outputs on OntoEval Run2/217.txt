**Yes**

The competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for ensemble memberships, actors, and the time intervals during which these memberships are valid.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?actor ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :EnsembleMembership .
  ?membership :ensemble ?ensemble .
  ?membership :member ?actor .
  ?membership :during ?timeInterval .
  ?timeInterval :hasStartDate ?startDate .
  ?timeInterval :hasEndDate ?endDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the ensemble, actor, and the start and end dates of the time interval during which the actor is a member of the ensemble.
