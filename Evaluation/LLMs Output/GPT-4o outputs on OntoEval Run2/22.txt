**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate water bodies with specific water basins through a property or class that directly answers the competency question. The ontology includes classes and properties related to water bodies and basins, but the relationship between a specific water body and a specific water basin is not explicitly defined in a way that can be queried directly.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?waterBody ?waterBasin
WHERE {
  ?waterBody a :Cl_WaterBody .
  ?waterBody :op_belongsTo ?waterBasin .
}
```
