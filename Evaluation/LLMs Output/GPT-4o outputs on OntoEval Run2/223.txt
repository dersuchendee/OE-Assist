**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the members of an ensemble at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to ensembles, actors, and their memberships, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific ensemble and a point in time that would allow for querying ensemble members at a specific time.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists ensemble members and their membership periods:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?actor ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble rdf:type :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?actor :op_hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :op_membershipIn ?ensemble .
  ?membership :dp_startDate ?startDate .
  ?membership :dp_endDate ?endDate .
}
```
