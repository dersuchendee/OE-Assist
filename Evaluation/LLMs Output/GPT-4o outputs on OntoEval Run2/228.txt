**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to associate an ensemble with its members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and actors, but it lacks a direct representation of ensembles and their members at specific times. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying ensembles and their members, but not at a specific point in time.

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?memberName
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership .
  ?membership :actorName ?memberName .
}
```
