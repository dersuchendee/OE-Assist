**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the members of an ensemble at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between ensemble membership and specific time periods.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?memberName ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership :memberName ?memberName .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
}
```
