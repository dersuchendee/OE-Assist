**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to ensembles or their members. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SPARQL query to fully answer the competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" based on the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for any ensemble-related data that might be present, but this will not provide the specific information about ensemble members at a certain point in time.

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
}
```
