**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the members of an ensemble at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to ensembles and memberships, but it lacks a direct connection between ensemble memberships and specific points in time that would allow for querying the members of an ensemble at a specific time.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership :member ?member .
}
```
