**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate plays with their authors. The ontology includes classes and properties related to plays, productions, and authors, but it lacks a direct connection between a play and its author. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only provide partial information about plays without specifying their authors.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?title
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :dp_title ?title .
}
```
