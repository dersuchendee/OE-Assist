**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct relationships or properties that connect authors to the plays they have written. The ontology includes classes and properties related to plays, productions, festivals, and various roles and events, but it lacks a direct way to associate an author with a play. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying plays and their associated writing events, but without linking them to specific authors.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?writingEvent
WHERE {
  ?writingEvent a :Cl_WritingEvent .
  ?writingEvent :hasPlay ?play .
}
```
