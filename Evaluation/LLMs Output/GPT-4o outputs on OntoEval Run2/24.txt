The competency question "What types of water bodies can be listed?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology defines various classes of water bodies, including coastal and inland water bodies, and their specific types. A SPARQL query can be written to extract the list of all water body types.

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?waterBodyType
WHERE {
  ?waterBodyType rdfs:subClassOf :Cl_WaterBody .
}
```
