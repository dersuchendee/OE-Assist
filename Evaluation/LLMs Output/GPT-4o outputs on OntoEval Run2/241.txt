The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate authors to plays, specifically through the `:wrotePlay` and `:hasAuthor` object properties. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?authorName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  ?author :wrotePlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
}
ORDER BY ?author ?play
```

This query retrieves authors and the plays they have written, along with optional labels for both authors and plays.
