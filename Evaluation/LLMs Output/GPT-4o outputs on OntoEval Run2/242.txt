**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct relationship between authors and the plays they have written. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, cities, plays, theatres, actors, ensembles, authors, newspapers, productions, and other related concepts. However, there is no explicit property that connects an author directly to the plays they have written.

To extract a partial answer, we can query for authors and plays, but without a direct connection, the query will not provide the specific plays written by each author.

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?play
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
}
```

This query will list all authors and plays, but it will not establish which plays were written by which authors.
