**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link a product to its manufacturer. However, we can extract partial information about products and actors involved in processes, but not specifically the manufacturer.

```sparql
SELECT ?product ?actor
WHERE {
  ?process a process:ManufacturingProcess .
  ?process process:resultingProduct ?product .
  ?participation a actor:ProcessParticipation .
  ?participation actorODP:participationIn ?process .
  ?participation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
}
```
