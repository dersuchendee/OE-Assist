**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about authors or the plays they have written. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about plays and their names.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
```
