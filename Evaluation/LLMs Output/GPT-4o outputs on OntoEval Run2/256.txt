**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about authors and the plays they have written. The ontology primarily focuses on theatre festivals, productions, and related entities, but it does not include a class or property that directly associates an author with the plays they have written. Therefore, the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying plays and their titles, but without linking them to specific authors.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :playTitle ?playTitle .
}
```
