The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to determine the production period during which a play was written. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  
  ?play :writtenDuring ?productionPeriod .
  
  ?productionPeriod :hasStartDate ?startDate .
  ?productionPeriod :hasEndDate ?endDate .
}
```
