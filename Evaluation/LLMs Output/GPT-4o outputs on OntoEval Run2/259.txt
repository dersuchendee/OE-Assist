The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate plays to their writing periods, including start and end years. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the writing period for a specific play:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?title ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :dp_title ?title ;
        :op_hasWritingPeriod ?writingPeriod .
  ?writingPeriod :dp_startYear ?startYear ;
                 :dp_endYear ?endYear .
}
```
