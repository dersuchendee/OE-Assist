**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the time period during which a play was written. The ontology includes classes and properties related to plays, theatre productions, festivals, and other related concepts, but it lacks specific properties or data that would allow us to extract the time period of a play's writing.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information about plays:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
}
```
