**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the time period during which a play was written. The ontology includes a `writtenDuring` property for the `Cl_Play` class, but it is a datatype property with a range of `xsd:string`, which does not provide a structured way to query for a specific time period. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?writtenDuring
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?writtenDuring .
}
```
