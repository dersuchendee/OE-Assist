**Yes**

The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:writtenDuring` data property, which is associated with the `:Cl_Play` class. This property can be used to retrieve the time period during which a play was written.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?title ?writtenDuring
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :hasTitle ?title ;
        :writtenDuring ?writtenDuring .
}
```

This query retrieves the play, its title, and the time period during which it was written, which directly answers the competency question.
