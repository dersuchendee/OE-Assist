The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `Cl_Play` class with the properties `dp_writtenStartDate` and `dp_writtenEndDate`, which specify the time period during which a play was written. Here's a SPARQL query to extract this information:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?writtenStartDate ?writtenEndDate
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :dp_writtenStartDate ?writtenStartDate .
  ?play :dp_writtenEndDate ?writtenEndDate .
}
```
