**Yes**

The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:writtenDuring` property that connects a play to a time period, which is exactly what is needed to answer the CQ.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?timePeriodResource .
  ?timePeriodResource :timePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
```
