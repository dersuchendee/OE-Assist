**Yes**

The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_PlayCreation` which is a subclass of both `Cl_Play` and `Cl_TimePeriod`, and the object property `writtenDuring` which connects a play to its creation time period. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?creation .
  ?creation a :Cl_PlayCreation .
  ?creation :timePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
```
