The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:writtenDuring` object property that connects a `:Cl_Play` to a `:Cl_TimePeriod`, and the `:timePeriodValue` data property that provides the time period as a string. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?timePeriodNode .
  ?timePeriodNode :timePeriodValue ?timePeriod .
}
```
