**Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology provides a reification class `Cl_ActorRole` that connects actors, roles, and material flows. This allows us to query the roles of an actor in the network.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role
WHERE {
  ?actorRole a :Cl_ActorRole .
  ?actorRole :actorInNetwork ?actor .
  ?actorRole :roleInNetwork ?role .
}
```
