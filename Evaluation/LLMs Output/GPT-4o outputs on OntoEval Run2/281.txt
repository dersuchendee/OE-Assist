The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a `:numberOfActs` datatype property that specifies the total number of acts a play contains. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  ?play :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```
