**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the number of acts a particular play contains. The ontology includes classes and properties related to plays, productions, and other theatre-related concepts, but it lacks a direct connection between a play and its act count. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?actCount
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasActCount ?actCount . }
}
```
