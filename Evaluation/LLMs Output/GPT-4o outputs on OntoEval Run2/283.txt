The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `ns1:numberOfActs` property, which specifies the number of acts a play contains. We can write a SPARQL query to extract this information for a specific play.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a ns1:Play .
  ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel .
  ?play ns1:numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```
