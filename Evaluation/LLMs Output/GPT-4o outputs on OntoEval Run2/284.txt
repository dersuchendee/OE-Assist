**Yes**

The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the `theatre:Play` class and the `theatre:hasNumberOfActs` datatype property, which allows us to query the number of acts for a specific play. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a theatre:Play .
  ?play theatre:hasNumberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```
