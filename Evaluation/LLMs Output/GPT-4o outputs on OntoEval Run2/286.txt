The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the classes `Play` and `Act`, and the object property `hasAct` which relates a play to its acts. We can write a SPARQL query to count the number of acts for a specific play.

```sparql
SELECT ?play (COUNT(?act) AS ?numberOfActs)
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  ?play :hasAct ?act .
}
GROUP BY ?play
```
