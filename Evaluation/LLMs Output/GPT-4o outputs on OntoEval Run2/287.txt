**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the number of acts in a play. However, we can extract partial information about plays and their associated productions.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName ?actCount
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?play :actCount ?actCount . }
}
```
