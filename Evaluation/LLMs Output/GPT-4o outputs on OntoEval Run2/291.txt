**Yes**

The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:containsActs` data property, which specifies the number of acts for each play. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the number of acts for a particular play:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?title ?acts
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :hasTitle ?title ;
        :containsActs ?acts .
}
```

This query retrieves the play, its title, and the number of acts it contains, allowing us to answer the competency question.
