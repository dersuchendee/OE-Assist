The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:hasNumberOfActs` datatype property, which is associated with the `:Cl_Play` class. This property allows us to retrieve the number of acts for a specific play.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the number of acts for a particular play:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :hasNumberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```

This query will return the number of acts for each play defined in the ontology. If you want to find the number of acts for a specific play, you can add a filter condition to the query, such as `FILTER(?play = :MerchantOfVenice)`.
