**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about the number of acts in a play. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and other related entities, but it does not specify the number of acts a play contains. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying plays within the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
}
```

This query retrieves the plays and their names, but it does not provide information about the number of acts, as that information is not present in the ontology.
