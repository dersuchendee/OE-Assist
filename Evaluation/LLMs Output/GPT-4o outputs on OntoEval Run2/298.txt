**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about the number of acts in a play. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and other related concepts, but it does not have a property or class that specifies the number of acts in a play. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists the plays without specifying the number of acts:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
}
```
