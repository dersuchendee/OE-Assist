**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the credibility of a source as a single value or attribute. The ontology includes classes and properties related to credibility assessments, experts, and facts, but it does not define a direct property or attribute for the overall credibility of a source. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the credibility assessments associated with a source.

```sparql
SELECT ?source ?credibilityScore ?credibilityExplanation
WHERE {
  ?source a :Source .
  ?source :hasCredibilityAssessment ?assessment .
  ?assessment :hasCredibilityScore ?credibilityScore .
  OPTIONAL { ?assessment :hasCredibilityExplanation ?credibilityExplanation . }
}
```
