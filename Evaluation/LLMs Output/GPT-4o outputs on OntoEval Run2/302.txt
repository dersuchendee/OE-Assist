**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about the number of acts in a play. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and other related concepts, but it does not have a class or property that directly represents the number of acts in a play. Therefore, the competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying plays within the ontology, but without the number of acts:

```sparql
SELECT ?play
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
}
```

This query will return all instances of plays in the ontology, but it will not provide the number of acts for each play, as that information is not present in the ontology.
