**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific date with the premier of a production. While there is a class `Cl_PremierEvent` and a property `premierDate`, there is no direct connection between a specific production and its premier date in the provided ontology. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying productions that have a premier event, but without the specific date.

```sparql
SELECT ?production
WHERE {
  ?premierEvent a :Cl_PremierEvent .
  ?premierEvent :productionOf ?production .
}
```
