**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to trace who viewed a product. However, we can extract partial information about actors and their roles related to resources, which might include viewing.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role
WHERE {
  ?relation a :ViewingResource .
  ?relation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  ?relation actorODP:participantRole ?role .
}
```
