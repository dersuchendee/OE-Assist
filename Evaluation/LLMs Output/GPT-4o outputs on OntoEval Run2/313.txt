**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the premier date of a specific production. The ontology includes a class `Cl_ProductionPremier` with a property `hasPremierDate`, but there is no direct connection between a specific production and its premier date. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for all productions with their premier dates, but it cannot be filtered for a specific production.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_ProductionPremier .
  ?production :hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
