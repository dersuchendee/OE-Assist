The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about productions and their premieres, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the premiere date of a specific production.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the premiere date of a specific production:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premiereDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremiere ?premiere .
  ?premiere :premiereDate ?premiereDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the production and its corresponding premiere date from the ontology.
