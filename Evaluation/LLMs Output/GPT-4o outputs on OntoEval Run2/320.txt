**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the premier date of a specific production. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and their premiers, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific production and its premier date. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
