The competency question asks for the "star rating" given by a certain newspaper for a certain production. The ontology contains information about reviews and ratings, but it does not explicitly connect a newspaper to a specific production through a review. The ontology does have a class `Cl_ReviewRating` and a property `:reviews` that connects a newspaper to a review rating, but it does not directly connect this to a specific production.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which retrieves the star rating for a production, but without specifying the newspaper:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?reviewRating a :Cl_ReviewRating ;
                :concerns ?production ;
                :hasStarRating ?starRating .
}
```
