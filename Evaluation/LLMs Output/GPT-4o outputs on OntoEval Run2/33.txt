**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to extract the actors involved in a process. The ontology defines classes and properties related to actors, capabilities, and participation, but it does not explicitly link actors to specific processes. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on actors and their participation:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?participation
WHERE {
  ?participation a :Participation .
  ?participation :participatingActor ?actor .
}
```
