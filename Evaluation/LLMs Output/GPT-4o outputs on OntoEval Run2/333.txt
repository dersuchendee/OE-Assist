The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the "star rating" given by a certain newspaper for a certain production. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre productions, reviews, and star ratings, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific newspaper and its review of a specific production. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the available information about reviews and star ratings:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?review ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_Review .
  ?review :forProduction ?production .
  ?review :hasStarRating ?starRating .
}
```
