**No**

The ontology does not contain any properties or classes that directly relate to a "star rating" given by a newspaper for a production. The closest match is the `:hasStarRating` property, but it is associated with `:Cl_NewspaperReview`, which is not directly linked to a specific newspaper or production in the ontology. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for newspaper reviews and their star ratings, but it will not specify the newspaper or production.

```sparql
SELECT ?newspaperReview ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?newspaperReview a :Cl_NewspaperReview .
  ?newspaperReview :hasStarRating ?starRating .
}
```
