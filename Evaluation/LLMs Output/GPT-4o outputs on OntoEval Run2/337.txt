The ontology provided does not contain any information about star ratings given by newspapers for productions. The ontology includes classes and properties related to festivals, plays, theatres, productions, ensembles, individuals, authors, newspapers, reviews, employments, roles, and role assignments, but it does not include any specific properties or relationships that would allow us to query for a star rating given by a newspaper for a production.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list the reviews and their associated newspapers, but it will not provide the star rating as the ontology does not support this:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?review ?newspaper
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :reviewedBy ?newspaper .
}
```
