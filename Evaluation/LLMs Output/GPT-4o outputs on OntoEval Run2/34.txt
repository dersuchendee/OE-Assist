**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the CVNs an actor is participating in. However, we can extract partial information about actors and their roles in CVNs.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?cvn
WHERE {
  ?participation a actor:CVNParticipation .
  ?participation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  ?participation actorODP:participationIn ?cvn .
}
```
