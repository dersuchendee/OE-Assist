**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about newspapers or star ratings for productions. However, we can extract partial information about productions and their premieres.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premiereDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremiere ?premiere .
  ?premiere :premiereDate ?premiereDate .
}
```
