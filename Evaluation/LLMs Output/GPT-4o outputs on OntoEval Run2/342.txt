The competency question "What is the “star rating” given by a certain newspaper for a certain production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate newspapers, productions, and star ratings, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the desired information.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the star rating given by a certain newspaper for a certain production:

```sparql
SELECT ?newspaperName ?productionName ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_Review ;
          :hasNewspaper ?newspaper ;
          :hasProduction ?production ;
          :hasStarRating ?starRating .
  ?newspaper :newspaperName ?newspaperName .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
}
```

This query retrieves the names of newspapers, the names of productions, and the corresponding star ratings from the ontology.
