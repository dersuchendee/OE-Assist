**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to newspapers or reviews, which are necessary to answer the competency question about the "star rating" given by a certain newspaper for a certain production. Therefore, the competency question is not fully supported by the ontology. However, we can extract partial information about productions.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :isBasedOn ?productionBase .
  ?productionBase :playTitle ?playTitle .
}
```
