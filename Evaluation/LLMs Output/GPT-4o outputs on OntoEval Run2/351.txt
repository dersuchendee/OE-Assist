**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the start time of an actor's employment at a specific theatre. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, theatres, and employment periods, but it lacks a direct connection between an actor, a specific theatre, and the start time of employment. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :op_hasEmploymentPeriod ?employmentPeriod .
  ?employmentPeriod :op_employmentIn ?theatre .
  ?employmentPeriod :dp_startDate ?startDate .
}
```
