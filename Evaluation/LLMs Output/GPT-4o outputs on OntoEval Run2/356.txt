**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the start date of an actor's employment with a specific theatre. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre productions, festivals, plays, and actors, but it lacks a direct connection between an actor and their employment start date at a specific theatre. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :hasActor ?actor .
  ?employment :hasTheatre ?theatre .
  ?employment :startDate ?startDate .
}
```
