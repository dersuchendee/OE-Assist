**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about actors working for a specific theatre or the start date of their employment. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, ensembles, and actor roles, but it lacks the necessary details to answer the competency question regarding the employment start date of an actor at a specific theatre.

Partial SPARQL query to extract related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment .
  ?employment :employedActor ?actor .
  ?employment :atTheatre ?theatre .
  ?employment :startDate ?startDate .
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve actors, theatres, and start dates of employment, but without specific instances or data in the ontology, it cannot provide a complete answer to the competency question.
