**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about the specific time an actor started working for a specific theatre. The ontology includes information about employment start dates, but it does not directly link an actor to a specific theatre with a start date. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract employment start dates for individuals:

```sparql
SELECT ?individual ?name ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?individual a :Cl_Individual ;
              :hasName ?name ;
              :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
}
```
