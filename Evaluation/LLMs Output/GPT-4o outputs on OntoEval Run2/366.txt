**Yes**

The competency question "At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_ActorEmployment` which is a subclass of `Cl_Actor`, `Cl_Theatre`, and `Cl_Date`, and it has a data property `employmentStartDate` that can be used to determine when an actor started working at a theatre.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?actorName ?theatreName ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment .
  ?employment :actorName ?actorName .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  ?employment :theatreName ?theatreName .
}
```
