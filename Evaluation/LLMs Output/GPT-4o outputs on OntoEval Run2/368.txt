**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about actors, theatres, or employment start dates. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for any employment-related data that might exist, even though it is not explicitly modeled in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?actor :isEmployedAt ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
}
```
