The competency question "What are the actors involved in the process?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines a `Process` class that involves `Actor` instances through the `involvesActor` property. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the actors involved in each process.

```sparql
SELECT ?process ?actor
WHERE {
  ?process a :Process .
  ?process :involvesActor ?actor .
}
```
