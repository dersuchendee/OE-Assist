**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the roles a person has within a production at a specific time, which can be extracted using the reified class `Cl_PersonRoleInProduction`. Here's the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?role ?production ?productionTitle ?time
WHERE {
  ?personRoleInProduction a :Cl_PersonRoleInProduction .
  
  ?personRoleInProduction :hasPersonRoleInProduction ?person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person :hasName ?personName . }
  
  ?personRoleInProduction :withRole ?role .
  
  ?personRoleInProduction :inProduction ?production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production :hasTitle ?productionTitle . }
  
  ?personRoleInProduction :atTime ?time .
  
  # Filter for a specific person, production, and time if needed
  # FILTER(?person = <specific_person_URI> && ?production = <specific_production_URI> && ?time = <specific_time>)
}
ORDER BY ?person ?production ?time
```
