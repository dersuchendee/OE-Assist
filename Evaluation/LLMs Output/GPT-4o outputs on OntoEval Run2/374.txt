**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the roles a person has within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to people, roles, productions, and time, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements that would allow for querying roles at specific times.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the roles a person has within a production, without the time aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?role ?roleName ?production ?productionTitle
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasName ?personName .
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :hasRoleName ?roleName .
  ?person :participatesIn ?production .
  ?production :hasTitle ?productionTitle .
}
```

This query retrieves the roles a person has within a production, but it does not include the temporal aspect due to the lack of a direct connection in the ontology.
