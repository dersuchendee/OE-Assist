**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for roles, productions, and time-indexed roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and the specific production they are involved in at a given time.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?production ?time
WHERE {
  ?person a ns1:Person .
  ?person ns1:hasTimeIndexedRole ?timeIndexedRole .
  ?timeIndexedRole ns1:hasRole ?role .
  ?role ns1:inProduction ?production .
  ?timeIndexedRole ns1:atTime ?time .
}
```
