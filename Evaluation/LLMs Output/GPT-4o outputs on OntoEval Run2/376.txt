**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate roles with specific productions and time points. However, we can extract partial information about actors and their participation in productions.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel ?production ?productionLabel
WHERE {
  ?actor a theatre:Actor .
  ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel .
  ?actor theatre:participatesIn ?production .
  ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel .
}
```
