**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a theatre production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to roles, role assignments, and time intervals, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, a role, and a production at a specific time. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the available data, but it will not fully satisfy the competency question.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?production
WHERE {
  ?roleAssignment a :RoleAssignment .
  ?roleAssignment :assignedPerson ?person .
  ?roleAssignment :assignedRole ?role .
  ?roleAssignment :inProduction ?production .
}
```
