**No**

The ontology provided does not have explicit classes or properties that directly relate to roles, persons, productions, and time in a way that would allow us to answer the competency question. The ontology does not have a clear representation of roles within a production or a way to associate a person with a specific role at a specific time within a production.

However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to productions and roles, but it will not fully answer the competency question as it lacks the temporal aspect and specific role assignments.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?production ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?role a :Cl_Role .
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
  ?person :partOf ?production .
}
```
