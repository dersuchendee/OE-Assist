**Yes**

The competency question "What roles does a certain person have within a certain production at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for actors, their roles, the productions they are part of, and the dates associated with these roles. Here's a SPARQL query that can be used to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role ?production ?roleDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :hasRole ?actorRole .
  ?actorRole a :Cl_ActorRole .
  ?actorRole :hasRoleInProduction ?production .
  ?actorRole :hasRoleDate ?roleDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the actor, their role, the production they are involved in, and the date of the role, which aligns with the competency question.
