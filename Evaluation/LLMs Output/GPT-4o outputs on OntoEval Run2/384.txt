**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about roles that a person has within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to festivals, plays, theatres, ensembles, individuals, and roles, but it lacks the necessary connections to link a person to a specific role within a production at a certain time.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists individuals and their roles, but without the specific production and time information:

```sparql
SELECT ?individual ?individualName ?role ?roleName
WHERE {
  ?individual a :Cl_Individual .
  ?individual :hasName ?individualName .
  ?individual :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
}
```
