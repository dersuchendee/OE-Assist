**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with specific roles within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for roles and role assignments, but it lacks the necessary connections to link these roles to specific productions and time points. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role ?production
WHERE {
  ?roleAssignment :op_roleOf ?actor .
  ?roleAssignment :op_hasRole ?role .
  ?roleAssignment :op_roleInProduction ?production .
}
```
