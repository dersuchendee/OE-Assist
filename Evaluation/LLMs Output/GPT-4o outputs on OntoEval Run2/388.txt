**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, roles, productions, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and the specific production and time period. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the available information, but it will not fully answer the competency question.

```sparql
SELECT ?actorName ?roleName ?productionName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?actorRole a :Cl_ActorRole ;
             :hasRole ?role ;
             :roleInProduction ?production ;
             :roleTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
  ?timePeriod :timePeriod ?timePeriodValue .
  ?actor :hasRole ?actorRole ;
         :actorName ?actorName .
}
```
