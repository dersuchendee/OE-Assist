**No**

The ontology provided does not include any information about roles that a person might have within a production. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, ensembles, actors, and their memberships, but it lacks specific details about roles within a production.

To extract a partial answer, we can query for the ensemble memberships and the productions they are associated with, but this will not provide specific roles.

```sparql
SELECT ?actorName ?productionName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?ensembleMembership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership ;
                      :hasMember ?actor ;
                      :hasEnsemble ?ensemble ;
                      :hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
  ?productionPlay :hasEnsemble ?ensemble ;
                  :hasProduction ?production .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
}
```
