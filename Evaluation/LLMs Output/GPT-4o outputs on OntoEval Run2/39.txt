**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for actors holding specific information. However, we can extract a partial answer by identifying actors and their capabilities, which might imply the type of information they hold.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?capability
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Actor .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?capability a :Capability .
    ?capability :capabilityOf ?actor .
  }
}
```
