**No**

The ontology provided does not include any classes or properties that directly relate to roles, specific productions, or time points within a production. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying actors and their roles, but without the context of a specific production or time.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?role ?roleName
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
  ?actor :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
}
```
