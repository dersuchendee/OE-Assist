**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and the time period within a specific production.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the roles associated with a person and a production:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?production
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasRole ?personRole .
  ?personRole a :Cl_PersonRole .
  ?personRole :roleName ?role .
  ?personRole :roleDate ?roleDate .
  ?personRole :basedOnPlay ?production .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, their role, and the production they are associated with, but it does not include the specific point in time for the role within the production.
