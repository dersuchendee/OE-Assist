**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to roles, persons, or productions in a way that would allow us to answer the competency question about the roles a person has within a production at a certain point in time. The ontology primarily focuses on theatre festivals, locations, plays, and related metadata, but lacks the necessary structure to represent roles and their assignments to individuals within productions.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information related to productions:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :isBasedOn ?productionBase .
  ?productionBase :playTitle ?playTitle .
}
```
