**Yes**

The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Production` with a restriction that specifies it has exactly one `hasPremierEvent`. This aligns with the competency question.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremierEvent ?premierEvent .
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premierEvent) = 1)
```
