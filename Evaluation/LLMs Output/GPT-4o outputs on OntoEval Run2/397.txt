**Yes**

The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `:Production` class that ensures each production is associated with exactly one premiere. This can be verified using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premiere
WHERE {
  ?production a :Production .
  ?production :hasPremiere ?premiere .
}
```
