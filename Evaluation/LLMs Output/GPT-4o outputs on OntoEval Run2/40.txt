The competency question "What is the type of this actor?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `actorODP:actorType` object property, which relates an `actorODP:Actor` to an `actorODP:ActorType`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the type of a given actor.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorType
WHERE {
  ?actor a actorODP:Actor .
  ?actor actorODP:actorType ?actorType .
}
```
