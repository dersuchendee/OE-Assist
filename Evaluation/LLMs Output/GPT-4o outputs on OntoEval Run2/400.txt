The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `theatre:ProductionWithOnePremier`, which is defined as a subclass of `theatre:Production` with a restriction that it has exactly one `theatre:Premier`. This allows us to query for productions that have exactly one premier.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract productions with exactly one premier:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?premier ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a theatre:ProductionWithOnePremier .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
  ?production theatre:hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier theatre:hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
