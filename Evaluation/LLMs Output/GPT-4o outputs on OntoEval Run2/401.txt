**Yes**

The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Production` with a restriction that specifies it must have exactly one `Cl_Premier`. This can be queried using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?production
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)
```

This query retrieves productions that have exactly one premier, satisfying the competency question.
