The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology defines a class `Cl_Production` with an object property `hasPremier` that has a cardinality constraint of 1, meaning each production has exactly one premier. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the productions and their premiers:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premier
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
}
```
