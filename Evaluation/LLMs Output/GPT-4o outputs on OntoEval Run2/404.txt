**Yes**

The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_ProductionPremier` and the property `hasPremier`, which connects a `Cl_Production` to a `Cl_ProductionPremier`. This allows us to query for productions that have exactly one premier.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?production :hasPremier ?otherPremier .
    FILTER(?otherPremier != ?premier)
  }
}
```

This query selects productions that have a premier and ensures that there is no other distinct premier associated with the same production, thus confirming that the production has exactly one premier.
