**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model the concept of a "premier" for a production. While there is a class `Cl_ProductionPremier` and a property `hasPremierDate`, there is no explicit restriction or cardinality constraint that enforces a production to have exactly one premier. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract productions with their premier dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_ProductionPremier .
  ?production :hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
