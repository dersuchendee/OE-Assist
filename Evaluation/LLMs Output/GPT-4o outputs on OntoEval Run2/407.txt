The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Production` with a restriction on the `premierDate` property, ensuring that each production has exactly one premier date. This aligns with the competency question.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the productions and their premier dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
