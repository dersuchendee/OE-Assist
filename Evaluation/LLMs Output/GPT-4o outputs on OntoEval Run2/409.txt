The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Production` and the object property `hasPremier` which links a production to a `Cl_PremierEvent`. The `Cl_PremierEvent` class has a data property `premierDate` which specifies the date of the premier. The ontology structure allows us to query for productions and their associated premier events, ensuring that each production has exactly one premier.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premier ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier a :Cl_PremierEvent .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
