**No**

The ontology provided does not explicitly model the concept of a "premier" for a production as having exactly one occurrence. While there is a class `Cl_ProductionPremier` and an object property `hasPremier`, there is no restriction or cardinality constraint that enforces a production to have exactly one premier. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract productions with their premiers:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
