**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with the instruments they play. The `playsInstrument` property is defined, but there is no data or reification class that connects a person to an instrument through this property. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}
```
