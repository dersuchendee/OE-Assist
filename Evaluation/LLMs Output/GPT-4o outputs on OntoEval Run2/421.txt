**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model the relationship between a person and the instruments they play. The ontology includes classes and properties related to musical groups, albums, tracks, and performances, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the instruments they play. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.
