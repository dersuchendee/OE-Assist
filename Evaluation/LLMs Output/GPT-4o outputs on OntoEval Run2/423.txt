**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a musician with the instruments they play. The ontology defines a `plays` property that connects a `Musician` to an `Instrument`, but it does not specify which instruments a specific musician plays. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by listing musicians and the instruments they are associated with, if any.

```sparql
SELECT ?musician ?musicianLabel ?instrument ?instrumentLabel
WHERE {
  ?musician a :Musician .
  OPTIONAL { ?musician rdfs:label ?musicianLabel . }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?musician :plays ?instrument .
    OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }
  }
}
```
