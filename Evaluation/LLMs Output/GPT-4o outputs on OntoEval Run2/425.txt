**Yes**

The competency question "What instruments does a certain person play?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `playsInstrument` property that relates a `Person` to a `MusicalInstrument`. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?instrument ?instrumentName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person ;
          :personName ?personName ;
          :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  ?instrument a :MusicalInstrument ;
              :instrumentName ?instrumentName .
}
ORDER BY ?personName ?instrumentName
```

This query retrieves the names of persons and the instruments they play, which directly answers the competency question.
