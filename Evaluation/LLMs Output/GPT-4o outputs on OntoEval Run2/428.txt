**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with the instruments they play. The ontology defines a class `Cl_InstrumentPlaying` that is a subclass of both `Cl_Person` and `Cl_Instrument`, but it does not provide a direct property to link a person to the instruments they play. The `playsInstrument` and `playedBy` properties are defined, but they are not used in a way that allows us to query which instruments a person plays.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list the `Cl_InstrumentPlaying` instances, but it won't directly answer the CQ:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?instrumentPlaying
WHERE {
  ?instrumentPlaying a :Cl_InstrumentPlaying .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrumentPlaying .
}
```
