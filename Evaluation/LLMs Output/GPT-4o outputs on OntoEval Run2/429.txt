**No**

The ontology provided does not directly support the competency question "What instruments does a certain person play?" because there is no direct connection between a person and the instruments they play. The ontology includes classes and properties related to band membership, roles, and performances, but it lacks a direct representation of the relationship between a person and the instruments they play.

However, we can extract a partial answer by identifying the people and their roles in bands, which might imply the instruments they play, but this is not explicitly modeled in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role
WHERE {
  ?bandRole a :Cl_BandRole .
  ?bandRole :hasRoleInBand ?person .
  ?bandRole :hasRole ?role .
}
```
