The competency question "What instruments does a certain person play?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for `Cl_Person`, `Cl_Instrument`, and `Cl_PersonInstrument`, along with the properties `plays` and `playedBy` that connect these classes. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?personInstrument a :Cl_PersonInstrument ;
                    :playedBy ?person ;
                    :plays ?instrument .
}
```
