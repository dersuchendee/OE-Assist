**No**

The ontology does not explicitly define a relationship between actors and competencies. However, it does define a relationship between actors and capabilities through the `actorODP:capabilityOf` property. Therefore, we can extract a partial answer by querying for actors and their capabilities.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?capability
WHERE {
  ?capability a actorODP:Capability .
  ?capability actorODP:capabilityOf ?actor .
}
```
