**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with the instruments they play. The ontology defines a `playsInstrument` property, but it is not connected to any specific individuals or instances of `Cl_Person` and `Cl_Instrument`. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract information about people and instruments:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}
```
