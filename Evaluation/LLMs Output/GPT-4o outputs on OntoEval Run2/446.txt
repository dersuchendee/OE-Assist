**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific band lineup with a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for bands, musicians, and lineups, but it lacks a mechanism to specify the time period during which a particular lineup was active. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?lineup ?musician
WHERE {
  ?band a :Band .
  ?lineup a :LineUp .
  ?lineup :partOfBand ?band .
  ?lineup :hasMember ?musician .
}
```
