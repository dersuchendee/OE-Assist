**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to the concept of a "band" or "members of a band" at a specific point in time. The ontology primarily focuses on music albums, tracks, and related concepts, but lacks the necessary structure to represent band membership over time.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on albums and tracks:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
```
