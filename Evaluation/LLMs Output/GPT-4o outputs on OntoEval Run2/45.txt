**No**

The ontology does not explicitly define a relationship between actors and competencies. However, we can extract partial information about actors and their capabilities, which might be related to competencies.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?capability
WHERE {
  ?capability a :Capability .
  ?capability :capabilityOf ?actor .
}
```
