**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the members of a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to band membership and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements that would allow for querying the members of a band at a specific time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?membershipPeriod
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOfBand ?bandMembership .
  ?bandMembership :bandMember ?band .
  ?bandMembership :membershipPeriod ?membershipPeriod .
}
```

This query retrieves the persons, bands, and membership periods, but it does not filter by a specific point in time.
