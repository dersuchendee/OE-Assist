**Yes**

The competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for band members and their membership periods.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?member ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?bandMembership a :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?bandMembership :hasMember ?band .
  ?bandMembership :memberOfBand ?member .
  ?bandMembership :duringTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
```

This query retrieves the band, its members, and the time period during which the membership is valid, which aligns with the competency question.
