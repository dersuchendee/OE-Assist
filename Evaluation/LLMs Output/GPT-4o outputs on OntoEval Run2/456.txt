**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate band members with specific points in time. The ontology includes information about band membership, but it lacks temporal data to specify when each person was a member of the band. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band
WHERE {
  ?person :memberOf ?band .
}
```

This query retrieves the members of bands, but it does not include temporal information about when they were members.
