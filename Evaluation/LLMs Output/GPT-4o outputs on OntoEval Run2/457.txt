**Yes**

The competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for band members and their membership times. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?member ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  ?bandMembership a :Cl_BandMembership ;
                  :hasMember ?member ;
                  :memberOf ?band ;
                  :membershipTime ?membershipTime .
}
ORDER BY ?band ?membershipTime
```

This query retrieves the band, its members, and the time of their membership, allowing us to determine the members of a band at a specific point in time.
