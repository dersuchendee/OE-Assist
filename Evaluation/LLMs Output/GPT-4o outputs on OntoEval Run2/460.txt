**Yes**

The competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for band memberships and their associated time periods.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership .
  ?membership :membershipBand ?band .
  ?membership :membershipPerson ?person .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate . }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?membership :hasRole ?roleObj .
    ?roleObj :roleName ?role .
  }
  FILTER (?startDate <= "2023-10-01"^^xsd:date && (!bound(?endDate) || ?endDate >= "2023-10-01"^^xsd:date))
}
ORDER BY ?startDate
```

This query retrieves the members of a band, their roles, and the time period of their membership, filtered to include only those memberships that are active on a specific date (in this case, October 1, 2023).
