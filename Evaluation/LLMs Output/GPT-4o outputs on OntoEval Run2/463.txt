**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about band members or their membership at specific points in time. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying bands and their members, but without the temporal aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?member
WHERE {
  ?band a :Cl_Band .
  ?band :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership :isMember ?member .
}
```
