**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a band with its members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for bands, people, and memberships, but it lacks a mechanism to query the members of a band at a specific time. The membership class has start and end dates, but there is no direct way to filter memberships based on a specific date in a SPARQL query.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?person ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipInBand ?band .
  ?membership :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd . }
}
```

This query retrieves the bands, their members, and the start and end dates of their memberships, but it does not filter by a specific point in time.
