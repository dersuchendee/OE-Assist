The competency question "What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to connect a person, a band, and a role at a specific time through the `Cl_BandMembership` class. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?time
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?membership :membershipOfPerson ?person .
  ?membership :membershipInBand ?band .
  ?membership :playsRole ?role .
  ?membership :atTime ?time .
}
```
