**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between actors and the competencies they hold for specific work. The ontology defines the relationships between actors, competencies, and work, but it does not explicitly link actors to the competencies required for the work they perform. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract actors and their competencies:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?competency
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Actor .
  ?actor :hasCompetency ?competency .
}
```
