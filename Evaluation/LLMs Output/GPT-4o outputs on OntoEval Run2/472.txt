**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for `Person`, `Band`, `Role`, and `TimeInterval`, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements to answer the competency question. The ontology would need a reification or a specific class to represent the association of a person, role, band, and time interval together.

However, we can extract partial information about the roles of persons in bands without the time aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?band ?bandName ?role ?roleName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person ;
          :personName ?personName ;
          :isMemberOf ?band ;
          :hasRole ?role .
  ?band a :Band ;
        :bandName ?bandName .
  ?role a :Role ;
        :roleName ?roleName .
}
```
