**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for people, bands, roles, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements to answer the competency question fully. However, we can extract partial information about band memberships and roles without the specific time context.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOfBand ?bandMembership .
  ?bandMembership :bandMember ?band .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?person :hasRoleInBand ?bandRole .
    ?bandRole :roleInBand ?role .
  }
}
```
