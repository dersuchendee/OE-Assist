**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for people, bands, roles, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements to answer the competency question. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role
WHERE {
  ?bandRole a :Cl_BandRole .
  ?bandRole :hasRole ?person .
  ?bandRole :roleOf ?band .
  ?bandRole :rolePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
```
