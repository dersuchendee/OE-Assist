**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for people, roles, bands, and membership, but it lacks a direct connection between a person's role and the time period during which they held that role in a band. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?band
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleInBand ?band .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, their role, and the band they are associated with, but it does not include the time aspect.
