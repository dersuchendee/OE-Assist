**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for people, bands, roles, and memberships, but it lacks a temporal component to capture the role of a person in a band at a specific time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?band .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?bandMembership a :Cl_BandMembership .
    ?bandMembership :hasRole ?role .
    ?bandMembership :bandMembership ?person .
  }
}
```

This query retrieves the person, band, and role information, but it does not include the temporal aspect required by the competency question.
