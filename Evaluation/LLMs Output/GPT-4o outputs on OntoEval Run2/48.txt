**No**

The ontology does not directly model the concept of actors involved in a circular value network (CVN) in a way that allows for a straightforward SPARQL query to extract them. The ontology defines various classes and properties related to actors, roles, and participations, but it does not explicitly connect these to a CVN in a manner that can be queried directly.

However, we can attempt to extract partial information about actors and their roles, but this will not directly answer the competency question as it is stated.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role
WHERE {
  ?participation a actor:CVNParticipation .
  ?participation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  ?participation actorODP:participantRole ?role .
}
```

This query attempts to find actors and their roles in the context of a CVN participation, but it does not directly answer the question of which actors are involved in a specific CVN.
