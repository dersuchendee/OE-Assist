**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the specific roles a person has in a band at a certain point in time. While it includes classes and properties related to band membership and roles, it lacks the temporal aspect required to answer the competency question fully. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?band
WHERE {
  ?bandRole a :Cl_BandRole ;
            :roleOf ?person ;
            :hasRole ?role ;
            :roleInBand ?band .
}
```
