**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for people, bands, and memberships, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and the time period of their membership in a band. The ontology does not have a property that directly links a person to a role within a band at a specific time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipIn ?band .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipStart ?membershipStart . }
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd . }
}
```

This query retrieves the person, the band they are a member of, and the start and end dates of their membership, but it does not include the specific role they have in the band.
