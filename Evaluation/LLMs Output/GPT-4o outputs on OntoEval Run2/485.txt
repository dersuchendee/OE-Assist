**Yes**

The competency question "What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query the role of a person in a band during a specific membership period. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?start ?end
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipIn ?band .
  ?membership :hasRole ?role .
  ?membership :membershipStart ?start .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?end . }
}
```

This query retrieves the person, band, role, and membership period (start and optional end date) for each membership instance, which directly answers the competency question.
