**No**

The ontology provided does not include any classes or properties related to roles, bands, or time points that would allow us to answer the competency question about the role of a person in a band at a certain point in time. The ontology primarily focuses on albums and tracks, without any mention of people, roles, or bands.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on albums and tracks:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
```
