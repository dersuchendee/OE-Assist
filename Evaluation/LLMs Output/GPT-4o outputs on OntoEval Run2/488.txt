**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes that directly relate to a person's role in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to band membership, roles, and time periods, but there is no direct connection between a person, their role, and a specific time period within the ontology. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?band a :Cl_Band .
  ?role a :Cl_Role .
  ?timePeriod a :Cl_TimePeriod .

  ?person :isMemberOfBand ?bandMembership .
  ?band :hasMember ?bandMembership .
  ?bandMembership :memberOfDuring ?timePeriod .

  ?person :hasRoleInBand ?bandRole .
  ?bandRole :playsRole ?role .
  ?bandRole :roleDuring ?timePeriod .
}
```

This query attempts to gather information about a person's membership in a band, their role, and the time period of their membership, but it does not directly answer the competency question as it lacks a direct link between a specific person, their role, and a specific point in time.
