**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between the album and its recording period. The class `Cl_AlbumRecording` is not directly linked to `Cl_Album`, and the properties `dp_recordingStartDate` and `dp_recordingEndDate` are associated with `Cl_AlbumRecording`, not `Cl_Album`. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?album ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?albumRecording a :Cl_AlbumRecording .
  ?albumRecording :dp_recordingStartDate ?startDate .
  ?albumRecording :dp_recordingEndDate ?endDate .
}
```
