The competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about albums, recording sessions, and time intervals, which allows us to extract the recording period for a specific album.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the recording period for an album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?album a ns1:Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  ?album ns1:hasRecordingSession ?recordingSession .
  ?recordingSession ns1:hasTimeInterval ?timeInterval .
  ?timeInterval ns1:hasStartDate ?startDate .
  ?timeInterval ns1:hasEndDate ?endDate .
}
```
