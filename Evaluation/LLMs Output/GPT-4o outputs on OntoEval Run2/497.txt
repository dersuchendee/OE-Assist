**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate an album with a specific time period during which it was recorded. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums, tracks, and recording periods, but it lacks a direct connection between an album and its recording period. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying albums and their associated recording periods, but it may not provide the specific time period for a particular album.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?recordingPeriod
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :recordedAlbum ?albumRecording .
  ?albumRecording :recordingPeriod ?recordingPeriod .
}
```
