The competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums and their recording periods, specifically the `:recordedDuring`, `:recordingStart`, and `:recordingEnd` properties.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the recording period for a specific album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :recordedDuring ?recording .
  ?recording :recordingStart ?recordingStart .
  ?recording :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
}
```

This query retrieves the start and end dates of the recording period for each album in the ontology.
