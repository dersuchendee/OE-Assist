The competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums and recording sessions, specifically the `:recordedDuring` object property and the `:recordingStartDate` and `:recordingEndDate` data properties. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?recordingStartDate ?recordingEndDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :recordedDuring ?recordingSession .
  ?recordingSession :recordingStartDate ?recordingStartDate .
  ?recordingSession :recordingEndDate ?recordingEndDate .
}
