The competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate to albums and their recording periods, specifically the `Cl_RecordingPeriod` class with properties `recordingStart` and `recordingEnd`.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the recording period for a specific album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?recordingPeriod a :Cl_RecordingPeriod ;
                   :recordedAlbum ?album ;
                   :recordingStart ?recordingStart ;
                   :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
}
```

This query retrieves the album along with its recording start and end dates, which directly answers the competency question.
