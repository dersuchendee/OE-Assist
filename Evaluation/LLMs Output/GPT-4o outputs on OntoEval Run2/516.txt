**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to count the number of tracks in an album. However, we can extract partial information about the tracks that are part of an album.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album .
  ?track a :MusicTrack .
  ?track :partOfAlbum ?album .
}
```
