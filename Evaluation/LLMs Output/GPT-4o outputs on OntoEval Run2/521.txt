**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct properties or classes that relate to the concept of an "album" or the number of tracks it contains. The ontology is focused on people, bands, instruments, roles, and performances, but it lacks the necessary structure to represent albums and their tracks.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for any existing tracks, but it will not provide the number of tracks in an album as the ontology does not support this concept.

```sparql
SELECT ?track
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
}
```

This query will return any instances of tracks, but without the context of an album or the number of tracks it contains.
