**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct properties or classes that relate to the concept of an "album" containing "tracks" or the number of tracks in an album. The ontology primarily focuses on band membership, roles, performances, and locations, but it lacks the necessary structure to directly answer the competency question regarding the number of tracks in an album.

However, we can attempt to extract a partial answer by querying for any information related to albums and tracks, even though it may not directly answer the question about the number of tracks in a particular album.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTracks ?track .
}
```

This query attempts to find any relationships between albums and tracks, but without a specific property for the number of tracks, it cannot fully answer the competency question.
