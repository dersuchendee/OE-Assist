The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:numberOfTracks` data property associated with the `:Cl_Album` class, which allows us to retrieve the number of tracks for a specific album.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?numberOfTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :numberOfTracks ?numberOfTracks .
}
```
