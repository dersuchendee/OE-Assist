The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:albumContainsTrack` property, which links an album to its tracks. We can count the number of tracks associated with a specific album using a SPARQL query.

```sparql
SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :albumContainsTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album
```
