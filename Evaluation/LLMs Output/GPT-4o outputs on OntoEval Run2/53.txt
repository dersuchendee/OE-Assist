**No**

The ontology does not directly provide a way to extract actors involved in a value network without additional information or properties that directly link actors to the value network. However, we can extract a partial answer by identifying actors that are involved in any process within a value network.

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?actor
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :op_performsProcess ?process .
  ?valueNetwork :op_hasProcess ?process .
}
```
