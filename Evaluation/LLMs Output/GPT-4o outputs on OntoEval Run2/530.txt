The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Album` and the datatype property `numberOfTracks`, which allows us to query the number of tracks for a specific album.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the number of tracks for a particular album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?numberOfTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :numberOfTracks ?numberOfTracks .
}
```
