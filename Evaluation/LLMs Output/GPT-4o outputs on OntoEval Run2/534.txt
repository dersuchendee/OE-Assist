**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about albums or tracks. The ontology primarily focuses on band membership, roles, instruments, and performances. There is no class or property that directly relates to albums or tracks, which makes it impossible to answer the competency question about the number of tracks in a particular album.

However, a partial query could be constructed to extract information about any existing albums, but it will not provide the number of tracks:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
}
```

This query will return any instances of the class `Cl_Album`, but without additional properties or data, it cannot provide the number of tracks for each album.
