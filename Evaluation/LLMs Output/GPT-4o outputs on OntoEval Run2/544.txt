**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the release date of an album. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums, tracks, and recordings, but it lacks a direct property or class that associates an album with its release date. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for albums, but the release date information is not available.

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
}
```
