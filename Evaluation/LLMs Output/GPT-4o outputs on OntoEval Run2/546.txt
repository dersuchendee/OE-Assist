**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about albums or their release dates. Therefore, the competency question "When was a certain album released?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about albums if they were present.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate . }
}
```
