The competency question "When was a certain album released?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Album` with a data property `releaseDate` that specifies the release date of an album. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the release date of a specific album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the release date for each album in the ontology. You can specify a particular album by adding a filter or directly querying for a specific album URI if needed.
