**No**

The ontology does not directly support the competency question as it lacks a direct connection between a product and the materials it consists of. The ontology uses a reification approach with the `Cl_ProductComposition` class, but the competency question asks for a direct relationship between products and materials. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer using the existing ontology structure:

```sparql
SELECT ?product ?material
WHERE {
  ?product a :Cl_Product .
  ?product :consistsOf ?composition .
  ?composition :hasMaterial ?material .
}
```
