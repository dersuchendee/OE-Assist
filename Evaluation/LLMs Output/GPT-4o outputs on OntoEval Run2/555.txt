**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about the release date of an album. Therefore, the competency question "When was a certain album released?" cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, we can extract partial information about albums and their tracks.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
```
