**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct relationship between a specific track and the song it is a recording of. The ontology defines a `Track` class and a `MusicalWork` class, but there is no property that links a `Track` to a `MusicalWork` to indicate that a track is a recording of a specific song. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?track ?trackLabel
WHERE {
  ?track a :Track .
  OPTIONAL { ?track rdfs:label ?trackLabel . }
}
```
