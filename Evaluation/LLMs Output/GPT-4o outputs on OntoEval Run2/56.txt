The competency question "What materials does a product consist of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a `consistsOf` object property that relates a `Product` to the `Material` it consists of. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?product ?productLabel ?material ?materialLabel
WHERE {
  ?product a :Product .
  OPTIONAL { ?product rdfs:label ?productLabel . }

  ?product :consistsOf ?material .
  OPTIONAL { ?material rdfs:label ?materialLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?product
```
