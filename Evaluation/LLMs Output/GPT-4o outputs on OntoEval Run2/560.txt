**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link a specific track to the song it is a recording of. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums, tracks, and musicians, but it lacks a specific property or class that directly connects a track to the song it is a recording of. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?trackName ?album ?albumName
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_MusicTrack .
  ?track :hasTitle ?trackName .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
  ?album :hasTitle ?albumName .
}
```
