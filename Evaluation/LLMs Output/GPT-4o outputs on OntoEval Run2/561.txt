**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a track and the song it is a recording of. The ontology defines `ns1:Track` and `ns1:Song` as separate classes, and while `ns1:HumpDeBump` is both a `ns1:Song` and a `ns1:Track`, there is no explicit property linking a track to a song it records. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?track ?trackLabel
WHERE {
  ?track a ns1:Track .
  OPTIONAL { ?track rdfs:label ?trackLabel . }
}
```
