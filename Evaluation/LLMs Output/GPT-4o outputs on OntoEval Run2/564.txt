The competency question "What song is a specific track a recording of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate tracks to songs, specifically through the `:isRecordingOf` property which links a `:Track` to a `:Song`. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?trackTitle ?song ?songTitle
WHERE {
  ?track a :Track ;
         :trackTitle ?trackTitle ;
         :isRecordingOf ?song .
  ?song a :Song ;
        :songTitle ?songTitle .
}
```
