**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link a specific track to the song it is a recording of. The ontology includes classes and properties related to songs, tracks, and albums, but it lacks a direct property or relationship that specifies which song a track is a recording of. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying tracks and their associated albums, but not the specific song each track is a recording of.

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?trackName ?album ?albumName
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  OPTIONAL { ?track :trackName ?trackName . }
  ?track :isTrackOf ?album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album :albumName ?albumName . }
}
```
