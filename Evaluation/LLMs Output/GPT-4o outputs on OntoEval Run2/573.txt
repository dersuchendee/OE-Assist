The competency question "What song is a specific track a recording of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:recordingOf` property, which links a `:Cl_Track` to a `:Cl_Song`. This allows us to query for the song that a specific track is a recording of.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :recordingOf ?song .
}
```
