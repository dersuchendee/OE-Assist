**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about songs or their relationship to tracks. Therefore, the competency question "What song is a specific track a recording of?" cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, we can extract partial information about tracks and albums.

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
```
