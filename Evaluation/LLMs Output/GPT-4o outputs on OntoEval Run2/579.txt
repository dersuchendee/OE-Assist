The competency question "What song is a specific track a recording of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the classes `Cl_Track` and `Cl_Song`, and the object property `:isRecordingOf` which connects a track to the song it is a recording of. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?song .
}
```
