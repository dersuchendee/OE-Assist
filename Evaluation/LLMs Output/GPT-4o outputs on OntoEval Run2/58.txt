**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the composition of a material. The ontology defines classes and properties related to products, components, materials, properties, and provenance, but it does not explicitly define a way to query the composition of a material. The closest we can get is to query the materials that make up a component, but this does not directly answer the CQ about the composition of a material.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists the materials that make up components:

```sparql
SELECT ?component ?material
WHERE {
  ?component a :Component .
  ?component :isMadeOf ?material .
}
```
