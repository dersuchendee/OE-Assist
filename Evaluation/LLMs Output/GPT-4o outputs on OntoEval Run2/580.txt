**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to connect a specific track to the song it is a recording of. The ontology includes classes and properties related to tracks and songs, but the specific relationship between a track and the song it is a recording of is not explicitly defined. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying tracks and their associated recordings, but not the specific song they are a recording of.

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?recording
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?recording .
}
```
