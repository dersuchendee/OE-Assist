The competency question "When was a certain song composed?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `ns1:composedOn` property, which indicates the date on which a track was composed. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the composition date of a specific song:

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?songLabel ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a ns1:Song ;
        rdfs:label ?songLabel ;
        ns1:composedOn ?compositionDate .
}
```
