The competency question "When was a certain song composed?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:compositionDate` property for the `:Song` class, which allows us to query the composition date of a song.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the composition date of a specific song:

```sparql
SELECT ?songTitle ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Song ;
        :songTitle ?songTitle ;
        :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
```
