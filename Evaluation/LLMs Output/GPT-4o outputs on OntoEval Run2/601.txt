The ontology provided does not contain any information about the composition date of songs. Therefore, the competency question "When was a certain song composed?" cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying songs within the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?song
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
}
