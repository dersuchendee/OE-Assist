**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about critics or their reviews of records. Therefore, the competency question "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, we can extract partial information about albums and their reviews, but not specifically what a critic says about a record.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract partial information about albums and their reviews:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?review ?statement
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :reviewedBy ?review .
  ?review :statement ?statement .
}
```

This query retrieves albums and their associated review statements, but it does not specify which critic made the statement, as that information is not present in the ontology.
