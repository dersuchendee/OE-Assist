**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link a critic to a specific record and their critique about it. The ontology includes classes and properties related to critics, critiques, and records, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific critic and their opinion on a specific record. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?critic ?critiqueText ?record
WHERE {
  ?critic a :Cl_Critic .
  ?critic :criticizes ?critique .
  ?critique :critiqueText ?critiqueText .
  ?critique :critiqueOf ?record .
}
```
