**No**

The ontology provided does not include any classes or properties related to critics, reviews, or records. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SPARQL query to extract the answer to the competency question "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" based on the given ontology.

However, a partial answer could be extracted if the ontology had some relevant information. Here's a SPARQL query that would attempt to extract such information if it existed:

```sparql
SELECT ?critic ?reviewContent
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_Review .
  ?review :writtenBy ?critic .
  ?review :reviewContent ?reviewContent .
}
```

This query assumes the existence of classes and properties related to reviews and critics, which are not present in the provided ontology.
