**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes related to critics or critiques of records. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about records and critics, but not their critiques.

```sparql
SELECT ?record ?critic
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Record .
  ?critic a :Cl_Critic .
}
```
