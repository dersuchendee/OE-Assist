**Yes**

The competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Performance` and the datatype property `hasPerformanceDate`, which allows us to query for the date and time of a performance.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  ?performance :hasPerformanceDate ?date .
}
```
