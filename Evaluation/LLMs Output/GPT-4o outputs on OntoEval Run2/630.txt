The competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about performances and their dates, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the performance date.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a ns1:Performance .
  ?performance ns1:hasPerformanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```
