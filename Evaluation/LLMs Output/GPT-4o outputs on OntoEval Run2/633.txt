**No**

The ontology does not provide explicit information about the dates of performances. However, we can extract partial information about performances and their associated time intervals.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  ?performance :hasTimeInterval ?timeInterval .
  ?timeInterval :startDate ?startDate .
  ?timeInterval :endDate ?endDate .
}
```
