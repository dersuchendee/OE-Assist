**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific performance took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances, such as `Cl_Performance` and `performanceDate`, but it does not specify how to associate a particular performance with a specific date or event. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for performances and their dates, but it will not specify which performance took place on a certain date.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?date .
}
```
