**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about performances or their dates. Therefore, we cannot directly answer the competency question about when a certain performance took place. However, we can extract partial information about performances that are related to the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate . }
}
```
