**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about performances or their dates. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the performances, if any, without their dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
}
```
