**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about performances or their dates. Therefore, we cannot directly answer the competency question about when a certain performance took place. However, we can extract partial information about performances if they were present in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
}
```
