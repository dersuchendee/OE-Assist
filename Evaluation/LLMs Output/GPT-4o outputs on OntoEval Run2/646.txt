**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific performance took place. The ontology includes a `:performanceDate` property for the `:Cl_Performance` class, but there is no direct connection between a specific performance and its date in the provided ontology. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by listing performances and their dates, but it cannot specify a certain performance without additional information.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```
