**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to performances or dates of performances. Therefore, the competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for any performance-related classes or properties that might exist, but in this case, there are none.

Partial SPARQL query for any performance-related data (if it existed):

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?date .
}
```

Since the ontology does not define any performance-related classes or properties, this query will not return any results.
