The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate songs with specific performances. The ontology includes classes and properties for musical groups, albums, tracks, and performances, but it lacks a direct connection between performances and the specific songs played during those performances. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists performances and their associated musical groups:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?musicGroup
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?performance :hasPerformanceDate ?performanceDate .
  ?performance :performedBy ?musicGroup .
}
```
