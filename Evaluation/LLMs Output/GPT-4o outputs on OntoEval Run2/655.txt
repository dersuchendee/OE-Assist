**No**

The ontology provided does not contain a direct connection between performances and the songs played during those performances. The ontology includes classes and properties related to songs, tracks, and performances, but it lacks a direct link between a specific performance and the songs played during that performance. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the tracks associated with albums, but this does not specify which songs were played in a particular performance.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?track
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
```
