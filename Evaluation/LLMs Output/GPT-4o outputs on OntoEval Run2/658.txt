The competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate performances to songs, allowing us to query for songs performed in a specific performance.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?song
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedSong ?performanceSong .
  ?performanceSong :songPerformed ?song .
}
```

This query retrieves the songs played in each performance by leveraging the `:performedSong` and `:songPerformed` properties.
