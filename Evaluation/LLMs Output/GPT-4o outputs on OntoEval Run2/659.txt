**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to performances or songs played during performances. Therefore, the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying tracks and songs, but not their association with specific performances.

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :recordingOf ?recording .
  ?recording :songRecorded ?song .
}
```
