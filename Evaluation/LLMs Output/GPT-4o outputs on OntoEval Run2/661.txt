**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about performances or setlists that would allow us to determine which songs were played in a specific performance. However, we can extract partial information about songs and albums.

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?album
WHERE {
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?song .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```
