**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about specific performances or the songs played during those performances. The ontology includes classes and properties related to bands, albums, tracks, and songs, but it does not have any data or relationships that specify which songs were played in a particular performance.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list performances and their dates, but it won't provide the songs played:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```
