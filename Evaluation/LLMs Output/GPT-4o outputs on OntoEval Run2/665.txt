**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about performances or songs played in performances. Therefore, the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to performances and songs, if any, from the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?song
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?performanceSong a :Cl_PerformanceSong ;
                     :performedIn ?performance ;
                     :performedSong ?song .
  }
}
```
