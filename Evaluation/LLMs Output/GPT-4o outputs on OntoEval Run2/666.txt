The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate songs with specific performances. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances and songs, but it lacks a direct connection between a performance and the songs played during that performance. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists performances and their dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```
