The competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to identify performances and the songs performed during those performances. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?song
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedDuring ?performanceDate .
  ?performance :includesSong ?performedSong .
  ?performedSong :songPerformed ?song .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate
```

This query retrieves the performances, their dates, and the songs performed during each performance.
