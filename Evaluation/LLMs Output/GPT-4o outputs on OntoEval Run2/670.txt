**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about performances or songs played during performances. Therefore, the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about tracks in albums, but not specifically about performances.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information about tracks in albums:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
```
