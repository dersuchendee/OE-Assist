**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to performances or songs played during performances. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to tracks and songs, but it will not be specific to performances.

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?trackRecording .
  ?trackRecording :recordedSong ?song .
}
```
