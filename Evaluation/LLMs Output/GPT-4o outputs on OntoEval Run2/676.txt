The competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about performances and their locations, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the location of a specific performance.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a ns1:Performance .
  ?performance ns1:performedAt ?location .
}
```
