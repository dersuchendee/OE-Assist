The competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances, locations, and the relationship between them. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the location of a specific performance:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  ?performance :hasLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves the performance and its associated location, along with the label of the location if available.
