The competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances and their locations, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the location of a given performance.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?location :isLocationOfPerformance ?performance .
}
```
