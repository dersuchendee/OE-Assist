**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a performance. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances, bands, and locations, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific performance and its location. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?performance :performedAt ?location .
  }
}
```
