**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the specific location where a performance took place. It includes classes and properties related to performances, venues, and cities, but it does not explicitly connect a performance to a specific venue or city in a way that answers the competency question directly.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?venue ?city
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :takesPlaceIn ?venue . }
  OPTIONAL { ?venue :locatedIn ?city . }
}
```
