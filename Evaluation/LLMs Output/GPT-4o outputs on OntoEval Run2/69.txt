The competency question "What is the composition of a specific resource?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Resource` and an object property `op_hasComposition` that links a resource to its composition, which is represented by the class `Cl_ResourceComposition`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the composition of a specific resource.

```sparql
SELECT ?resource ?composition
WHERE {
  ?resource a :Cl_Resource .
  ?resource :op_hasComposition ?composition .
}
```
