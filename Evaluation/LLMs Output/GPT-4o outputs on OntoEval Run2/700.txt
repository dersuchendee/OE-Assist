**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the region in which a city is located. It only provides information about cities, regions, and countries, but lacks the necessary relationships to determine the specific region a city is part of.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :City .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?city :isPartOf ?region .
    ?region a :Region .
  }
}
```
