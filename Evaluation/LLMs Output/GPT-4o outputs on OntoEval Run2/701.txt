**No**

The competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" is not fully supported by the given ontology. The ontology provides classes and properties related to locations, cities, and regions, but it does not provide a direct way to query the region of a specific city. The ontology includes the `:isLocatedIn` property, which relates cities to regions, but without specific instances or data, we cannot extract a complete answer.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, assuming instances of cities and regions were available:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?region .
}
```
