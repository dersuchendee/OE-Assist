The competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate cities to regions, specifically through the `:cityRegion` and `:regionOfCity` properties. Here is a SPARQL query that can be used to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityRegion ?cityRegion .
  ?cityRegion :regionOfCity ?region .
}
```
