**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and its region. The `locatedIn` property connects a city to a region, but there is no direct connection from a city to a country. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the region a city is located in.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?region .
}
```
