The competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" is not fully supported by the ontology. The ontology provides information about cities and their locations within regions, but it does not provide a direct way to query for the region of a specific city without knowing the city in advance. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?region .
}
```
