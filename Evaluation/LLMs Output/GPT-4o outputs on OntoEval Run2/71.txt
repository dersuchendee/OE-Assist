**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a component or product with its materials. The ontology defines a class for products, materials, and material compositions, but there is no direct link between a product and its materials. The `op_hasMaterialComposition` property links a product to a material composition, and `op_composedOf` links a material composition to materials, but without instances or further details, we cannot directly answer the CQ.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?product ?material
WHERE {
  ?product a :Cl_Product .
  ?product :op_hasMaterialComposition ?composition .
  ?composition :op_composedOf ?material .
}
```
