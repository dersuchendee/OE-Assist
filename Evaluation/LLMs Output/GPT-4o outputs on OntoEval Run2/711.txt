**No**

The competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" is not fully supported by the ontology. The ontology provides information about cities and regions, but it does not explicitly link cities to regions through a property that can be queried directly. However, we can extract partial information about cities and their potential regions.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityName ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :locationName ?cityName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?city :locatedIn ?region . }
}
```
