**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the region in which a city is located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to cities, regions, and their relationships, but it does not explicitly model the concept of a city being located in a specific region. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?city :isLocatedIn ?region .
  }
}
```
