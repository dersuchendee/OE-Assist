**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the region in which a city is located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to cities and regions, but it lacks a direct connection or property that specifies the region for a given city. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by listing cities, but without their corresponding regions.

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
}
```
