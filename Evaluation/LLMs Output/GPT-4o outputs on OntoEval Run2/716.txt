**No**

The competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" is not fully supported by the ontology provided. The ontology defines classes and properties related to geographical entities, cities, and regions, but it does not provide a direct way to query the region of a specific city. However, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the cities and their associated regions.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isInRegion ?region .
}
```
