The competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for regions and countries, and an object property `op_isLocatedIn` that relates a region to a country. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?regionLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionLabel . }
  
  ?region :op_isLocatedIn ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
}
```
