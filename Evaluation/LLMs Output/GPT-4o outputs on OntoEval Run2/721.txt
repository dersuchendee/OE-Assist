**No**

The competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" is not fully supported by the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to music groups, albums, tracks, musicians, and performances, but it does not include any information about geographic locations or regions. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only provide a partial answer based on the available data.

```sparql
SELECT ?region
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
}
```

This query will return any instances of the class `Cl_Region`, but it will not provide information about the country in which the region is located, as that information is not present in the ontology.
