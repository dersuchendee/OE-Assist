**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the country in which a specific region is located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to cities, regions, and countries, but it lacks a direct connection or property that specifies the country for a given region. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?region :partOf ?country .
    ?country a :Cl_Country .
  }
}
```
