**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the country in which a region is located. However, we can extract partial information about the regions and their hierarchical relationships.

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?region :isPartOf ?country .
    ?country a :Cl_Country .
  }
}
```
