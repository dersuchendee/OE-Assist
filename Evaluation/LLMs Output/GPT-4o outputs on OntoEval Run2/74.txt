**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the specific dates when a theatre festival took place. The ontology includes a `hasDate` property for `TheatreFestival`, but it is not used in the provided individuals to specify the exact dates of the festivals. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasName ?festivalName .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :hasDate ?date . }
}
```
