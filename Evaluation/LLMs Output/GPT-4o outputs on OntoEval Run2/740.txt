**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the country in which a region is located. The ontology includes classes and properties for cities, regions, and countries, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific region and its corresponding country. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying regions, but not their associated countries.

```sparql
SELECT ?region
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
}
```
