**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Album` class that specifies it must have at least one `Track`. This is represented by the `owl:minCardinality "1"` restriction on the `hasTrack` property for the `Album` class.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that every album in the ontology contains at least one track:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
```

This query will return all albums and their associated tracks, confirming that each album has at least one track.
