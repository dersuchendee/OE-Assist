**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to music, albums, tracks, or records. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SPARQL query to answer the competency question "A record always contains at least one track" using the given ontology. However, a partial query could be written to extract information about any existing classes or properties, but it would not be relevant to the competency question.

```sparql
SELECT ?subject ?predicate ?object
WHERE {
  ?subject ?predicate ?object .
}
LIMIT 10
```

This query will return a partial answer by listing some of the existing triples in the ontology, but it will not address the competency question regarding records and tracks.
