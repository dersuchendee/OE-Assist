**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to music, albums, tracks, or recordings. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question "A record always contains at least one track" using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract a partial answer by querying for any related concepts that might exist in the ontology, but it is unlikely to yield relevant results for the CQ.

```sparql
SELECT ?record ?track
WHERE {
  ?record a ns1:Publication .
  OPTIONAL { ?record ns1:hasArticle ?track . }
}
```

This query attempts to find any publications that might have articles, but it does not directly relate to music records or tracks.
