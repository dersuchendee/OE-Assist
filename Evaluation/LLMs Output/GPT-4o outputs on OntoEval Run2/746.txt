**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to music, albums, tracks, or recordings. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question regarding whether a record always contains at least one track. However, we can attempt to extract a partial answer by querying for any existing classes or properties that might be related to collections or items within collections, which could be analogous to records and tracks.

```sparql
SELECT ?collection ?item
WHERE {
  ?collection a :ArticleCollection .
  ?collection :contains ?item .
}
```

This query attempts to find any collections and their contained items, which could be conceptually similar to records and tracks, but it does not directly answer the competency question.
