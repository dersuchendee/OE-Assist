**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology defines an `Album` class with a restriction that it must have at least one `Track`. This aligns with the competency question, which states that a record (album) always contains at least one track.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that every album has at least one track:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumTitle
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album .
  ?album :albumTitle ?albumTitle .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
```
