The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Record` and the property `:containsTrack` which links a record to a track. This implies that a record can contain tracks, and we can query for records that contain at least one track.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract records that contain at least one track:

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?record
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Record .
  ?record :containsTrack ?track .
}
```

This query retrieves all records that have at least one associated track, satisfying the competency question.
