**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Record` and the property `containsTrack` which links a record to a track. This implies that a record can contain one or more tracks. We can write a SPARQL query to verify that every record has at least one track associated with it.

```sparql
SELECT ?record
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Record .
  ?record :containsTrack ?track .
}
```

This query retrieves all records that have at least one track, thus confirming that the ontology supports the competency question.
