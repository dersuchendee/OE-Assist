**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology defines a class `Cl_Record` with a restriction that it must have at least one `Cl_Track` through the `containsTrack` property. This aligns with the competency question.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that every record contains at least one track:

```sparql
SELECT ?record ?track
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Record .
  ?record :containsTrack ?track .
}
```
