**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Cl_Album` class that specifies it must have at least one `Cl_Track` through the `containsTrack` property. This aligns with the competency question, which states that a record (album) always contains at least one track.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify this:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```
