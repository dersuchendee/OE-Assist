**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Cl_Album` class that ensures it always contains at least one `Cl_Track`. This is represented by the OWL restriction:

```turtle
:Cl_Album rdf:type owl:Class ;
          rdfs:subClassOf [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
                            owl:onProperty :containsTrack ;
                            owl:someValuesFrom :Cl_Track ] .
```

This restriction ensures that every instance of `Cl_Album` must have at least one `Cl_Track` associated with it via the `containsTrack` property. Therefore, the competency question is answerable by the ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that every album contains at least one track:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```

This query retrieves all albums that contain at least one track, confirming the competency question's requirement.
