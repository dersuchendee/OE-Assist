**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_Record` and the object property `:hasTrack`, which connects a record to a track. This implies that a record can have one or more tracks. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to check if every record has at least one track.

```sparql
SELECT ?record
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Record .
  ?record :hasTrack ?track .
}
```

This query will return all records that have at least one track, thus verifying the competency question.
