The ontology provided does not have a direct way to query for medical degrees associated with a person. The ontology includes classes and properties related to medical and nursing degrees, but it lacks instances or specific data that would allow us to query for a person's medical degrees. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list persons and their associated nursing degrees, if any:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?nursingDegree
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?person :hasNursingDegree ?nursingDegree .
  }
}
```
