**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with their medical degrees. The ontology includes classes for `Cl_Person` and `Cl_MedicalDegree`, but there is no direct object property linking a person to their medical degrees. The ontology does not have a reified class or a direct property that connects a person to their medical degrees, which is necessary to answer the competency question.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?degree a :Cl_MedicalDegree .
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of `Cl_Person` and `Cl_MedicalDegree`, but it does not establish a relationship between them, as the ontology lacks the necessary properties to do so.
