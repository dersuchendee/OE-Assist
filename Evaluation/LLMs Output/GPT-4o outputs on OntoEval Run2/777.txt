The competency question "What medical degrees does a certain person have?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to retrieve the medical degrees associated with a person. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeTitle ?degreeObtainedDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree a :Cl_MedicalDegree .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle . }
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeObtainedDate ?degreeObtainedDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves the person, their medical degrees, the title of each degree, and the date each degree was obtained, if available.
