**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the medical degrees of a specific person. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Person` and a property `hasMedicalDegree` that connects a person to a medical degree, but it lacks the necessary instances or data to directly answer the competency question. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
}
```
