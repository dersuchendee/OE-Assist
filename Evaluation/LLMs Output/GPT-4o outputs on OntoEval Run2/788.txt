The competency question is supported by the ontology, as it is possible to write a SPARQL query to extract the answer. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to determine the study period for a specific person and the degree they studied for.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :op_studiedDuring ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :op_forDegree ?degree .
  ?studyPeriod :dp_studyStartDate ?startDate .
  ?studyPeriod :dp_studyEndDate ?endDate .
}
```
