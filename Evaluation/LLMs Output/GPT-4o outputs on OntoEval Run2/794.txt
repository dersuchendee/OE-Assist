**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the time period during which a person studied for a specific degree. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, degrees, and study events, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the time interval of their study for a specific degree.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeName ?degreeDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :hasDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeName ?degreeName .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeDate ?degreeDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves the person, the degree they have, the name of the degree, and optionally the date the degree was obtained, but it does not provide the time period during which the person studied for the degree.
