**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link a person to the specific time period they studied for a specific degree. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, degrees, and studying, but it lacks a direct connection or reification that captures the time period of study for a specific degree. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :studiedFor ?studyingForDegree .
  ?studyingForDegree :hasDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeName ?degreeName .
}
```
