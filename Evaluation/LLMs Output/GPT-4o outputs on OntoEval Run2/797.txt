**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link a person to a specific degree and the time period during which they studied for it. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, degrees, and study periods, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, a specific degree, and the associated study period.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :studiedFor ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :degree ?degree .
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate . }
}
```
