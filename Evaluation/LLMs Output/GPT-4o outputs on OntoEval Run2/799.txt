**No**

The ontology does not provide explicit information about the study period for each degree. The `Cl_StudyPeriod` class is defined, but the `studyStartDate` for the `CertifiedNurseStudyPeriod` is marked as "UNKNOWN". Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question regarding the time period a person studied for a specific degree.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeTitle ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?degree :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
    ?studyPeriod :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate .
    ?studyPeriod :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
  }
}
```
