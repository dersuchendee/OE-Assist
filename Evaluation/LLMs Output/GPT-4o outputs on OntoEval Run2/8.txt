**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the context of usage of a source. The ontology includes classes and properties related to sources, their contexts, creators, events, and historical periods, but it does not explicitly define a property or class that represents the "context of usage" of a source. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only extract partial information related to the context of a source, such as its creator, production date, and location.

```sparql
SELECT ?source ?context ?creator ?productionDate ?productionLocation
WHERE {
  ?source a :Cl_Source .
  ?source :Op_hasSourceContext ?context .
  OPTIONAL { ?context :Op_createdBy ?creator . }
  OPTIONAL { ?context :Dp_hasProductionDate ?productionDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?context :Dp_hasProductionLocation ?productionLocation . }
}
```
