**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific theatre festival took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, productions, and plays, but it lacks a direct connection between a festival and its specific date or time period. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the available information about theatre festivals:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :festivalName ?festivalName . }
}
```

This query retrieves the names of theatre festivals, but it does not provide the specific dates when they took place, as that information is not present in the ontology.
