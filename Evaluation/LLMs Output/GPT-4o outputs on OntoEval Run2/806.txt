**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific person with a specific degree and the time period during which they studied for that degree. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, medical degrees, and study periods, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, a specific degree, and the corresponding study period.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyStart ?studyEnd
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?person :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
    ?studyPeriod :studyStart ?studyStart .
    ?studyPeriod :studyEnd ?studyEnd .
  }
}
```

This query retrieves persons, their degrees, and any available study periods, but it does not directly link a person to a specific degree and the corresponding study period.
