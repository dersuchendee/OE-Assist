The competency question "During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate a person to a degree and the study period, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the study start and end dates for a person and a specific degree.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?studyPeriod a :Cl_PersonDegreeStudyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :hasPerson ?person .
  ?studyPeriod :hasDegree ?degree .
  ?studyPeriod :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate .
  ?studyPeriod :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
}
```
