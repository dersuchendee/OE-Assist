**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with the specific date they were first employed at a hospital. The ontology includes an `employmentStartDate` property, but it is associated with the `Employment` class, not directly with a `Person` or `Hospital`. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a ns1:Person .
  ?person ns1:hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment ns1:employedAt ?hospital .
  ?employment ns1:employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
}
```
