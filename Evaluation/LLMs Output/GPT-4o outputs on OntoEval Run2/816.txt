**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a certain person was first employed at a certain hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment events, but it does not explicitly connect a person to their employment start date at a specific hospital. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?employmentEvent a :Cl_EmploymentEvent .
  ?employmentEvent :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  ?employee :hasEmploymentEvent ?employmentEvent .
  ?employee a :Cl_Employee .
  ?hospital :hasEmploymentEventAtHospital ?employmentEvent .
}
```
