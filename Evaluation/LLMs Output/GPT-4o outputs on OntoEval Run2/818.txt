**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a person was first employed at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment and hospitals, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and their employment start date at a specific hospital. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital ?employmentDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :employmentDate ?employmentDate .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
}
```
