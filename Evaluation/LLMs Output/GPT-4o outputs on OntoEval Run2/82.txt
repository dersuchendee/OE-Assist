**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the specific dates when a theatre festival took place. The ontology includes a `date` property for `Cl_TheatreFestival`, but there is no instance data or specific festival information provided in the ontology to answer the CQ directly. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information about theatre festivals and their dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :date ?date . }
}
```
