**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a person was first employed at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment, hospitals, and people, but it lacks a direct connection or property that specifies the start date of employment at a particular hospital. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the employment records of a person, but it will not include the specific start date.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?employment ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment :hospital ?hospital .
}
```
