**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the employment date of a person at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the specific hospital where they are employed, along with the employment date.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?employmentDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentDate ?employmentDate .
}
```
