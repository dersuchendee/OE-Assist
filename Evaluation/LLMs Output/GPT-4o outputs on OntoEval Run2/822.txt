**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a person was first employed at a specific hospital. The ontology includes information about employment and hospitals, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the start date of their employment at a specific hospital. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which retrieves the employment start date for a person, but it does not specify the hospital:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
}
```
