**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the employment of a person at a hospital, specifically the start date of employment. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, medical degrees, hospitals, and employment, but it lacks the specific data property or object property that would directly link a person to their employment start date at a hospital.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :employee ?person .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
}
```

This query retrieves the person and the hospital they are employed at, but it does not provide the employment start date, which is necessary to fully answer the competency question.
