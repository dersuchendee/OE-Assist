**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the employment of a person at a hospital, such as the start date of employment. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the person and the hospital they are associated with.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :employmentOf ?person .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
}
```
