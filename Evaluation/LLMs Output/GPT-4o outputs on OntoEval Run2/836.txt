The competency question "In what city is a certain hospital located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate hospitals to cities, specifically through the `op_isLocatedIn` object property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :op_isLocatedIn ?city .
  ?city :dp_cityName ?cityName .
}
```
