**No**

The ontology does not contain any direct information about the specific dates of theatre festivals. It only contains information about festival occurrences and their dates, but not specifically about theatre festivals. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the dates of festival occurrences.

```sparql
SELECT ?festivalOccurrence ?date
WHERE {
  ?festivalOccurrence a :Cl_FestivalOccurrence .
  ?festivalOccurrence :hasDate ?date .
}
```
