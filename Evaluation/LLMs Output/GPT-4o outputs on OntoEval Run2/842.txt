**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a hospital with a city. The ontology includes classes and properties related to hospitals, locations, and cities, but it lacks a direct property or path that connects a hospital to a specific city. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?location
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?location .
}
```
