**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the city in which a hospital is located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to hospitals, locations, and cities, but there is no explicit connection between a hospital and a city. The closest connection is between a hospital and a location, and a location and a country, but not directly to a city.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?location
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?location .
}
```
