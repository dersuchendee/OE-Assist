**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the city in which a hospital is located. The ontology includes a property `:locatedIn` that relates a hospital to a city, but there is no information about the specific city for each hospital. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?city
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital :locatedIn ?city . }
}
```
