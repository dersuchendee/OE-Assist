The competency question "In what city is a certain hospital located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate hospitals to cities, specifically through the `:locatedIn` object property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}
```
