**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate hospitals with cities. Although there is a `locatedIn` property that connects hospitals to cities, the ontology does not contain any instances or data that would allow us to answer the competency question directly. Therefore, we can only provide a partial answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?city
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital :locatedIn ?city . }
}
```
