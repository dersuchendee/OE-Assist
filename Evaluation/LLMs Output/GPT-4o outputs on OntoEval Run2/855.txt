**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a hospital with a specific city. While there is a `locatedIn` property that connects hospitals to cities, the ontology does not contain instances or data that would allow us to answer the competency question directly. Therefore, we can only provide a partial answer by listing hospitals without their city locations.

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
}
```
