**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the specific dates of theatre festivals. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, and their occurrences, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific festival and its occurrence date. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?occurrence a :Cl_FestivalOccurrence ;
                :hasDate ?date .
  }
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve festivals and their occurrence dates, but without a direct link between the festival and its occurrence, it may not provide complete information.
