**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the country in which a city is located. The ontology includes classes for cities and countries, and there is an object property `:isLocatedIn` that connects cities to countries. However, there is no data or instances provided in the ontology to answer the competency question directly. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by listing the cities and their associated countries if such data were available.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :isLocatedIn ?country . }
}
```
