The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" is not fully supported by the provided ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties related to cities and countries, but it does not provide a direct way to query the country of a specific city. However, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the cities and their associated countries, assuming that such data exists in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
  ?country a :Country .
}
```
