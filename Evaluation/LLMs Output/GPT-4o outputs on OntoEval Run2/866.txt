**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the country in which a city is located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to locations, cities, and countries, but it lacks a direct connection between a city and its country. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which retrieves cities and their locations:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?location
WHERE {
  ?location a :Cl_Location .
  ?location :city ?city .
}
```
