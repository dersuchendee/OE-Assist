**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and a country, which is necessary to answer the competency question. However, we can extract a partial answer by identifying the city associated with a hospital.

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
}
```
