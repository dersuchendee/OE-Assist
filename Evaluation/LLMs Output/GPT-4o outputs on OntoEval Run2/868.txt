The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to determine the country in which a city is located. Specifically, the `:isInCountry` object property connects a `:Cl_Location` (which can represent a city) to a `:Cl_Country`.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?cityName ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_Location ;
        :cityName ?cityName ;
        :isInCountry ?country .
  ?country :countryName ?countryName .
}
```
