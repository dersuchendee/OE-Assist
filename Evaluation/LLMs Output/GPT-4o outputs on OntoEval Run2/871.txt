**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the country in which a city is located. However, we can extract partial information about the city and its associated hospital.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?hospital ?hospitalLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
}
```
