**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and the country it is located in. However, we can extract partial information about cities and their associated countries.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?city :cityInCountry ?country .
    OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
  }
}
```
