The competency question "When did a certain theatre festival take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate to theatre festivals and their dates, allowing us to extract the required information.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festivalName ?eventDate
WHERE {
  ?festival rdf:type :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :festivalName ?festivalName ;
            :hasFestivalEvent ?event .
  ?event :hasDate ?date .
  ?date :eventDate ?eventDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the name of the theatre festival and the date it took place by navigating through the relationships defined in the ontology.
