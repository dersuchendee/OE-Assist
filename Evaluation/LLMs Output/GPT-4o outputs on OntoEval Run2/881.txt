**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the members of a union at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employees, unions, and union memberships, but it lacks temporal information about union memberships. The `unionRepresentativeSince` property provides temporal information for union representatives, but there is no equivalent for general union membership.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?employee ?union
WHERE {
  ?employee a :Employee .
  ?employee :hasUnionMembership ?unionMembership .
  ?unionMembership collectionentity:hasMember ?employee .
  ?employee :representsUnion ?union .
}
```
