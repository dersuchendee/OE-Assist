**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to relate union members to a specific point in time. The ontology includes properties like `hasMemberAt` and `memberOfAt`, but they are not fully utilized in the given ontology to capture temporal membership information. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying union members without considering the time aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union
WHERE {
  ?person a :UnionMember .
  ?person :memberOf ?union .
}
```
