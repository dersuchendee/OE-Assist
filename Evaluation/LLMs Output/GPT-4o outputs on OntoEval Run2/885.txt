**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and time points, but it lacks a direct connection between union members and specific time points. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for union memberships without considering the time aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?employee ?union
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?membership :hasEmployee ?employee .
  ?membership :hasUnion ?union .
}
```
