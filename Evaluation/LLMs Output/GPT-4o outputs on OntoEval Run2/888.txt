**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between union membership and specific time points. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :inUnion ?union .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves individuals who are members of a union, along with their membership start and end dates, but it does not filter by a specific point in time.
