**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a direct way to associate these with specific time points. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?unionMembership .
  ?unionMembership :union ?union .
  OPTIONAL { ?unionMembership :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?unionMembership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate . }
}
```
