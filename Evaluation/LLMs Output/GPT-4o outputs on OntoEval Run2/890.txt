**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a direct connection to a specific point in time for union membership. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?unionMembership .
  ?unionMembership a :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?unionMembership :memberOf ?union .
  OPTIONAL { ?unionMembership :membershipDate ?membershipDate . }
}
```
