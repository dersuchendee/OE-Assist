**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks temporal information about when a person was a member of a union. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information about union memberships:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?membershipStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasUnionMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :memberOf ?union .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
}
```
