**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership, but it lacks temporal information about when a person was a member of a union. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for union members without considering the time aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :unionMember ?person ;
              :memberOfUnion ?union .
}
```
