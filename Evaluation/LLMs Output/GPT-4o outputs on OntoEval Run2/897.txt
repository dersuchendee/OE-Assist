**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership, but it lacks temporal information about the membership duration. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information about union memberships:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union
WHERE {
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?membership :membershipOf ?person .
  ?membership :memberOf ?union .
}
```
