**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a direct connection to a specific point in time for querying purposes. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_PersonUnionMembership .
  ?membership :memberOf ?union .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate . }
  ?membership rdfs:subClassOf :Cl_Person .
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
}
```

This query retrieves union members and their membership periods, but it does not filter by a specific point in time.
