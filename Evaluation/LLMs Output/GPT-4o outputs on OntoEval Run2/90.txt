**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the specific dates when a theatre festival took place. The ontology includes a class `Cl_FestivalOccurrence` with a property `occurrenceDate`, but there is no direct connection between a specific theatre festival and its occurrence date. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for the occurrence dates associated with any theatre festival occurrence.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?occurrenceDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :occurrenceDate ?occurrenceDate .
}
```
