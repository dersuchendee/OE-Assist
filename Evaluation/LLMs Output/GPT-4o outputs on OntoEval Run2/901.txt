**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a direct way to query for members at a specific time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists union members without considering the time aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?membership :hasMember ?person .
  ?membership :memberOf ?union .
}
```
