**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a direct way to associate a person with a union at a specific time. The ontology does not have a temporal aspect for union membership, which is necessary to answer the competency question.

Partial SPARQL query to extract union members without considering time:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipUnion ?union .
}
```
