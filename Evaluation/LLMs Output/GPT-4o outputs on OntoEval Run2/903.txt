**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the role of a person within a union group at a specific time, which can be extracted using the provided ontology structure. Here's the SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?unionGroup ?role ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person :hasRoleMembership ?roleMembership .
  ?roleMembership :roleMembershipIn ?unionGroup .
  ?roleMembership :roleOfMembership ?role .
  ?roleMembership :roleStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?roleMembership :roleEndDate ?endDate . }
  
  FILTER (?startDate <= "2023-10-01"^^xsd:date && (!BOUND(?endDate) || ?endDate >= "2023-10-01"^^xsd:date))
}
```
