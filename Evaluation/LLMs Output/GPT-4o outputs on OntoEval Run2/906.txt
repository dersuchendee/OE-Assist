**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes information about union membership and roles, but it lacks a temporal component to specify the time at which a person holds a particular role within a union.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?union
WHERE {
  ?person a ns1:Person .
  ?person ns1:hasRole ?role .
  ?role ns1:roleInUnion ?union .
}
```
