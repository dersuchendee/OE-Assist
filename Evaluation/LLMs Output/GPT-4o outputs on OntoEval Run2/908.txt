**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and role assignments, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, the union group, and the specific time point. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?unionGroup
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasUnionRoleAssignment ?roleAssignment .
  ?roleAssignment :isAssignmentOfRole ?role .
  ?roleAssignment :isAssignmentInUnionGroup ?unionGroup .
}
```
