The competency question "What role does a certain person have within a certain union group at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for a person's role within a union group and the time period during which they held that role.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?unionGroup ?startTime ?endTime
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasUnionRole ?role .
  ?person :partOfUnionGroup ?unionGroup .
  ?person :hasUnionMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :unionMembershipDuring ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :startTime ?startTime .
  ?timePeriod :endTime ?endTime .
}
```
