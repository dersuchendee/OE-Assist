**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and the specific union group at a given time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?union ?roleStartDate ?roleEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasRole ?unionRole .
  ?unionRole :roleInUnion ?union .
  ?unionRole :roleName ?role .
  OPTIONAL { ?unionRole :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?unionRole :roleEndDate ?roleEndDate . }
}
```
