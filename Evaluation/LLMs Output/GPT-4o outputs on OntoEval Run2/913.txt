**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a temporal component to capture the role at a specific point in time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?unionMembership .
  ?unionMembership :memberOf ?union .
  ?person :hasRole ?unionRole .
  ?unionRole :hasRole ?role .
}
```
