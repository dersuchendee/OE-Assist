**No**

The ontology does not provide explicit information about the roles a person has within a union group at a specific point in time. While the ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, it lacks the temporal aspect necessary to answer the competency question fully. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?roleName
WHERE {
  ?role rdf:type :Cl_UnionRole .
  ?role :roleHolder ?person .
  ?role :hasUnionRole ?union .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
}
```
