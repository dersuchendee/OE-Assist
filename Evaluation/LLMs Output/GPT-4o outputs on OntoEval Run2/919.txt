**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a direct temporal component to associate roles with specific time points. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information about union roles:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?roleName
WHERE {
  ?unionMembership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
                   :unionMember ?person ;
                   :memberOf ?union ;
                   :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
}
```
