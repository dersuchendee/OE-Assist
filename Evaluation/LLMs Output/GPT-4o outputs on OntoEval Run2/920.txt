**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a temporal component to specify the role at a certain point in time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?roleTitle
WHERE {
  ?membership :membershipOf ?person .
  ?membership :memberOf ?union .
  ?role :hasRole ?membership .
  ?role :roleTitle ?roleTitle .
}
```
