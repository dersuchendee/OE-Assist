**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a direct connection to specify the role of a person within a union group at a specific time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?roleStartDate ?roleEndDate
WHERE {
  ?personUnionRole a :Cl_PersonUnionRole .
  ?personUnionRole :hasRole ?role .
  ?personUnionRole :memberOf ?union .
  ?personUnionRole :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?personUnionRole :roleEndDate ?roleEndDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves the person, union, role, and the start and end dates of the role, but it does not directly answer the competency question regarding the role at a specific point in time.
