**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a direct connection to time-specific role assignments within union groups.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?union
WHERE {
  ?roleAssignment a :Cl_UnionRoleAssignment .
  ?roleAssignment :roleOf ?person .
  ?roleAssignment :hasRole ?role .
  ?roleAssignment :roleInUnion ?union .
}
```
