**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific evaluation statement with a specific doctor and employee. The ontology defines the relationships between doctors, employees, and evaluation statements, but it does not specify how to query for a particular evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?doctor ?employee ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  ?doctor a :Doctor .
  ?doctor :hasEvaluation ?evaluationStatement .
  ?evaluationStatement :evaluationOf ?employee .
}
```
