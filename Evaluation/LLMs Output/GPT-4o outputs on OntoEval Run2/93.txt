The competency question "When did a certain theatre festival take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to determine the date of a theatre festival. Specifically, the `:Cl_TheatreFestival` class is connected to the `:Cl_Date` class through the `:hasDate` object property, and the `:Cl_Date` class has a `:dateValue` datatype property that holds the date information.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasDate ?dateNode .
  ?dateNode :dateValue ?date .
}
```
