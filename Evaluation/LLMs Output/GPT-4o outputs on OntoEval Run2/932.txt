**No**

The ontology does not contain any classes or properties related to evaluation statements given by doctors for employees. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the provided ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying doctors and employees, but without the evaluation statement details.

```sparql
SELECT ?doctor ?employee
WHERE {
  ?doctor a :Doctor .
  ?employee a :Employee .
  ?doctor :evaluates ?employee .
}
```
