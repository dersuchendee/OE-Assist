**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to retrieve evaluation statements given by a doctor for a specific employee. The ontology includes classes and properties related to people, medical degrees, employment, and union memberships, but it lacks the necessary connections between doctors, employees, and evaluation statements.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying employees and evaluation statements, but without the specific connection to doctors:

```sparql
SELECT ?employee ?evaluationText
WHERE {
  ?employee a :Cl_Employee .
  ?evaluationStatement a :Cl_EvaluationStatement .
  ?evaluationStatement :givenTo ?employee .
  OPTIONAL { ?evaluationStatement :evaluationText ?evaluationText . }
}
```
