**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific doctor with an evaluation statement for a specific employee. The ontology includes classes and properties related to evaluation statements and doctors, but it lacks the necessary connections to answer the competency question directly. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?employee ?evaluationText
WHERE {
  ?employee a :Cl_Person .
  ?employee :hasEvaluation ?evaluation .
  ?evaluation a :Cl_EvaluationStatement .
  OPTIONAL { ?evaluation :evaluationText ?evaluationText . }
}
```

This query retrieves evaluation statements associated with employees, but it does not specify which doctor provided the evaluation.
