**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific theatre festival took place. The ontology includes a `hasDate` property for `Cl_TheatreFestival`, but without specific instances or data, we cannot extract the exact date of a particular festival. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :hasDate ?date . }
}
```
