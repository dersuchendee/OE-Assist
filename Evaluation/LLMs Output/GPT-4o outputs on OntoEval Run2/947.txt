The competency question "What is the evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to represent evaluations, doctors, and employees, as well as the evaluation statements.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee:

```sparql
SELECT ?doctor ?employee ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  ?evaluation a :Cl_EvaluationAssignment .
  ?evaluation :evaluatedBy ?doctor .
  ?evaluation :evaluates ?employee .
  ?evaluation :evaluationStatement ?evaluationStatement .
}
```

This query retrieves the doctor, employee, and the evaluation statement from the ontology, which aligns with the competency question.
