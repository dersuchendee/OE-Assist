The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for `Book`, `CD`, and `Article`, and there is a property `hasArticle` that connects `Book` and `CD` to `Article`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the articles contained within a specific book or CD.

```sparql
SELECT ?collection ?collectionLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?collection a ?collectionType .
  FILTER (?collectionType IN (:Book, :CD))
  OPTIONAL { ?collection rdfs:label ?collectionLabel . }

  ?collection :hasArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
```
