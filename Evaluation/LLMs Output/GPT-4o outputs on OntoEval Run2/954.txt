**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine which articles a specific book or CD is composed of. The ontology includes classes and properties related to publications, books, CDs, and articles, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific book or CD and the articles it contains. The closest property, `:containsArticle`, connects a publication to an article, but it does not specify whether the publication is a book or a CD.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists publications and the articles they contain:

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?article
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  ?publication :containsArticle ?article .
}
```
