The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate publications, books, CDs, and articles. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?article
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_Publication .
  ?bookOrCD :contains ?article .
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
}
```

This query retrieves the articles contained within a specific book or CD by leveraging the `:contains` object property, which connects publications to articles.
