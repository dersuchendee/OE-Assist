**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine which articles a specific book or CD is composed of. The ontology includes classes and properties related to media, articles, and article collections, but it does not explicitly connect a specific book or CD to the articles it contains. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the relationship between media and article collections:

```sparql
SELECT ?media ?articleCollection
WHERE {
  ?media a :Cl_Media .
  ?media :composedOf ?articleCollection .
}
```
