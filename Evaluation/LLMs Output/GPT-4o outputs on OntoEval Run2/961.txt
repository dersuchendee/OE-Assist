**Yes**

The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Publication` with the object property `composedOfArticles` that links to the class `Cl_Article`. This allows us to query for articles that are part of a specific publication.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?publicationTitle ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication ;
               :publicationTitle ?publicationTitle ;
               :composedOfArticles ?article .
  ?article a :Cl_Article ;
           :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
}
```
