**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine which articles a specific book or CD is composed of. However, we can extract partial information about articles and their collections.

```sparql
SELECT ?article ?articleTitle ?collection
WHERE {
  ?collection a :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  ?collection :containsArticle ?article .
  ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
}
```
