The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Book` and `Cl_CD`, both of which have the object property `containsArticle` that links them to the class `Cl_Article`. This allows us to query for articles contained within a specific book or CD.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?article
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a ?type .
  FILTER(?type IN (:Cl_Book, :Cl_CD))
  ?bookOrCD :containsArticle ?article .
}
```
