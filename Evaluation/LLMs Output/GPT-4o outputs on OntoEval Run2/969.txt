**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine which articles a specific book or CD is composed of. However, we can extract partial information about publications and articles.

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?article
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  ?publication :containsArticle ?article .
}
```
