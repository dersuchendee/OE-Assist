**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine which specific articles a book or CD is composed of. The ontology includes a property `:containsArticle` that relates books and CDs to articles, but it does not specify which articles are part of a specific book or CD. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some information about books and CDs containing articles:

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?article
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a [owl:unionOf(:Cl_Book :Cl_CD)] .
  ?bookOrCD :containsArticle ?article .
}
```
