The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a `hasNumberOfPages` datatype property that associates a book with its number of pages. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract this information.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?bookLabel ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?book rdfs:label ?bookLabel . }
  ?book :hasNumberOfPages ?numberOfPages .
}
```
