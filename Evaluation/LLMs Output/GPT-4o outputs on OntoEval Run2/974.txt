The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to books and their page counts. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the number of pages for a particular book:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?title ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :dp_hasTitle ?title .
  ?book :dp_hasPageCount ?pageCount .
}
```

This query retrieves the book's title and the number of pages it contains, which directly answers the competency question.
