The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `:Book` and the datatype property `:pageNumber`, which relates a book to the number of pages it contains. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the number of pages for a particular book.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?pageNumber
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book .
  ?book :pageNumber ?pageNumber .
}
```
