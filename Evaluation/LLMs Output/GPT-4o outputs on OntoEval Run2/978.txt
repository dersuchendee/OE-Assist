The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a `:Book` class with a `:pageCount` datatype property, which allows us to query the number of pages in a book.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the number of pages for a particular book:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book .
  ?book :pageCount ?pageCount .
}
```
