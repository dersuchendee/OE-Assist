**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a festival. The ontology includes classes and properties related to festivals, cities, and theatre productions, but it lacks a direct connection between a festival and its location. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?festival :occursIn ?city .
  }
}
```
