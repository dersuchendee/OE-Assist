**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the number of pages of a particular book. The ontology includes a property `:numberOfPages` with domain `:Cl_Book`, but there is no direct connection between a specific book instance and this property in the provided ontology. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for books and their number of pages, but it won't be specific to a particular book without additional information.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages .
}
```
