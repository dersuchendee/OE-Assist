**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the number of pages a particular book contains. The ontology includes classes and properties related to books and their details, but it does not explicitly connect a book to its number of pages. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which retrieves books and their details, but it won't provide the number of pages:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?details
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?book :hasDetails ?details . }
}
```
