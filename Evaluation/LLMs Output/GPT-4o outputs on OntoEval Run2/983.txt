The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Book` with a data property `:pageNumber` that specifies the number of pages a book contains. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the number of pages for a particular book:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?title ?pages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :publicationTitle ?title .
  ?book :pageNumber ?pages .
}
```

This query retrieves the book's title and the number of pages for each book in the ontology.
