The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a `:pageCount` datatype property that is associated with the `:Cl_Book` class, which allows us to query the number of pages a book contains.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the number of pages for a particular book:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?bookLabel ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book rdfs:label ?bookLabel .
  ?book :pageCount ?pageCount .
}
```
