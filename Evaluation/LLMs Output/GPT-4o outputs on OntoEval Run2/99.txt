**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a festival with a specific location, as the property `tookPlaceIn` is used to associate a festival with a city, but the ontology does not have a direct link between a festival and a specific location within a city. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a ns1:TheatreFestival .
  ?festival ns1:tookPlaceIn ?city .
}
```
