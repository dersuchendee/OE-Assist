The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Book` with a data property `:pageCount` that specifies the number of pages a book contains. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract this information.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :pageCount ?pageCount .
}
```
