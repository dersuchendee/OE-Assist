The competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides information about books and CDs, their publication events, and the publication dates. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the publication date of a specific book or CD:

```sparql
SELECT ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?publicationEvent a :Cl_PublicationEvent ;
                    :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
  {
    ?book a :Cl_Book ;
          :hasPublicationEvent ?publicationEvent .
    FILTER(?book = :bookNursePracticesInCancerPatientCare)
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?cd a :Cl_CD ;
        :hasPublicationEvent ?publicationEvent .
    FILTER(?cd = :cdNursePracticesInCancerPatientCare)
  }
}
```

This query retrieves the publication date of the book or CD specified by the individual `:bookNursePracticesInCancerPatientCare` or `:cdNursePracticesInCancerPatientCare`.
