**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a specific book or CD. The ontology includes classes and properties related to books, CDs, and publication events, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific book or CD and its publication date. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for books and CDs, but without the publication date.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?cd
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?cd a :Cl_CD .
}
```
