**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a specific book or CD. However, we can extract partial information about publications and their types.

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?publicationType
WHERE {
  ?publication a ns1:Publication .
  OPTIONAL { ?publication a ?publicationType . }
}
```
