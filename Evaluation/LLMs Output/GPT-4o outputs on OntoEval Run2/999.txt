**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a specific book or CD. However, we can extract partial information about the publication dates of article collections in general.

```sparql
SELECT ?articleCollection ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?articleCollection a :ArticleCollection .
  ?articleCollection :hasPublicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```
