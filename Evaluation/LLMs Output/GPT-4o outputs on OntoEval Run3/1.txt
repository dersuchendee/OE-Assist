**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the subject of a source. The ontology defines a `hasSubject` property, but there are no instances or data provided to demonstrate its use. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the available data related to sources and facts.

```sparql
SELECT ?source ?subject
WHERE {
  ?source a :Source .
  OPTIONAL { ?source :hasSubject ?subject . }
}
```
