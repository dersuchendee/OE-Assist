**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a musical instrument and its physical realization. The object property `op_hasPhysicalRealization` connects `Cl_MusicalInstrument` to `Cl_InstrumentRealization`, but there is no further information or properties provided to extract specific details about the physical realization of an instrument.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?instrument ?realization
WHERE {
  ?instrument a :Cl_MusicalInstrument .
  ?instrument :op_hasPhysicalRealization ?realization .
}
```
