**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the location of a specific festival. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, productions, and locations, but it does not explicitly link a specific festival to a specific location. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a theatre:TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?festival theatre:hasLocation ?location .
  }
}
```
