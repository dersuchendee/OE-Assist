**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a book or CD. The ontology includes classes for publications, books, and CDs, but it lacks a direct property to associate these with a publication date. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for the titles of books and CDs, but not their publication dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?title
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  ?publication :title ?title .
}
```
