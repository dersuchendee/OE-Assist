**No**

The ontology provided does not include any information about the publication dates of books or CDs. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about books and CDs without their publication dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?cd
WHERE {
  OPTIONAL {
    ?book a :Book .
  }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?cd a :CD .
  }
}
```
