**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the publication date of a book or CD. The ontology includes a `:publicationDate` property, but it is associated with a `:Cl_Publication` class, which is not directly linked to `:Cl_BookOrCD`. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_BookOrCD .
  ?bookOrCD :published ?publication .
  ?publication :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```
