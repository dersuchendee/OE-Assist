**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the publication date of books or CDs. However, it does contain information about the publication date of a specific publication, which is a book in this case. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted for the publication date of the book "Nurse practices in cancer patient care â€“ longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals".

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?publicationTitle ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication ;
               :publicationTitle ?publicationTitle ;
               :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
