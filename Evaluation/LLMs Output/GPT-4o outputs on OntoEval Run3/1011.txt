**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the publication date of a specific book or CD. However, we can extract partial information about article collections, which are subclasses of books and CDs, and their publication dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?articleCollection ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?articleCollection a :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  OPTIONAL { ?articleCollection :publicationDate ?publicationDate . }
}
```
