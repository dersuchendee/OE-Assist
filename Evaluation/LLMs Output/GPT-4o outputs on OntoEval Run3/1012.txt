The ontology does not contain any information about the publication date of books or CDs. However, we can extract partial information about the articles and books available in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?bookTitle ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :bookTitle ?bookTitle .
  ?book :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages .
}
