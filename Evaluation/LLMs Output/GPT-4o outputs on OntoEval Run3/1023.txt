**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific seminar took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars, seminar occurrences, and locations, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific seminar and its date. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information about seminars and their occurrences:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarOccurrence ?location ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminarOccurrence a :Cl_SeminarOccurrence .
  ?seminarOccurrence :relatesToSeminar ?seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminarOccurrence :tookPlaceAt ?location . }
  OPTIONAL { ?seminarOccurrence :hasDate ?date . }
}
```
