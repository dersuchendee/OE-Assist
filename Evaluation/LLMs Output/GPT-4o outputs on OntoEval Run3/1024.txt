**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about seminars or their dates. Therefore, the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial query can be constructed to retrieve events and their dates, but it will not specifically identify seminars.

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?eventDate
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  ?event :eventDate ?eventDate .
}
```
