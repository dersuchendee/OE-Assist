**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific seminar took place. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Seminar` and a data property `seminarDate`, but there is no direct connection between a specific seminar instance and its date. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for seminars, but without specific dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
}
```
