**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link articles to seminars. The ontology includes classes for articles, article collections, and seminars, but it lacks a direct relationship between articles and the seminars in which they are presented. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the seminars held at a hospital, but not the specific articles presented in those seminars.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :holdsSeminar ?seminar .
  ?seminar :hasDate ?seminarDate .
}
```
