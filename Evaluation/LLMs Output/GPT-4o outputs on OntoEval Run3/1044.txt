**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate articles with seminars. While there is a `presentedArticle` property that links a `Presentation` to an `Article`, and a `partOfSeminar` property that links a `Presentation` to a `Seminar`, there is no direct link between `Article` and `Seminar`. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying presentations that are part of a seminar and the articles they present:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?presentation ns1:partOfSeminar ?seminar .
  ?presentation ns1:presentedArticle ?article .
}
```
