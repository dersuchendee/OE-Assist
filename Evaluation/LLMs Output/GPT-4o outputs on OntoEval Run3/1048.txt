**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate articles with seminars. The ontology includes classes for seminars, articles, and article collections, but it lacks a direct relationship between seminars and the articles presented in them. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying seminars and articles separately, but not the specific articles presented in a particular seminar.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
}
```
