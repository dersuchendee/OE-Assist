**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link articles to seminars. The ontology includes classes and properties related to articles, books, and seminars, but it lacks a direct connection between articles and the seminars in which they are presented. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying articles and seminars separately, but not the specific articles presented in a particular seminar.

```sparql
SELECT ?article ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
}
```
