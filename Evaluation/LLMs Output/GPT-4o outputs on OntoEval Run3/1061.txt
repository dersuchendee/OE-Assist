**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate articles with specific seminars. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars and articles, but it lacks a direct connection between a seminar and the articles presented in it. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying seminars and articles separately, but not their association.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
}
```
