**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a seminar with a specific location beyond the hospital level. The ontology includes a `heldAt` property that links a seminar event to a hospital, but it does not specify a more granular location within the hospital or city. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_SeminarEvent .
  ?seminar :heldAt ?hospital .
}
```
