**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the specific locations where festivals take place, other than the city. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only provide partial information about the city where a festival occurred.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_Festival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :takesPlaceIn ?city .
}
```
