**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about the location of seminars. It includes classes and properties related to events, seminars, and places, but there is no direct connection between seminars and their locations. Therefore, the competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying seminars, but without their locations.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
}
```
