The competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to seminars and their locations, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the location of a seminar.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?location ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :heldAt ?location .
  ?location :cityName ?cityName .
}
```

This query retrieves the seminar, its location, and the city name where the seminar took place. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to answer this competency question.
