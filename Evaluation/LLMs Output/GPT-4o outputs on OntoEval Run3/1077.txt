The competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Seminar` and the object property `takesPlaceAt`, which connects a seminar to a hospital. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the location of a seminar.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :takesPlaceAt ?hospital .
}
```
