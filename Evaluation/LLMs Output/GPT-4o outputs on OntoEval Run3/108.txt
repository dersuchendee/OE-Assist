**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a festival. The ontology includes a `dp_location` property for `Cl_TheatreFestival`, but it is not used in the individuals or relationships provided. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the `dp_location` property for `Cl_TheatreFestival` instances.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :dp_location ?location . }
}
```
