**No**

The ontology does not contain any direct information about the location of seminars. However, it does contain information about seminar presentations and their relationships to articles and seminars. A partial answer can be extracted by identifying the seminar and its associated location, but the specific location of the seminar is not directly modeled in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?hospitalLocation
WHERE {
  ?seminar rdf:type :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminarLocation :locationOfSeminar ?seminar .
  ?seminarLocation :locatedAt ?hospitalLocation .
}
```
