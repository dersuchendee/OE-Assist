**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a seminar. While there is a `heldAt` property that connects a seminar to a hospital, there is no direct connection to a specific location or city where the seminar took place. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the hospital where the seminar was held, but not the specific location.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :heldAt ?hospital .
}
```
