**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a seminar. While there is a property `:seminarLocatedIn` that connects a seminar to a hospital, there is no direct connection to a geographic location such as a city or country. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract the hospital where a seminar took place:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarLocatedIn ?hospital .
}
```
