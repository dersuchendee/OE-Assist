**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a seminar. The `seminarLocation` property is defined, but there is no connection between a seminar and a specific location in the ontology. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?location
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar :seminarLocation ?location . }
}
```
