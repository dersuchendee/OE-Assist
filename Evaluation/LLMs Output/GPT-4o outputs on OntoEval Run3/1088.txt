**Yes**

The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Seminar` class that ensures each seminar must have at least one article presented. This is represented by the `owl:someValuesFrom` restriction on the `hasArticle` property. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to verify that each seminar has at least one article presented.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasArticle ?article .
}
```

This query will return all seminars and their associated articles, confirming that each seminar has at least one article presented.
