**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a festival. The ontology includes information about theatre festivals, plays, and their occurrences, but it does not explicitly link festivals to specific locations. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :tookPlaceIn ?city . }
}
```
