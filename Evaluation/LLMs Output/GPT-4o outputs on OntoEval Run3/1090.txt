**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model the requirement that at least one article is always presented at each seminar. However, we can extract information about seminars and their presentations, but it won't confirm the condition of "at least one article always presented."

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?presentation ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a ns1:Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
  ?seminar ns1:hasPresentation ?presentation .
  OPTIONAL { ?presentation ns1:presentedArticle ?article . }
}
```
