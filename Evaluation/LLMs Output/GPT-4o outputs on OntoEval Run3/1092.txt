**Yes**

The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Seminar` with a restriction that ensures each seminar has at least one article presented, as indicated by the `hasPresentedArticle` property. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to verify this:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentedArticle ?article .
}
```

This query will return all seminars and their associated articles, confirming that each seminar has at least one article presented.
