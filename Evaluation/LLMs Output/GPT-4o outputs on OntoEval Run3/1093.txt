The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `:Seminar` with a restriction that ensures each seminar has at least one `:Article` presented, as indicated by the `:hasPresentedArticle` property with a minimum qualified cardinality of 1. This allows us to verify that every seminar has at least one article presented.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract seminars and their presented articles:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentedArticle ?article .
}
```

This query retrieves all seminars and the articles presented at each seminar, confirming that each seminar has at least one article presented.
