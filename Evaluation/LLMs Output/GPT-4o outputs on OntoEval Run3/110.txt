**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the location of the festival. However, we can extract partial information about the festival occurrences.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?occurrence
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasFestivalOccurrence ?occurrence .
}
```
