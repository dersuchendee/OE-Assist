The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Cl_Seminar` class that ensures each seminar has at least one article presented, as indicated by the `:presentedIn` property with a minimum cardinality of 1. This means that every instance of `Cl_Seminar` must have at least one associated `Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation`, which in turn must have an `articlePresented`.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that each seminar has at least one article presented:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
  ?presentation a :Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation .
  ?presentation :presentedIn ?seminar .
  ?presentation :articlePresented ?article .
}
```

This query retrieves all seminars along with their dates and the articles presented in them, ensuring that each seminar has at least one article associated with it.
