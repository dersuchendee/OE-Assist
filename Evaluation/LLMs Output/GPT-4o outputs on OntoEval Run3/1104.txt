**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model the relationship between seminars and articles being presented at them. While there is a class `Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation` and properties like `:articlePresentedIn` and `:presentationOfArticle`, there is no direct connection to ensure that at least one article is always presented at each seminar. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract information about articles presented in seminars:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?presentation rdf:type :Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation .
  ?presentation :articlePresentedIn ?seminar .
  ?presentation :presentationOfArticle ?article .
}
```
