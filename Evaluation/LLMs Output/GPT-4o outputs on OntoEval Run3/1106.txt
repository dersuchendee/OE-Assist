**Yes**

The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction that ensures each seminar contains at least one article presentation. This can be verified using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :containsPresentationOf ?presentation .
  ?presentation a :Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation .
  ?presentation :presentedIn ?seminar .
  ?presentation a :Cl_Article .
}
```
