The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction that ensures each seminar has at least one article presented. Here's a SPARQL query to extract seminars and their associated articles:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasArticle ?article .
}
```
