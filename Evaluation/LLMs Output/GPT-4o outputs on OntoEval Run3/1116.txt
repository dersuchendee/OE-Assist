**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the sequence of actions performed by the user. The ontology focuses on specific actions, locations, and times, but it does not capture the sequence or history of actions. However, we can extract partial information about actions performed by the user.

```sparql
SELECT ?user ?action ?location ?time
WHERE {
  ?user a :Cl_User .
  ?user :op_performedAction ?userAction .
  ?userAction :op_actionType ?action .
  ?userAction :op_inLocation ?location .
  ?userAction :op_duringTime ?time .
}
```
