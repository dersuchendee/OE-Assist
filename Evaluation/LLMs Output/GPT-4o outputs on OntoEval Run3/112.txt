**No**

The ontology does not contain information about the location of festivals, which is required to answer the competency question. However, we can extract partial information about the festivals themselves.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :festivalName ?festivalName .
}
```
