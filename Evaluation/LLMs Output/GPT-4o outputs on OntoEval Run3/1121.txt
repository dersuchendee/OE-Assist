**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the current time or compare it with the abstract time definitions. It only defines abstract time concepts and associates them with users. A partial answer can be extracted by listing the abstract time definitions for a user.

```sparql
SELECT ?abstractTime ?startTime ?endTime
WHERE {
  :User1234 :hasAbstractTimeDefinition ?abstractTime .
  ?abstractTime :hasStartTime ?startTime .
  ?abstractTime :hasEndTime ?endTime .
}
```
