**No**

The ontology does not provide information about specific weather services or their configurations. It only defines a property `:providesService` that connects a weather service to personalized weather information. There is no instance data or further details about specific weather services like www.yr.no or their configurations.

Partial answer SPARQL query:
```sparql
SELECT ?weatherService
WHERE {
  ?weatherService a :Cl_WeatherService .
}
```
