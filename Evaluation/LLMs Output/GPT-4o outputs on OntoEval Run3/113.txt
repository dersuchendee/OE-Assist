**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a festival. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, occurrences, locations, plays, and other related concepts, but it does not explicitly connect a festival to a specific location where it took place. The closest we have is the `:hasLocation` property, but it is not directly linked to a specific city or venue in the ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasLocation ?location .
  ?location :locationName ?locationName .
}
```

This query retrieves the location names associated with theatre festivals, but it does not specify the exact place where a festival took place.
