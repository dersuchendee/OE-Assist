**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as it is possible to extract the required information using a SPARQL query. The ontology provides classes and properties that relate to user preferences, weather services, locations, and time periods, which are all relevant to the competency question.

```sparql
SELECT ?service ?location ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?userPreference a :UserPreference .
  ?userPreference :preferredService ?service .
  ?userPreference :preferredLocation ?location .
  ?userPreference :preferredTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
```
