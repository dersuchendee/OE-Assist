The competency question "What devices are available in this indoor location?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides a class `IndoorLocation` and a class `Device`, with an object property `hasDevice` that links an indoor location to the devices available in it. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the devices available in a specified indoor location.

```sparql
SELECT ?device ?deviceLabel
WHERE {
  :Berlin :hasDevice ?device .
  OPTIONAL { ?device rdfs:label ?deviceLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves the devices available in the indoor location represented by the individual `:Berlin`. The `OPTIONAL` clause is used to get the labels of the devices if they are available.
