**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a festival. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, cities, and locations, but it does not explicitly connect a specific festival to a specific location. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :locatedIn ?city .
}
```
