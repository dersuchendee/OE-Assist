**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a user with their preferred movie categories. The ontology includes classes for users, movie categories, and user preferences, but it lacks a direct connection between a user and their preferred movie categories. The ontology uses a reification class `Cl_UserPreference` to connect users to their preferences, but the competency question asks for a direct association between users and movie categories, which is not explicitly modeled in the ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?user ?categoryName
WHERE {
  ?user :hasPreference ?preference .
  ?preference :prefersMovieCategory ?category .
  ?category :hasCategoryName ?categoryName .
}
```
