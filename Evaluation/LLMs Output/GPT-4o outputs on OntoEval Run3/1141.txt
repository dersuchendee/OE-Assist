The competency question "What are the preferred movie categories of the current user?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a class `User` with an object property `hasPreference` that links a user to their preferred `MovieCategory`. The individual `CurrentUser` is defined with a preference for `ActionMovie`, which is a subclass of `MovieCategory`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the preferred movie categories of the current user.

```sparql
SELECT ?category ?categoryLabel
WHERE {
  :CurrentUser :hasPreference ?category .
  OPTIONAL { ?category rdfs:label ?categoryLabel . }
}
```
