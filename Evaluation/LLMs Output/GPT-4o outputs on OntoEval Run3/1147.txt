The competency question "What are the free time periods in the userâ€™s calendar today?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that represent events and free time periods within a calendar, along with their start and end times. We can write a SPARQL query to extract the free time periods from the user's calendar for a specific day.

```sparql
SELECT ?freeTimePeriod ?startTime ?endTime
WHERE {
  :MyCalendar :hasFreeTimePeriod ?freeTimePeriod .
  ?freeTimePeriod a :FreeTimePeriod ;
                  :startTime ?startTime ;
                  :endTime ?endTime .
  FILTER (STRSTARTS(STR(?startTime), "2023-04-01"))
}
ORDER BY ?startTime
```
