**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the attributes of an event category such as a movie having a genre and a set of actors. The ontology only defines classes and properties related to movie screenings, cinemas, and movies, but it does not include specific attributes like genre or actors for movies.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?movie ?title
WHERE {
  ?movie a :Cl_Movie .
  OPTIONAL { ?movie :hasTitle ?title . }
}
```
