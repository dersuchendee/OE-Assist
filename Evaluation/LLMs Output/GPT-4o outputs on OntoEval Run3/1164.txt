The competency question "What is the quantity of a flow at a specific time?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to query for the quantity of a flow at a specific time through the `Flow`, `FlowObservation`, `hasQuantityValue`, and `atTime` properties.

```sparql
SELECT ?flow ?quantity ?time
WHERE {
  ?flow a :Flow .
  ?flow :hasFlowObservation ?observation .
  ?observation :hasQuantityValue ?quantity .
  ?observation :atTime ?time .
}
```
