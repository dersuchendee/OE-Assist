**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the effects on external social and environmental factors. The ontology defines classes and properties related to implementation actions and their effects on external factors, but it does not specify the effects themselves or how they relate to specific social or environmental factors.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?implementationAction ?effect ?externalFactor
WHERE {
  ?implementationAction a :ImplementationAction .
  ?implementationAction :hasEffect ?effect .
  ?effect :affectsFactor ?externalFactor .
}
```
