**No**

The ontology does not provide specific instances or details about the energy infrastructure available. It only defines classes and properties related to energy infrastructure and its availability status. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only extract partial information about the classes and properties defined in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?energyInfrastructure ?status
WHERE {
  ?energyInfrastructure a :EnergyInfrastructure .
  OPTIONAL { ?energyInfrastructure :hasAvailabilityStatus ?status . }
}
```
