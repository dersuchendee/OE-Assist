**Yes**

The competency question "Was the (material, information) exchange successful?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for `MaterialExchange` and `InformationExchange`, both of which are subclasses of `Exchange`. The `Exchange` class has a property `hasSuccessStatus` that indicates whether the exchange was successful. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract this information.

```sparql
SELECT ?exchange ?exchangeType ?successStatus
WHERE {
  ?exchange a ?exchangeType .
  FILTER(?exchangeType IN (:MaterialExchange, :InformationExchange))
  ?exchange :hasSuccessStatus ?successStatus .
}
```
