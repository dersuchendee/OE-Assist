**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate specific data with a particular point in time for an energy flow. The ontology defines the classes and properties but does not include instances or specific data points that can be queried. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying energy flows and their associated data and time points, but not the specific data at a given time.

```sparql
SELECT ?energyFlow ?data ?timePoint
WHERE {
  ?energyFlow a :EnergyFlow .
  ?energyFlow :hasData ?data .
  ?energyFlow :atTime ?timePoint .
}
```
