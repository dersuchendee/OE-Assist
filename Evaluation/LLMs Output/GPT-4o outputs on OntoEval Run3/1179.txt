**Yes**

The competency question can be answered by the ontology as it includes classes and properties that allow us to determine the play methods of a set of bells. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?setOfBells ?playMethod
WHERE {
  ?setOfBells a :SetOfBells .
  ?setOfBells :hasPlayMethod ?playMethod .
  FILTER(?playMethod IN (:ManualPlayMethod, :ElectricPlayMethod))
}
```
