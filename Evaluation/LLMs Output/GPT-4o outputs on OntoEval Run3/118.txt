**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about the specific location where a festival took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, cities, and locations, but there is no direct connection or data property that specifies the exact location of a festival. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?locationCity
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :locatedIn ?location .
  ?location :locationCity ?locationCity .
}
```

This query will return the city associated with each theatre festival, but it does not specify the exact location where a specific festival took place.
