**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the specific locations where a female musician performed. The ontology includes classes and properties related to musicians, performances, and locations, but it does not explicitly connect female musicians to specific performance locations. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list performances by female musicians without specifying the location:

```sparql
SELECT ?femaleMusician ?performance
WHERE {
  ?femaleMusician a :FemaleMusician .
  ?femaleMusician :hasPerformed ?performance .
}
```
