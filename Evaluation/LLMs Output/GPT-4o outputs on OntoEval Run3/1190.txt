**No**

The ontology does not provide specific properties or instances that would allow us to determine whether an event was a celebration, festival, or private event. The classes are defined, but without instances or properties to distinguish them, we cannot answer the CQ fully. However, we can extract a partial answer by listing all events.

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?eventType
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?event a ?eventType .
    FILTER(?eventType IN (:Celebration, :Festival, :PrivateEvent))
  }
}
```
