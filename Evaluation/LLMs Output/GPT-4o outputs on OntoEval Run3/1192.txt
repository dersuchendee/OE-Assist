The competency question "Who paid to support the event?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:paidToSupport` property, which links an `:Agent` (either a `:Person` or an `:Organization`) to an `:Event`. This allows us to query for agents who have paid to support events.

```sparql
SELECT ?agent ?agentLabel ?event ?eventLabel
WHERE {
  ?agent a :Agent .
  ?agent :paidToSupport ?event .
  OPTIONAL { ?agent rdfs:label ?agentLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?event rdfs:label ?eventLabel . }
}
```
