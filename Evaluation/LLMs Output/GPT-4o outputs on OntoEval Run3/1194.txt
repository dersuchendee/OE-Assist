The competency question "Did they travel to reach the place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for `Person`, `Travel`, and `Place`, and properties that connect them, such as `participatedInTravel` and `hasDestination`. This allows us to query whether a person has participated in travel to a specific place.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?place
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :participatedInTravel ?travel .
  ?travel :hasDestination ?place .
}
```
