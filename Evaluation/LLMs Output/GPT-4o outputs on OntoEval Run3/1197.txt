The ontology supports the competency question regarding power relations, specifically through the properties `hasPowerOver` and its sub-properties like `patronOf` and `supervises`. These properties establish power relations between individuals, such as between patrons and musicians or supervisors and their supervisees.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract power relations:

```sparql
SELECT ?person1 ?person1Label ?relation ?person2 ?person2Label
WHERE {
  ?person1 a :Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person1 rdfs:label ?person1Label . }

  ?person1 ?relation ?person2 .
  ?relation rdfs:subPropertyOf :hasPowerOver .

  ?person2 a :Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person2 rdfs:label ?person2Label . }
}
```
