The competency question "What are all compositions in tune family X?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the classes `Composition` and `TuneFamily`, and the object property `hasTuneFamily` which connects compositions to tune families. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the compositions belonging to a specific tune family.

```sparql
SELECT ?composition ?compositionLabel
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition .
  ?composition :hasTuneFamily :X .  # Assuming :X is the specific tune family URI
  OPTIONAL { ?composition rdfs:label ?compositionLabel . }
}
```
