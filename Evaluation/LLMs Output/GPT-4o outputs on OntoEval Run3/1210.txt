**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to compare compositions within a tune family based on a specific measure. The ontology defines classes and properties for compositions, tune families, measures, and measure values, but it lacks the necessary structure to directly compare compositions based on a specific measure within a tune family.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?composition ?measure ?value
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition .
  ?composition :isInTuneFamily :TuneFamilyX .
  ?composition :hasMeasureValue ?measureValue .
  ?measureValue :isMeasureOf ?measure .
  ?measureValue :hasValue ?value .
}
```
