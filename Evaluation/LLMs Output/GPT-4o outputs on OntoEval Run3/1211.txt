**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology. We can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer by querying the `SimilarityRelation` class and its associated properties.

```sparql
SELECT ?relatedTuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?similarityRelation a :SimilarityRelation .
  ?similarityRelation :hasSourceTuneFamily :TuneFamilyX .
  ?similarityRelation :hasTargetTuneFamily ?relatedTuneFamily .
  ?similarityRelation :hasSimilarityMeasure :SimilarityMeasureY .
}
```
