**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for specific chemical characteristics associated with aquatic microbe species. The ontology defines a relationship between aquatic microbe species and environments with chemical characteristics, but it does not specify how to query for specific chemical characteristics.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?microbeSpecies ?environment
WHERE {
  ?microbeSpecies a :AquaticMicrobeSpecies .
  ?microbeSpecies :isFoundInEnvironment ?environment .
}
```
