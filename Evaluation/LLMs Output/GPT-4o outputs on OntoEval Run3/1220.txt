The competency question "Which microbial functional guilds are present in a specific aquifer ecosystem?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to connect aquifer ecosystems with microbial functional guilds through observations. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?aquiferEcosystem ?guild
WHERE {
  ?observation a :MicrobialPresenceObservation .
  ?observation :isObservationOf ?aquiferEcosystem .
  ?observation :hasObservedGuild ?guild .
}
```
