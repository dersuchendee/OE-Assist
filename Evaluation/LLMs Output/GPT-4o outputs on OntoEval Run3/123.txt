**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between theatre festivals and the plays that can be seen during them. The ontology includes classes and properties for TheatreFestival, TheatreProduction, and Play, but it lacks a direct property or relationship that links a TheatreFestival to the specific Plays that are part of it. The ontology does have a property chain axiom (theatre:hasPlayInFestival) that connects TheatreFestival to Play through TheatreProduction, but there is no instance data that uses this property chain to link specific plays to specific festivals.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists the productions associated with a festival, but not the specific plays:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?festival a theatre:TheatreFestival .
  ?festival theatre:hasProduction ?production .
  ?production theatre:hasPlay ?play .
}
```
