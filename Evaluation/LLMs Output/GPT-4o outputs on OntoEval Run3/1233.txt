**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the relationship between beech forests, carbon sequestration, and the carbon cycle, which are all represented in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?beechForest ?process ?cycle
WHERE {
  ?beechForest a :BeechForest .
  ?beechForest :hasProcess ?process .
  ?process a :CarbonSequestration .
  ?process :contributesTo ?cycle .
  ?cycle a :CarbonCycle .
}
```
