**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying for major processes involved in the nitrogen cycle within beech forest ecosystems. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to construct such a query.

```sparql
SELECT ?process ?processLabel
WHERE {
  ?process a :MajorProcess .
  ?process :involvedIn :NitrogenCycle .
  ?process :occursIn :BeechForestEcosystem .
  OPTIONAL { ?process rdfs:label ?processLabel . }
}
```
