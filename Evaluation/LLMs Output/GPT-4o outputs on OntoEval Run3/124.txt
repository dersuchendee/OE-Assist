**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct relationships or properties that connect plays to theatre festivals. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, festival occurrences, plays, and productions, but it lacks a direct connection between plays and theatre festivals. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying productions that have festival participations, but this does not directly link to specific plays being seen during a theatre festival.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?production
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasFestivalParticipation ?participation .
  ?production :hasProductionParticipation ?participation .
}
```
