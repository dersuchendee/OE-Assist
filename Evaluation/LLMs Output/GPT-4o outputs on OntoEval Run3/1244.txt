The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves retrieving contaminated sites, their geographical areas, and the time of observation, all of which are represented in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?contaminatedSite ?area ?observationTime
WHERE {
  ?contaminatedSite a :ContaminatedSite .
  ?contaminatedSite :hasObservation ?observation .

  ?observation :observedInArea ?area .
  ?observation :hasObservationTime ?observationTime .
}
```
