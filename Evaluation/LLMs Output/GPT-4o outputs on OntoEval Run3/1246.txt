**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a parameter and the quality of water bodies. The ontology defines a class `WaterQualityParameter` that is a subclass of `Parameter` and is related to `WaterBody` through the `representsQualityOf` property. However, the competency question asks for a specific parameter that represents the quality of water bodies, which is not explicitly defined in the ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?parameter
WHERE {
  ?parameter a :WaterQualityParameter .
}
```
