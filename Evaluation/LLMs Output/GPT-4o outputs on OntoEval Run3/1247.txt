**Yes**

The competency question "When is the level of a chemical substance recorded in a water body?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to extract the observation times of chemical substances in water bodies.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?waterBody ?chemicalSubstance ?measurementTime
WHERE {
  ?waterBody a :WaterBody .
  ?waterBody :hasObservation ?observation .
  ?observation a :ChemicalSubstanceObservation .
  ?observation :isObservationOfWaterBody ?waterBody .
  ?observation :isObservationOfChemicalSubstance ?chemicalSubstance .
  ?observation :hasMeasurementTime ?measurementTime .
}
ORDER BY ?waterBody ?chemicalSubstance ?measurementTime
```
