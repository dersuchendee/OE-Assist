The competency question "Which codes correspond to each disease category?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology defines a `DiseaseCategory` class that has a relationship with the `Code` class through the `hasCode` property. Each `Code` can have a `codeValue`, which is a string. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the disease categories and their corresponding codes.

```sparql
SELECT ?diseaseCategory ?code ?codeValue
WHERE {
  ?diseaseCategory a :DiseaseCategory .
  ?diseaseCategory :hasCode ?code .
  ?code :codeValue ?codeValue .
}
```
