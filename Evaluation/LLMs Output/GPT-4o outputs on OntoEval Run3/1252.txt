**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the spatial distribution of measurements across different areas. It only defines the relationships between areas and measurements but does not include spatial data or properties that would allow for querying spatial distribution.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?area ?measurement
WHERE {
  ?area a :Area .
  ?area :hasMeasurement ?measurement .
}
```
