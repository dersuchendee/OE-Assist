**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as it involves retrieving information about water quality parameters observed at monitoring sites and the times these observations were recorded. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to model this information.

```sparql
SELECT ?monitoringSite ?observation ?parameter ?time
WHERE {
  ?monitoringSite a :MonitoringSite .
  ?monitoringSite :hasObservation ?observation .

  ?observation a :WaterQualityObservation .
  ?observation :observesParameter ?parameter .
  ?observation :recordedAtTime ?time .
}
```
