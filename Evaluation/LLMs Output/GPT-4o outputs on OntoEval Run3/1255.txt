**No**

The ontology does not have a direct connection between chemical measurements and their concentration values in water. The ontology defines a `ChemicalMeasurement` class with a `hasConcentrationValue` property, but it does not specify that these measurements are specifically related to water. The `inMedium` property connects `ChemicalMeasurement` to `Water`, but there is no explicit link to concentration values in water.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?chemicalMeasurement ?concentrationValue
WHERE {
  ?chemicalMeasurement a :ChemicalMeasurement .
  ?chemicalMeasurement :hasConcentrationValue ?concentrationValue .
}
```
