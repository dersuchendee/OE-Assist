**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to trace the complete path of a material through all processes it undergoes. While it does allow for the identification of a material's origin and the processes it undergoes, it lacks a mechanism to trace the entire sequence of processes in a connected manner. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the origin and the first process a material undergoes:

```sparql
SELECT ?material ?origin ?firstProcess
WHERE {
  ?material a :Material .
  ?material :hasOrigin ?origin .
  ?material :undergoesProcess ?firstProcess .
}
```
