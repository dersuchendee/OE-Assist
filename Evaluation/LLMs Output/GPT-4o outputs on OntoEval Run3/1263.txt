**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to connect effects to specific external social and environmental factors. The ontology only defines that effects can affect external factors, but it does not specify which specific factors are affected by which effects. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?effect ?externalFactor
WHERE {
  ?effect a :Effect .
  ?effect :affectsFactor ?externalFactor .
}
```
