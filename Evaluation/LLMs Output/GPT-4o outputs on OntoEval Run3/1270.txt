**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific point in time with an energy flow. The ontology defines `EnergyFlow` and `EnergyData` classes, and the `EnergyData` class has a `hasTimestamp` property. However, the competency question asks for the data of an energy flow at a specific point in time, which implies a need for a direct association between `EnergyFlow`, `EnergyData`, and a specific timestamp. The ontology does not explicitly model this association.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?energyFlow ?energyData ?timestamp
WHERE {
  ?energyFlow a :EnergyFlow .
  ?energyFlow :hasData ?energyData .
  ?energyData :hasTimestamp ?timestamp .
}
```
