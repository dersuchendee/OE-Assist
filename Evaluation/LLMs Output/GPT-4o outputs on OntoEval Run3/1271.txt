**No**

The ontology does not provide any information about the efficiency of processes. It only describes the types of information required by a collaboration process. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about the types of information required by a collaboration process.

```sparql
SELECT ?process ?infoType
WHERE {
  ?process a :CollaborationProcess .
  ?process ?property ?infoType .
  FILTER(?property IN (:requiresInfrastructureInfo, :requiresProcessInfo, :requiresEnergyRecoveryInfo, :requiresStakeholderInfo, :requiresEnergyDemandSurplusInfo, :requiresValueInfo))
}
```
