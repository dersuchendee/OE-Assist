**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a musician and the location of their performance. The ontology defines a `PerformanceEvent` class that is associated with a `Location` through the `performedAt` property, but there is no direct link between a `Musician` and a `Location`. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?performanceEvent ?location
WHERE {
  ?performanceEvent a :PerformanceEvent .
  ?performanceEvent :performedAt ?location .
}
```
