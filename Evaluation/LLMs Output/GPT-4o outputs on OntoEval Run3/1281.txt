**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to extract the specific location where a person lived. The ontology includes a `ResidenceEvent` class, which is a subclass of `Event`, and events can have locations. However, there is no direct connection between a `Person` and a `Location` through a `ResidenceEvent`. The ontology would need to explicitly model the relationship between a person and their residence location to fully answer the CQ.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?person ?location
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :hasEvent ?event .
  ?event a :ResidenceEvent .
  ?event :atLocation ?location .
}
```
