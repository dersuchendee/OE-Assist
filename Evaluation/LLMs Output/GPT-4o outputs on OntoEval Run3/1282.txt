The competency question "Did musician X and performer Y ever meet? Where, when, and why?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for meetings involving specific participants, as well as the location, time, and reason for these meetings.

Here is a SPARQL query that can be used to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?meeting ?location ?time ?reason
WHERE {
  ?meeting a :Meeting .
  ?meeting :hasParticipant ?musician .
  ?meeting :hasParticipant ?performer .
  ?musician a :Musician .
  ?performer a :Performer .
  ?meeting :hasLocation ?location .
  ?meeting :hasTime ?time .
  ?meeting :hasReason ?reason .
  FILTER(?musician = <http://www.example.org/test#MusicianX> && ?performer = <http://www.example.org/test#PerformerY>)
}
```

Replace `<http://www.example.org/test#MusicianX>` and `<http://www.example.org/test#PerformerY>` with the actual URIs of the musician and performer you are interested in. This query will return the meetings where both the specified musician and performer participated, along with the location, time, and reason for the meeting.
