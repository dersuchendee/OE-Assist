**No**

The ontology does not provide any properties or data that can be used to determine whether an event is religious or secular. The classes `ReligiousEvent` and `SecularEvent` are defined, but there is no information or properties in the ontology to distinguish between them for a given event instance.

Partial SPARQL query to list events without determining their type:

```sparql
SELECT ?event
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
}
```
