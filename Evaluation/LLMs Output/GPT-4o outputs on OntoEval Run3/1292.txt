The competency question "Was there a power relation?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `PowerRelation` and its associated properties `hasSuperior`, `hasSubordinate`, and `hasRelationType`, which are sufficient to determine if a power relation exists between individuals.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?powerRelation ?superior ?subordinate ?relationType
WHERE {
  ?powerRelation a :PowerRelation .
  ?powerRelation :hasSuperior ?superior .
  ?powerRelation :hasSubordinate ?subordinate .
  ?powerRelation :hasRelationType ?relationType .
}
```
