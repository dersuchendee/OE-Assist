**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the places where musicians played, as it lacks a direct connection between musicians and places outside of events. However, we can extract a partial answer by querying for events and their locations, which indirectly involves musicians.

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?place
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  ?event :hasLocation ?place .
}
```
