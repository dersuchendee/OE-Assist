The competency question "Where were the musicians coming from?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Musician` and the object property `comesFrom` which links musicians to the class `Place`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the required information.

```sparql
SELECT ?musician ?place
WHERE {
  ?musician a :Musician .
  ?musician :comesFrom ?place .
}
```
