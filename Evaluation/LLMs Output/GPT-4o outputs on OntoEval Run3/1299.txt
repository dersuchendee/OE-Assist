The competency question "What are the original parts of the organ?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Organ` with a property `hasOriginalPart` that relates an organ to its original parts, which are instances of the class `Part`.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the original parts of each organ:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?originalPart
WHERE {
  ?organ a :Organ .
  ?organ :hasOriginalPart ?originalPart .
}
```
