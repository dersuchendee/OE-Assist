The competency question "Which are the parts of an instrument?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines a class `MusicalInstrument` and a class `InstrumentPart`, with a relationship `hasPart` that connects a musical instrument to its parts. This allows us to query for the parts of a musical instrument.

```sparql
SELECT ?instrument ?part
WHERE {
  ?instrument a :MusicalInstrument .
  ?instrument :hasPart ?part .
}
```
