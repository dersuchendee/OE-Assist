**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link plays to a specific theatre festival. The ontology includes classes and properties related to festivals, plays, and their appearances, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific festival and the plays that can be seen during it. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists the plays and their appearances, but not linked to a specific festival:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?title
WHERE {
  ?playAppearance a :Cl_PlayAppearance .
  ?playAppearance :isPlayOf ?play .
  ?play :hasTitle ?title .
}
```
