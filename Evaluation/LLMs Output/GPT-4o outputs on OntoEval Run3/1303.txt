**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the confidence level of a composition being a variant in a tune family, which is represented by the `VariantAssertion` class in the ontology. The `VariantAssertion` class connects compositions and tune families and includes a confidence level.

```sparql
SELECT ?composition ?tuneFamily ?confidenceLevel
WHERE {
  ?variantAssertion a :VariantAssertion .
  ?variantAssertion :relatesComposition ?composition .
  ?variantAssertion :relatesTuneFamily ?tuneFamily .
  ?variantAssertion :hasConfidenceLevel ?confidenceLevel .
}
```
