**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link aquatic microbes to specific chemical characteristics of environments. The ontology defines classes for `Species`, `AquaticMicrobe`, `Environment`, and `ChemicalCharacteristic`, but it lacks a direct connection between `AquaticMicrobe` and `ChemicalCharacteristic` through the `Environment`. The `isFoundIn` property connects `Species` to `Environment`, but there is no property that directly connects `AquaticMicrobe` to `ChemicalCharacteristic`.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?microbe ?environment
WHERE {
  ?microbe a :AquaticMicrobe .
  ?microbe :isFoundIn ?environment .
}
```
