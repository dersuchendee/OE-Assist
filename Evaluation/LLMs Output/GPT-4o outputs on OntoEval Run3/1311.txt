**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it is possible to extract the subclasses of the major classes "Aquatic Microbe" and "Aquatic Fungi" using a SPARQL query.

```sparql
SELECT ?majorClass ?subClass ?subClassLabel
WHERE {
  VALUES ?majorClass { :AquaticMicrobe :AquaticFungi }
  ?subClass rdfs:subClassOf ?majorClass .
  OPTIONAL { ?subClass rdfs:label ?subClassLabel . }
}
```
