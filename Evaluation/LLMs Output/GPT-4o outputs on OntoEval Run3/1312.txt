**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to compare the composition of microbial and fungal communities between different habitats. However, we can extract partial information about the compositions of habitats.

```sparql
SELECT ?habitat ?composition ?microbialCommunity ?fungalCommunity
WHERE {
  ?habitat a :Habitat .
  ?habitat :hasComposition ?composition .
  ?composition :hasMicrobialCommunity ?microbialCommunity .
  ?composition :hasFungalCommunity ?fungalCommunity .
}
```
