**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for plays that can be seen during a specific theatre festival. The ontology includes information about theatre festivals, festival occurrences, and play participations, but it lacks a direct connection between a festival and the plays that are part of it. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists the plays that have participated in any festival occurrence:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasFestivalOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :hasPlayParticipation ?participation .
  ?participation :participatedPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves the plays that have participated in any festival occurrence, but it does not filter by a specific festival or provide a direct answer to the competency question.
