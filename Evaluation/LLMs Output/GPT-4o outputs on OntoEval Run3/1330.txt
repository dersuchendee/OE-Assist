**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it includes classes and properties that describe the transport of substances, such as dissolved carbon, between different environmental compartments like soil and groundwater. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?source ?destination ?substance
WHERE {
  ?process a :TransportProcess .
  ?process :hasSource ?source .
  ?process :hasDestination ?destination .
  ?process :transportsSubstance ?substance .
  
  ?substance a :DissolvedCarbon .
}
```
