**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying the major processes involved in the nitrogen cycle within beech forest ecosystems. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to model this query.

```sparql
SELECT ?process ?processLabel
WHERE {
  ?ecosystem a :BeechForestEcosystem .
  ?ecosystem :hasMajorProcess ?process .
  OPTIONAL { ?process rdfs:label ?processLabel . }
}
```
