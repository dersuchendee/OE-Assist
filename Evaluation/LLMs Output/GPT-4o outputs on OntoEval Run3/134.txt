**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate plays with specific theatre festivals. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, and productions, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific festival and the plays that can be seen during that festival. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by listing the plays associated with the festival, but it does not confirm if they were seen during the festival.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :festivalName ?festivalName ;
            :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
```
