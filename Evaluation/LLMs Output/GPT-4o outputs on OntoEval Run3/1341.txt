The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves querying for parameters that represent the quality of water bodies, which is directly modeled in the ontology with the class `WaterQualityParameter` and its relationship to `WaterBody`. Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?parameter ?parameterLabel
WHERE {
  ?parameter a :WaterQualityParameter .
  OPTIONAL { ?parameter rdfs:label ?parameterLabel . }
}
```
