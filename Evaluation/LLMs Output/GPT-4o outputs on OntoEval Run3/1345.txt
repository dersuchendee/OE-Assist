**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as it is possible to write a SPARQL query to extract the answer. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to determine the hospital with the longest average length of stay for a particular disease category.

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel (MAX(?averageLengthOfStay) AS ?maxAverageLengthOfStay)
WHERE {
  ?statistic a :HospitalStatistic .
  ?statistic :hasAverageLengthOfStay ?averageLengthOfStay .
  ?statistic :forDiseaseCategory ?diseaseCategory .
  ?statistic :recordedBy ?hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
}
GROUP BY ?hospital ?hospitalLabel
ORDER BY DESC(?maxAverageLengthOfStay)
LIMIT 1
```
