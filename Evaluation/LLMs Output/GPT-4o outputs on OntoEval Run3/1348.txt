**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to connect chemical and physical measurements to specific areas or spatial distributions. The ontology defines classes and properties related to measurements, spatial distribution, and areas, but it lacks the necessary connections to answer the competency question fully. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?measurement ?area
WHERE {
  ?measurement a :Measurement .
  ?measurement :locatedInArea ?area .
}
```
