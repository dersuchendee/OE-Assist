**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it involves retrieving concentration values of chemical measurements in water, which is directly represented in the ontology through the `ChemicalMeasurement` class and its associated properties. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?chemicalMeasurement ?chemical ?waterSource ?concentrationValue
WHERE {
  ?chemicalMeasurement a :ChemicalMeasurement .
  ?chemicalMeasurement :hasConcentrationValue ?concentrationValue .
  ?chemicalMeasurement :ofChemical ?chemical .
  ?chemicalMeasurement :measuredIn ?waterSource .
}
```
