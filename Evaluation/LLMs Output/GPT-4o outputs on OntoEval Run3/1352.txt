**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between chemical measurements and their units of measure. The ontology defines a class `ChemicalMeasurement` and a property `hasUnit`, but there is no connection to the `Measurement` class or any indication that chemical measurements are part of the monitoring process. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?chemicalMeasurement ?unit
WHERE {
  ?chemicalMeasurement a :ChemicalMeasurement .
  ?chemicalMeasurement :hasUnit ?unit .
}
```
