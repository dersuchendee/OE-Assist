**No**

The ontology provided does not explicitly define a way to identify which parts of an organ are original. The ontology includes classes and properties related to organs, their parts, and their descriptions, but it does not include any specific properties or classes that denote the originality of a part. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the parts of an organ, but without determining their originality:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?part
WHERE {
  ?organ a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
  ?organ <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/includesPart> ?part .
}
```
