**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any properties or classes that directly relate to the original location of an organ. The ontology primarily describes the components and relationships of organs, such as parts, actions, and roles, but does not include information about the geographic or original location of an organ.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?part
WHERE {
  ?organ a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
  ?organ <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/includesPart> ?part .
}
```

This query retrieves organs and their parts, but it does not provide information about the original location of the organ.
