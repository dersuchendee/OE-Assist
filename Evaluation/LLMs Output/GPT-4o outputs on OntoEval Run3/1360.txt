**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the sources of the project that an organ is involved in. The ontology includes classes and properties related to organs, projects, and their components, but it lacks explicit properties or relationships that connect a project to its sources. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying projects related to organs, but not their sources.

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?project
WHERE {
  ?organ a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
  ?organ <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/isDescribedBy> ?project .
}
```
