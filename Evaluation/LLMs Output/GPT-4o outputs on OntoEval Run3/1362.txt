**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct mention or property related to "organ" in the context of resources mentioning an organ. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to organs using the available classes and properties.

```sparql
SELECT ?resource
WHERE {
  ?resource a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
}
```

This query will return resources that are classified as "Organ" in the ontology, but it does not directly answer the competency question about resources mentioning an organ.
