**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to recordings or sound practices involving bells or sets of bells. The ontology primarily focuses on the structural aspects of bells, bell towers, and sets of bells, without any mention of sound practices or recordings. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the bells and sets of bells, as these are the only relevant entities in the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?bell ?setOfBells
WHERE {
  ?bell a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/Bell> .
  ?bell <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/isComponentOf> ?setOfBells .
}
```
