**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes related to measurements of bells. It only defines classes for Bell, BellTower, and SetOfBells, with some restrictions on their relationships. Therefore, the competency question "Which are the measures of the bell?" cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the bells and their associated sets.

```sparql
SELECT ?bell ?setOfBells
WHERE {
  ?bell a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/Bell> .
  ?bell <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/isComponentOf> ?setOfBells .
}
```
