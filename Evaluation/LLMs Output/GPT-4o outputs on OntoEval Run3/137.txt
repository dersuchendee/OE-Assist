**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct connection between theatre festivals and the plays that can be seen during them. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, and their occurrences, but it lacks a direct link between a specific festival and the plays that are part of it. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only provide a partial answer by listing plays without associating them with specific festivals.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
}
```
