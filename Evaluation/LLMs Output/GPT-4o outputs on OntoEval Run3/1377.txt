**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for specific musicians or performers by name, nor does it provide a way to directly query for the reason for their meeting. However, we can extract partial information about meetups, including participants, places, and times.

```sparql
SELECT ?meetup ?participant ?place ?time ?purpose
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasParticipant ?participant .
  ?meetup mtps:hasPlace ?place .
  ?meetup mtps:happensAt ?time .
  ?meetup mtps:hasAPurpose ?purpose .
}
```
