**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct connection between theatre festivals and the plays that can be seen during them. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, and their occurrences, but it lacks a direct link between a specific festival and the plays that are part of it. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?play
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasPlay ?festivalPlay .
  ?festivalPlay :playName ?play .
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve festivals and associated plays, but without a direct link to specific theatre festivals, it cannot fully answer the competency question.
