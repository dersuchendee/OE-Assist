**No**

The ontology does not provide specific information about the type of event (celebration, festival, private event) directly. The ontology includes a class `mtps:Purpose` with individuals like `mtps:BusinessCareer`, `mtps:Coincidence`, `mtps:Education`, `mtps:MusicMaking`, `mtps:PersonalLife`, and `mtps:PublicCelebration`, but it does not explicitly categorize events as celebrations, festivals, or private events. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted based on the available purposes.

```sparql
SELECT ?meetup ?purpose
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasAPurpose ?purpose .
}
```
