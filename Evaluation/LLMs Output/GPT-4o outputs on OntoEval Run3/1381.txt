**No**

The ontology does not include any properties or classes related to financial support or sponsorship of events. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question "Who paid to support the event?" using the given ontology. However, a partial query can be constructed to retrieve information about meetups and participants, which might be useful if additional data about financial support were available.

```sparql
SELECT ?meetup ?participant
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasParticipant ?participant .
}
```
