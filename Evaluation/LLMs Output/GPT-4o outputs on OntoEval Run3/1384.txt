**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to extract the places where the meetups took place. The ontology defines a `hasPlace` property for `Meetup`, but it does not provide specific instances or data about the places. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?meetup ?place
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasPlace ?place .
}
```
