**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to identify if a composition is a variant within a tune family. The ontology includes classes for `Tune`, `TuneFamily`, and `LyricsFamily`, but there is no explicit relationship or property that indicates a composition's variant status within a tune family. 

A partial SPARQL query to extract information about tunes and their families could look like this:

```sparql
SELECT ?tune ?tuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?tune a :Tune .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
    # Assuming there might be a property linking tunes to tune families, which is not defined in the ontology
    # ?tune :isVariantOf ?tuneFamily .
  }
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve tunes and their associated tune families, but without a specific property to indicate variant status, it cannot fully answer the competency question.
