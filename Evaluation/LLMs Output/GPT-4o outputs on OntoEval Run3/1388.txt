**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes related to "confidence" or "variant" that would allow us to determine the level of confidence with which a composition is considered a variant in a tune family. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about compositions and their tune families.

```sparql
SELECT ?composition ?tuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Tune .
  ?composition core:isInvolvedIn ?tuneFamily .
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
}
```
