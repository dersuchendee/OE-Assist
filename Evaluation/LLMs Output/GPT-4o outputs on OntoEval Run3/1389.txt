**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any properties or classes that directly relate to collections within a tune family. The ontology defines `TuneFamily` as a subclass of `core:Collection`, but there are no properties or relationships defined that would allow us to query for all collections within a tune family. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only provide a partial answer by listing all `TuneFamily` instances without detailing their collections.

```sparql
SELECT ?tuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
}
```
