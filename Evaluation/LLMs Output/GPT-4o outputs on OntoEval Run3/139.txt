**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between theatre festivals and the plays that can be seen during them. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, and productions, but it lacks a direct property or relationship that links a specific play to a specific theatre festival. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only provide a partial answer by listing plays and theatre festivals separately without connecting them.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?play
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
}
```
