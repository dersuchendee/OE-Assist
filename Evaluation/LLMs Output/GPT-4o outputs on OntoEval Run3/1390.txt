**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to "measure Y" or any specific measures that could be used to compare compositions within a tune family. The ontology focuses on tunes, tune families, lyrics, and sources, but lacks the necessary detail to address the specific competency question regarding similarities or differences according to a specific measure.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?tuneFamily ?tune
WHERE {
  ?tune a :Tune .
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
  ?tune core:hasSource ?source .
}
```

This query retrieves tunes and their associated tune families, but it does not address the specific measure Y mentioned in the competency question.
