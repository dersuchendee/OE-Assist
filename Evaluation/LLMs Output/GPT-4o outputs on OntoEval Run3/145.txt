**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct relationship between a theatre and the city it is located in. The `isLocatedIn` property connects a theatre to a city, but there is no direct property or class that represents a city in the ontology. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a ns1:Theatre .
  ?theatre ns1:isLocatedIn ?city .
}
```
