**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a theatre with a city. The `isLocatedIn` property connects a theatre to a city, but there is no direct connection from a theatre to a city in the ontology. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :isLocatedIn ?city .
}
```
