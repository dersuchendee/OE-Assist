**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the city in which a specific theatre is located. The ontology includes a `:locatedIn` property that links a theatre to a city, but there is no direct connection between a theatre and a specific city name that can be queried. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :locatedIn ?city .
}
```
