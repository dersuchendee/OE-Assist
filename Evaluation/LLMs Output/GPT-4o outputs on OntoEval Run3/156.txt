**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a theatre and the city it is located in. The ontology includes a `theatreLocation` property that connects a theatre to a city, but there is no direct instance data that specifies which city a specific theatre is located in. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :theatreLocation ?city .
}
```
