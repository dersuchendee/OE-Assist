**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a theatre and its city. However, we can extract partial information about theatres and their locations.

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?theatreName ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?theatre rdf:type :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :theatreName ?theatreName .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?theatreLocation rdf:type :Cl_TheatreLocation .
    ?theatreLocation :hasTheatre ?theatre .
    ?theatreLocation :hasCity ?city .
    ?city :cityName ?cityName .
  }
}
```
