**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a theatre and its city location. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, and locations, but it does not explicitly model the relationship between a theatre and the city it is located in. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :locatedIn ?location .
  ?location a :Cl_TheatreLocation .
  ?location :cityName ?city .
}
```
