**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about the location of a theatre. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and other related entities, but it lacks a direct connection between a theatre and its city location. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
}
```

This query will return the list of theatres, but without their city locations, as that information is not present in the ontology.
