**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about the city in which a theatre is located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and other related concepts, but it lacks a direct connection between a theatre and its city location. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of theatres, but it does not provide information about their city locations, as that information is not present in the ontology.
