**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a theatre and a city. The `isLocatedInCity` property is associated with the `Cl_Theatre` class, but there is no direct link between a theatre and a city in the ontology. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :isLocatedInCity ?city .
}
```
