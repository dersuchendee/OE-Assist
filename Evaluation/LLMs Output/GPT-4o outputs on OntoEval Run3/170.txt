The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_City` and the object property `cityLocatedInCountry` which connects a city to a country. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityLocatedInCountry ?country .
}
```
