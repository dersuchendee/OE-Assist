The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to determine the country in which a city is located. The `City` class is related to the `Country` class through the `isLocatedIn` object property. Therefore, the competency question can be answered using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
}
```
