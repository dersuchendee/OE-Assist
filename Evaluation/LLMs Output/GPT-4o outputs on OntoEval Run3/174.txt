**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and a country. The ontology only specifies that a city is a subclass of a location and that a city can be in a country, but it does not provide a direct property to link a city to a country. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract cities:

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
}
```
