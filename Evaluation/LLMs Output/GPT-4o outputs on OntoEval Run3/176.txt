**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and a country, which is necessary to answer the competency question "In what country is a certain city located?". The ontology only provides a relationship between cities and countries through the `:isLocatedIn` property, but there is no direct data or individuals that specify the country for each city.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :isLocatedIn ?country . }
}
```
