**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the country in which a city is located. However, it does provide information about cities and their labels. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by listing the cities available in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel .
}
```
