**Yes**

The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate cities to countries, specifically through the `Cl_CityCountry` class and the `hasCountry` and `hasCity` object properties.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?cityName ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?cityCountry a :Cl_CityCountry ;
               :hasCity ?city ;
               :hasCountry ?country .
  ?city :cityName ?cityName .
  ?country :countryName ?countryName .
}
```
