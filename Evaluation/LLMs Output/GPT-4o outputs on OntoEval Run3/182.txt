**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and the country it is located in. However, we can extract partial information about cities and their associated countries if such data were available.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?city :isLocatedIn ?cityCountry .
    ?cityCountry :countryName ?country .
  }
}
```
