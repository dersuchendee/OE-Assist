The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate cities to countries, specifically through the `:isLocatedInCountry` object property and the `:countryName` data property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedInCountry ?cityLocation .
  ?cityLocation :countryName ?countryName .
}
```
