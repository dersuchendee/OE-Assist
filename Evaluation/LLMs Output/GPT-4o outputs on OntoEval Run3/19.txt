The competency question "When was an instrument realization built?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `InstrumentRealization` class and the `hasCreationDate` property, which indicates the specific date or time period when an instrument realization was built. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?instrumentRealization ?label ?creationDate
WHERE {
  ?instrumentRealization a :InstrumentRealization .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrumentRealization rdfs:label ?label . }
  ?instrumentRealization :hasCreationDate ?creationDate .
}
ORDER BY ?creationDate
```
