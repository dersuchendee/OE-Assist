**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a theatre production and the play it is based on. The ontology includes classes and properties related to plays, productions, and theatre festivals, but it lacks a specific property that links a production to the play it is based on. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only extract partial information about productions and plays separately.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_TheatreProduction .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?play a :Cl_Play .
  }
}
```
