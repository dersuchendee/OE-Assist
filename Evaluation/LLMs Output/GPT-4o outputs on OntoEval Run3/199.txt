The competency question "What play is the basis of this production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Production` and the object property `isBasedOn` which links a production to a play. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the play that is the basis of a given production.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :isBasedOn ?play .
  ?play :hasTitle ?playTitle .
}
```
