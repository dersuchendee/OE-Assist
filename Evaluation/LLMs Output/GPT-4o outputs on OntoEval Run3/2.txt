**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to assess the credibility of a source. While there is a class `Cl_SourceCredibilityAssessment` and a property `hasCredibilityAssessment`, there is no information on how credibility is determined or what factors contribute to it. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying sources that have a credibility assessment, but the actual credibility level or criteria are not specified.

```sparql
SELECT ?source ?credibilityAssessment
WHERE {
  ?source a :Cl_Source .
  ?source :hasCredibilityAssessment ?credibilityAssessment .
}
```
