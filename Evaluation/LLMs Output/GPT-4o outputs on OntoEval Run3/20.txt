**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between an instrument realization and the person who built it. The ontology includes a class `Cl_InstrumentRealization` and a property `Op_realizedBy` that connects an instrument realization to a person, but there is no property that directly connects an instrument realization to the person who built it. The `Op_builtBy` property connects a musical instrument to a person, but not an instrument realization.

Partial SPARQL query to extract information about instrument realizations and the people who realized them:

```sparql
SELECT ?instrumentRealization ?person
WHERE {
  ?instrumentRealization a :Cl_InstrumentRealization .
  ?instrumentRealization :Op_realizedBy ?person .
}
```
