**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a production and the play it is based on. However, we can extract partial information about productions and their associated plays.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?productionName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
  ?productionPlay a :Cl_ProductionPlay .
  ?productionPlay :hasProduction ?production .
  ?productionPlay :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
```
