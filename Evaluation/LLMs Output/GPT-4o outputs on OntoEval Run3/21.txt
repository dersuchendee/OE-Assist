**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate an instrument realization with its builder. The ontology includes the `InstrumentMaker` class and the `madeBy` property, which relates a `MusicalInstrument` to an `InstrumentMaker`, but it does not include a class or property for an "instrument realization" or a similar concept that would allow us to query for who built a specific realization of an instrument.

However, we can extract partial information about which instruments are made by which makers:

```sparql
SELECT ?instrument ?maker
WHERE {
  ?instrument a :MusicalInstrument .
  ?instrument :madeBy ?maker .
}
```
