**Yes**

The competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to identify ensemble memberships and their time frames. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?ensembleName ?actor ?actorName
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasName ?ensembleName .

  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership .
  ?membership :membershipOf ?ensemble .
  ?membership :member ?actor .
  ?actor :hasName ?actorName .

  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate . }

  FILTER (?startDate <= "2023-10-01"^^xsd:date && (!BOUND(?endDate) || ?endDate >= "2023-10-01"^^xsd:date))
}
ORDER BY ?ensembleName ?actorName
```

This query retrieves the members of ensembles whose membership is valid at a specific point in time (e.g., October 1, 2023). It checks that the membership start date is on or before the specified date and that the end date is either not set or is after the specified date.
