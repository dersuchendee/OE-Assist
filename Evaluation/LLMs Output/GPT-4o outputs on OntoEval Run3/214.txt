**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate ensembles with specific productions at specific points in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for productions, roles, and time-indexed roles, but it lacks a direct connection between ensembles and the productions they participate in at specific times. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?role ?production ?time
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a ns1:Ensemble .
  ?ensemble ns1:hasMember ?member .
  ?member ns1:performsRole ?role .
  ?role ns1:inProduction ?production .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?member ns1:hasTimeInterval ?interval .
    ?interval ns1:startTime ?startTime .
    ?interval ns1:endTime ?endTime .
  }
}
```
