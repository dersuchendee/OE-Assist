**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate ensembles with specific points in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre productions, actors, and ensembles, but it lacks a mechanism to specify the temporal aspect of ensemble membership. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the members of an ensemble without considering the time aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a theatre:Ensemble .
  ?ensemble theatre:hasMember ?member .
}
```
