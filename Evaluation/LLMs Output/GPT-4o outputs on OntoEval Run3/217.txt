**No**

The ontology provided does not include any classes or properties that directly relate to ensembles or their members. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying theatre productions and their associated actors, but this does not directly address the ensemble membership aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?actor
WHERE {
  ?roleAssignment a :RoleAssignment .
  ?roleAssignment :assignedPerson ?actor .
  ?roleAssignment :inProduction ?production .
}
```
