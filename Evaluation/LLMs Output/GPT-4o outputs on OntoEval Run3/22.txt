**No**

The ontology does not directly support querying which water bodies belong to a specific water basin. The ontology provides a reification class `Cl_WaterBodyInBasin` with properties `op_isWaterBodyOf` and `op_isPartOfBasin`, but it does not directly connect `Cl_WaterBody` to `Cl_WaterBasin` through a simple property like `op_belongsTo`. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted using the reification pattern.

```sparql
SELECT ?waterBody ?waterBasin
WHERE {
  ?waterBodyInBasin a :Cl_WaterBodyInBasin .
  ?waterBodyInBasin :op_isWaterBodyOf ?waterBody .
  ?waterBodyInBasin :op_isPartOfBasin ?waterBasin .
}
```
