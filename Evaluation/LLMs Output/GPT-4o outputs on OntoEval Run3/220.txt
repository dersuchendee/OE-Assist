**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to ensembles or their members. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SPARQL query to extract the answer to the competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" based on the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying productions and their associated ensembles, but without specific members:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?ensemble
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :partOf ?production .
}
```
