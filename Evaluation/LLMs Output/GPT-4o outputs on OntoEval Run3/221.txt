**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for members of an ensemble at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to ensembles and members, but it lacks a direct temporal aspect to associate members with ensembles at specific times.

Partial SPARQL query to extract ensemble members without the temporal aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?member .
}
```
