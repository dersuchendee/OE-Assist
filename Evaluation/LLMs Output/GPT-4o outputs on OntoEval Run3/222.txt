**No**

The ontology provided does not contain explicit information about ensembles or their members at specific points in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to festivals, plays, theatres, productions, and individuals, but it lacks the necessary structure to directly answer the competency question regarding ensemble membership at a certain point in time.

However, we can extract partial information about individuals and their ensemble memberships, but without the temporal aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?individual ?individualName ?ensemble
WHERE {
  ?individual a :Cl_Individual .
  ?individual :hasName ?individualName .
  ?individual :memberOf ?ensemble .
}
```

This query retrieves individuals and their associated ensembles, but it does not include the temporal information required to fully answer the competency question.
