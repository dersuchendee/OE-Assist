**Yes**

The competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides information about ensemble memberships, actors, and the time period of their membership. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?actor ?actorLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble ;
            :hasEnsembleMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :memberActor ?actor ;
              :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?ensemble ?startDate
```

This query retrieves the ensemble, actor, and the time period of their membership, which answers the competency question.
