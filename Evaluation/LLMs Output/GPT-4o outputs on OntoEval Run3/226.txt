**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to ensembles, actors, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific ensemble and its members at a specific time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?actor ?actorName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble ;
            :hasEnsembleMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :hasMember ?actor ;
              :hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
}
```
