The competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for ensemble memberships, actors, and time periods. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?actor ?actorName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership ;
              :hasEnsemble ?ensemble ;
              :hasMember ?actor ;
              :hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
}
```
