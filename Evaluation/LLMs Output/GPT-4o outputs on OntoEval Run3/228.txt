**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to associate ensemble members with a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and actors, but it lacks a mechanism to capture the temporal aspect of ensemble membership at a specific point in time.

However, we can extract partial information about ensemble members and their roles:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?actor ?actorName
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership .
  ?membership :actorName ?actorName .
}
```
