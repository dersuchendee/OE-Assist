**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct classes or properties related to ensembles or their members. The closest related class is `Cl_EnsembleMembership`, but it does not provide a direct way to query for members of an ensemble at a specific point in time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
}
```
