**Yes**

The competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for members of an ensemble and their roles at specific times.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?role ?roleName ?date
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?member .
  
  ?member :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleInProduction ?production .
  ?role :roleAtTime ?date .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?role :roleName ?roleName . }
}
ORDER BY ?ensemble ?date
```

This query retrieves the members of ensembles, their roles, and the dates associated with those roles, which aligns with the competency question.
