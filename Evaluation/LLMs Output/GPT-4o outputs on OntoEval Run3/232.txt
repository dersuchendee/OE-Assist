**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the members of an ensemble at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to ensembles and memberships, but it lacks a direct connection to a specific point in time for ensemble membership. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership :member ?member .
}
```
