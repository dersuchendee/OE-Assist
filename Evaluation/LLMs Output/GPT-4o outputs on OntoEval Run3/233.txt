**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to ensembles or their members. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to ensembles, but it will not include specific members or time points.

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
}
```
