The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate authors to plays they have written. Specifically, the `:op_writtenBy` object property connects instances of the `:Cl_Play` class to instances of the `:Cl_Author` class. This allows us to query for plays written by a specific author.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :dp_title ?playTitle ;
        :op_writtenBy ?author .
  ?author :dp_authorName "William Shakespeare" .
}
```

This query retrieves the titles of plays written by William Shakespeare, as specified in the ontology.
