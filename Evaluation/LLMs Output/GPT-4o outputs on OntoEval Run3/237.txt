The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `ns1:Author` and the object property `ns1:wrotePlay`, which associates an author with the plays they have written. Therefore, we can construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the plays written by a specific author.

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?authorLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a ns1:Author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorLabel . }
  
  ?author ns1:wrotePlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
```
