The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate authors to plays they have written. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?authorLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a theatre:Author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorLabel . }

  ?author theatre:wrote ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?author ?play
```

This query retrieves authors and the plays they have written, along with optional labels for better readability.
