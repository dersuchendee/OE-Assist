**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct relationships or properties that link authors to the plays they have written. Therefore, the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to plays and writing events, but without the author information.

```sparql
SELECT ?play
WHERE {
  ?writingEvent a :Cl_WritingEvent .
  ?writingEvent :hasPlay ?play .
}
```
