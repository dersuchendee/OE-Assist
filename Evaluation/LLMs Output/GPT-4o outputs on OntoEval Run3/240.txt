The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Play` with a property `:hasAuthor` that relates a play to its author. This allows us to query for plays written by a specific author.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  ?play :hasAuthor ?author .
  ?author rdfs:label "William Shakespeare"@en .  # Replace with the desired author's name
  ?play :hasTitle ?playTitle .
}
```
