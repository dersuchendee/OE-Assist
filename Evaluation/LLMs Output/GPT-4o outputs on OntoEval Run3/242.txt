**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between authors and the plays they have written. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, cities, plays, theatres, actors, ensembles, authors, newspapers, productions, and other related concepts. However, there is no property that directly links an author to the plays they have written.

To extract a partial answer, we can query for plays and their associated authors, but this will not provide a complete answer to the competency question.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?author
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?author a :Cl_Author .
    ?author :hasWritten ?authorship .
    ?authorship :hasWrittenPlay ?play .
  }
}
```
