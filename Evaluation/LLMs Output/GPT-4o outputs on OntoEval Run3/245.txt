**Yes**

The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Author` and the object property `wrotePlay` which links an author to the plays they have written. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?authorName ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author ;
          :hasName ?authorName ;
          :wrotePlay ?play .
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :hasTitle ?playTitle .
}
```

This query retrieves the names of authors and the titles of the plays they have written, which directly answers the competency question.
