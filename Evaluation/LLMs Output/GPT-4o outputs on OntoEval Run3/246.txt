The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Author` and the object property `op_hasWritten` which connects an author to the plays they have written. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?authorName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  ?author :op_hasWritten ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playName . }
}
```
