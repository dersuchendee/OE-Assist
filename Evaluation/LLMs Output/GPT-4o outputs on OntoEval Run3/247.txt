The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate authors to the plays they have written. Specifically, the `:wrote` object property connects instances of the `:Cl_Author` class to instances of the `:Cl_Play` class. 

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?authorName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorName . }
  
  ?author :wrote ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playName . }
}
ORDER BY ?author ?play
```

This query retrieves all authors and the plays they have written, along with optional labels for better readability.
