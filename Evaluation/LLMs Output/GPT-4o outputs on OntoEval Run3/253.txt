**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct connection between an author and the plays they have written. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, and other related concepts, but it does not explicitly model the relationship between an author and their written plays. Therefore, the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying plays and their titles, but without linking them to a specific author:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :playTitle ?playTitle .
}
```
