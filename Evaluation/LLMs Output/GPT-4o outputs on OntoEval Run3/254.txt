**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about authors or their relationship to plays. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" using the given ontology. However, we can extract information about plays and productions, which might be partially useful.

```sparql
SELECT ?play
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
}
```
