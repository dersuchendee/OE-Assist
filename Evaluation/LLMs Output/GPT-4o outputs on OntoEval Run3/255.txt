The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Author` and the object property `wrotePlay` which connects an author to a play. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the plays written by a specific author.

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?authorName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorName . }
  
  ?author :wrotePlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playName . }
}
```
