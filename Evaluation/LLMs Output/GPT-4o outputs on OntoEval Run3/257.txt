**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology as it contains the necessary classes and properties to determine the writing period of a play. The SPARQL query to extract the answer is as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :op_hasWritingPeriod ?writingPeriod .
  ?writingPeriod :dp_startYear ?startYear .
  ?writingPeriod :dp_endYear ?endYear .
}
```
