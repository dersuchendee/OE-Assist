The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate to plays and their writing periods, specifically through the `Cl_Play` and `Cl_WritingPeriod` classes, and the `op_hasWritingPeriod`, `dp_startYear`, and `dp_endYear` properties.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the writing period of a specific play:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?title ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :dp_title ?title ;
        :op_hasWritingPeriod ?writingPeriod .
  ?writingPeriod :dp_startYear ?startYear ;
                 :dp_endYear ?endYear .
}
```

This query retrieves the title of the play along with its writing period, defined by the start and end years.
