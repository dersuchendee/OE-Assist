**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct relationships or properties that link a product to its manufacturer. Therefore, the competency question "Who is the manufacturer of a certain product?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to actors and their roles, which might indirectly relate to manufacturing.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role
WHERE {
  ?actor rdf:type :ActorCVNRole .
  ?actor rdf:type ?role .
  FILTER(?role = :manufacturer)
}
```

This query attempts to find actors with the role of a manufacturer, but it does not directly link them to specific products.
