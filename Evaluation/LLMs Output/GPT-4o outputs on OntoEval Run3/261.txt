The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes information about plays, their authors, and the time periods during which they were written. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?play a theatre:Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  ?play theatre:hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod theatre:hasStartDate ?startDate .
  ?timePeriod theatre:hasEndDate ?endDate .
}
```
