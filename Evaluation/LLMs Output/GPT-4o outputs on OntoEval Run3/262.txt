The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to writing events, plays, and time periods, which are necessary to extract the required information.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?writingEvent a :Cl_WritingEvent .
  ?writingEvent :hasPlay ?play .
  ?writingEvent :hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :startYear ?startYear .
  ?timePeriod :endYear ?endYear .
}
```
