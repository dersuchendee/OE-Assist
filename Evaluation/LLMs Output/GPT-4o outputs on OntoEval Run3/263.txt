**Yes**

The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `:Play` and the object property `:wasWrittenDuring` which relates a play to a `:TimeInterval`. The `:TimeInterval` class has properties `:hasStartDate` and `:hasEndDate` which can be used to determine the time period during which a play was written.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?title ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  ?play :hasTitle ?title .
  ?play :wasWrittenDuring ?timeInterval .
  ?timeInterval :hasStartDate ?startYear .
  ?timeInterval :hasEndDate ?endYear .
}
```
