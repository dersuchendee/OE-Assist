The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to plays and their time periods, specifically the `Cl_PlayTimePeriod` class and the `startYear` and `endYear` properties. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :hasPlayTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :startYear ?startYear .
  ?timePeriod :endYear ?endYear .
}
```
