**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the time period during which a play was written. The closest property available is `:hasWritingPeriod`, which is a datatype property associated with `:Cl_Play`. However, the ontology does not specify how this property is populated or used to determine the writing period of a play.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?play ?writingPeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasWritingPeriod ?writingPeriod . }
}
```
