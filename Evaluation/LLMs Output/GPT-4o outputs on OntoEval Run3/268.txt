The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:writtenDuring` data property, which specifies the time period during which a play was written. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?title ?writtenDuring

  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :hasTitle ?title ;
        :writtenDuring ?writtenDuring .
}
```
