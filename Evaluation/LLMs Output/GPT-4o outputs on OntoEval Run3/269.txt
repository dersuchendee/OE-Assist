**Yes**

The competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:dp_writtenStartDate` and `:dp_writtenEndDate` data properties for the `:Cl_Play` class, which allows us to query the time period during which a play was written.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?writtenStartDate ?writtenEndDate
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :dp_writtenStartDate ?writtenStartDate .
  ?play :dp_writtenEndDate ?writtenEndDate .
}
```
