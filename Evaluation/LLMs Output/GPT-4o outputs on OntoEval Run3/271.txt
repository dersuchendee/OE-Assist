**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the time period during which a play was written. It only includes information about the writing period of "The Merchant of Venice" but not for other plays. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted for "The Merchant of Venice."

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?writingStartDate ?writingEndDate
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :hasWritingPeriod ?writingPeriod .
  ?writingPeriod :writingStartDate ?writingStartDate .
  ?writingPeriod :writingEndDate ?writingEndDate .
}
```
