**No**

The ontology does not provide explicit information about the time period during which a play was written. However, it does include a property `:writtenDuring` that links a play to a time period. We can extract this partial information using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?timePeriodResource .
  ?timePeriodResource :timePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
```
