**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the time period during which a play was written. The ontology includes information about plays, authors, and time periods related to festivals and productions, but it does not explicitly link a play to the time period it was written. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the available time periods related to plays:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?play rdf:type :Cl_Play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?playTimePeriod rdf:type :Cl_PlayTimePeriod ;
                    :hasPlay ?play ;
                    :hasTimePeriod ?date .
    ?date :festivalDate ?startDate, ?endDate .
  }
}
```
