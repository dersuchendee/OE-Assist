**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the time period during which a play was written. The ontology includes a class `Cl_PlayCreation` with a property `creationPeriod`, but there is no direct connection between a specific play and its creation period in the provided ontology. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the `creationPeriod` for any play, but it won't be specific to a certain play.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?creationPeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :wasWrittenDuring ?creation .
  ?creation :creationPeriod ?creationPeriod .
}
```
