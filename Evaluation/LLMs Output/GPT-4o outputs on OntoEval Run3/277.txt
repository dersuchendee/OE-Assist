**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the time period during which a play was written. The ontology includes a class `Cl_TimePeriod` and a property `writtenDuring` that connects a `Cl_Play` to a `Cl_TimePeriod`, but there is no data property or mechanism to specify the actual time period values for plays.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information about plays and their associated time periods:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?play :writtenDuring ?timePeriod .
  }
}
```
