**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the number of acts a particular play contains. The ontology includes classes and properties related to plays, productions, and other theatre-related concepts, but it lacks a specific property or class that directly associates a play with its number of acts.

However, we can extract partial information about plays and their titles, which might be useful for further investigation or manual lookup.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?title
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :dp_title ?title .
}
```
