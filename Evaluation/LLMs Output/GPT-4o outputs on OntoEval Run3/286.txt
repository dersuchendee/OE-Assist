The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `:Play` and the object property `:hasAct`, which relates a play to its acts. We can count the number of acts associated with a play to answer the question.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?play (COUNT(?act) AS ?numberOfActs)
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  ?play :hasAct ?act .
}
GROUP BY ?play
```
