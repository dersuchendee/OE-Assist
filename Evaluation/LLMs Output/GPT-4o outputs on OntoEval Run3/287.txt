**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about the number of acts in a play. The ontology includes classes and properties related to plays, theatre productions, festivals, and other related concepts, but it does not specify the number of acts a play contains. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial query can be constructed to retrieve plays, but it will not provide the number of acts.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
}
```
