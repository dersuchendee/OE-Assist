The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:containsActs` datatype property, which is associated with the `:Cl_Play` class. This property can be used to retrieve the number of acts for a specific play.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the number of acts for a particular play:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?numActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :containsActs ?numActs .
}
```
