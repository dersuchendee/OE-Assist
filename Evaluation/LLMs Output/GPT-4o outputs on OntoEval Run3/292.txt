The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:dp_numberOfActs` data property, which is associated with the `:Cl_Play` class. This allows us to query the number of acts for a specific play.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the number of acts for a particular play:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :dp_numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```

This query retrieves the number of acts for each play in the ontology. You can specify a particular play by adding a filter or directly querying for a specific play URI.
