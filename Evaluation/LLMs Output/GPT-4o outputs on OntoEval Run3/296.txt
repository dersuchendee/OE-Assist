The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_PlayActs` which is associated with a play and has a property `hasNumberOfActs` that specifies the number of acts. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the number of acts for a particular play:

```sparql
SELECT ?playName ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?playAct a :Cl_PlayActs ;
           :hasPlay ?play ;
           :hasNumberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
```
