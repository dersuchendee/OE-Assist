**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to trace who viewed a product. However, we can extract partial information about the roles related to resources, including viewing, but not specifically tied to a product.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?resource
WHERE {
  ?relation a actor:ViewingResource .
  ?relation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  ?relation actorODP:participatingResource ?resource .
}
```
