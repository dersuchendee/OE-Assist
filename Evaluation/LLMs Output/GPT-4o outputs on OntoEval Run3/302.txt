**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about the number of acts in a play. The ontology primarily focuses on theatre festivals, locations, productions, and roles, but it does not include details about the structure of plays, such as the number of acts. Therefore, the competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying plays within the ontology, but without the number of acts:

```sparql
SELECT ?play
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
}
```
