**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the premiere date of a specific theatre production. The ontology includes a `TheatreProduction` class with a `hasPremiere` object property that relates a production to a `Premiere` event, but it does not include a datatype property for the premiere date itself. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premiere
WHERE {
  ?production a :TheatreProduction .
  ?production :hasPremiere ?premiere .
}
```
