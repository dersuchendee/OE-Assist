**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any explicit properties or classes that directly relate to the action of viewing a product or the actors involved in such an action. The ontology includes classes and properties related to roles and resource relations, but there is no specific mention of a "viewing" action or a connection between actors and products in the context of viewing.

However, we can attempt to extract a partial answer by querying for any instances of the `ViewingResource` class, which might imply a viewing action, but this does not directly answer the competency question as it lacks the connection to specific products.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?resource
WHERE {
  ?viewingResource a :ViewingResource .
  ?viewingResource actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  ?viewingResource actorODP:participatingResource ?resource .
}
```

This query attempts to find any actors and resources involved in a `ViewingResource` relation, but without explicit data or properties connecting these to specific products, it remains a partial answer.
