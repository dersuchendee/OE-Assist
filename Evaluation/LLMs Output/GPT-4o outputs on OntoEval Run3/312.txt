**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to associate a specific production with its premier date. The ontology includes classes and properties related to productions, plays, and dates, but it does not explicitly connect a production to its premier date in a way that can be queried directly. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production :premierDate ?premierDate . }
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve productions and their premier dates, but without a direct connection in the ontology, it may not return the desired results.
