**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific production with its premier date. The class `Cl_ProductionPremier` and the property `hasPremierDate` exist, but there is no direct connection between a specific production and its premier date in the ontology. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_ProductionPremier .
  OPTIONAL { ?production :hasPremierDate ?premierDate . }
}
```
