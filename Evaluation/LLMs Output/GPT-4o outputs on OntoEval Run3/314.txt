The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:premierDate` property associated with the `:Cl_Production` class, which allows us to query for the premier date of a production.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the premier date of a specific production:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?title ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :isBasedOn ?play .
  ?play :hasTitle ?title .
  ?production :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the production, its title, and the premier date for each production in the ontology. You can filter the results by a specific title if needed.
