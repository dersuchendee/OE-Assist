The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to productions and their premier events, specifically the `Cl_Production` class, the `Cl_PremierEvent` class, and the `premierDate` data property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the premier date of a specific production:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premierEvent .
  ?premierEvent a :Cl_PremierEvent .
  ?premierEvent :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the premier date for each production in the ontology. You can specify a particular production by adding a filter or a specific URI in the query.
