**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about the premier dates of productions. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, locations, plays, productions, and other related entities, but it does not explicitly model the premier dates of specific productions.

However, we can extract partial information related to productions and their associated plays, but not the specific premier dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :basedOnPlay ?play .
}
```
