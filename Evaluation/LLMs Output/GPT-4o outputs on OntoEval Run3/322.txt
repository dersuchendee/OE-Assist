The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to productions and their premier dates, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the premier date of a specific production.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
