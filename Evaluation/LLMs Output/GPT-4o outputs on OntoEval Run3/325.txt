The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_ProductionPremier` which is a subclass of `Cl_Production` and `Cl_Date`, and it has the object property `hasPremier` and the data property `premierDate`. This allows us to query for the premier date of a production.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
