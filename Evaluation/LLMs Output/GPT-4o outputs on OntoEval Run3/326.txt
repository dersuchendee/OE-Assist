The competency question is supported by the ontology. We can write a SPARQL query to extract the star rating given by a certain newspaper for a certain production.

```sparql
SELECT ?newspaper ?production ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?reviewRating a :Cl_ReviewRating ;
                :reviews ?newspaper ;
                :concerns ?production ;
                :hasStarRating ?starRating .
}
