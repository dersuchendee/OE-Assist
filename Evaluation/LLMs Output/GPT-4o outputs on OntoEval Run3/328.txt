**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the "star rating" given by a certain newspaper for a certain production. However, we can extract partial information about reviews and productions.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?newspaper ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_ReviewRating .
  ?review :concerns ?production .
  ?review :reviews ?newspaper .
  ?review :hasStarRating ?starRating .
}
```
