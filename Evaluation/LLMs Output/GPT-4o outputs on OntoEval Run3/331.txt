**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes related to newspapers or star ratings for productions. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying productions and their reviews, but without the specific star rating or the newspaper that provided it.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?review
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :isReviewedIn ?review .
}
```
