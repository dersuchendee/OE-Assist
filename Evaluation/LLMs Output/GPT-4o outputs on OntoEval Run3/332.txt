**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes related to reviews or star ratings given by newspapers for theatre productions. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying theatre productions and their associated plays.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :TheatreProduction .
  ?production :productionOf ?play .
}
```
