The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a "star rating" with a specific newspaper for a specific production. The ontology includes classes and properties related to productions, reviews, and newspapers, but it lacks a direct connection between a newspaper and the star rating it gives to a production. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?review ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :hasStarRating ?starRating .
}
```

This query retrieves productions and their associated star ratings, but it does not specify which newspaper provided the rating.
