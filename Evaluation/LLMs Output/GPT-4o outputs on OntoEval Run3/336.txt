**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes that directly relate to a "star rating" given by a newspaper for a production. While there is a class `Cl_NewspaperReview` and a property `hasStarRating`, there is no direct connection between a specific newspaper and a specific production in the ontology. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?newspaperReview ?starRating ?production
WHERE {
  ?newspaperReview a :Cl_NewspaperReview .
  ?newspaperReview :hasStarRating ?starRating .
  ?newspaperReview :reviewsProduction ?production .
}
```

This query retrieves the star ratings and the productions they are associated with, but it does not specify which newspaper gave the rating, as that information is not present in the ontology.
