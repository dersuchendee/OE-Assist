The ontology does not contain any information about newspaper reviews or star ratings for theatre productions. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the theatre productions and their associated plays.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_TheatreProduction .
  ?production :op_isBasedOnPlay ?play .
}
