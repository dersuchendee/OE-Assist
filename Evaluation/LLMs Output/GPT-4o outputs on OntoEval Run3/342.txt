The ontology does not contain any information about the star ratings given by newspapers for specific productions. However, we can extract partial information about the productions and the newspapers involved.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?productionName ?newspaper ?newspaperName
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_Review .
  ?review :hasProduction ?production .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
  ?review :hasNewspaper ?newspaper .
  ?newspaper :newspaperName ?newspaperName .
}
