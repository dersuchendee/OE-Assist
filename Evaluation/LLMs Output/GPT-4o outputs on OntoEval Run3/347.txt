The competency question "What is the “star rating” given by a certain newspaper for a certain production?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate productions, reviews, and newspapers, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the star rating for a specific production reviewed by a specific newspaper.

Here is the SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?newspaper ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :reviews ?review .
  ?review a :Cl_ProductionReview .
  ?review :reviewedBy ?newspaper .
  ?review :starRating ?starRating .
}
```
