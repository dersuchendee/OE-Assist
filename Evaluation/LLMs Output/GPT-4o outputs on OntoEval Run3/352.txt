**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate an actor with the specific time they started working for a specific theatre. The ontology includes information about employment contracts and roles, but it does not explicitly link an actor's start time with a specific theatre. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a ns1:Actor .
  ?actor ns1:employedAt ?theatre .
  ?actor ns1:hasEmploymentContract ?contract .
  ?contract ns1:employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the employment start date for actors and the theatres they are employed at, but it does not specify the exact time an actor started working for a specific theatre.
