The competency question "At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `Employment` class, which relates an `Actor` to a `Theatre` with a `hasStartDate` property indicating the start date of the employment. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Employment .
  ?employment :hasEmployee ?actor .
  ?employment :hasEmployer ?theatre .
  ?employment :hasStartDate ?startDate .
}
```
