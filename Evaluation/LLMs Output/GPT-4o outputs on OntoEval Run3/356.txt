**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct properties or classes that relate to the employment start date of an actor at a specific theatre. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre productions, festivals, plays, and roles, but it lacks the necessary structure to directly answer the competency question regarding the employment start date of an actor at a theatre.

However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying actors and their associated theatres, but without the specific start date information.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?theatre
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :hasActor ?actor .
  ?employment :hasTheatre ?theatre .
}
```
