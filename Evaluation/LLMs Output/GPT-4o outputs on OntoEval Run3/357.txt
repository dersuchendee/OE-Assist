**Yes**

The competency question "At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, their employment, and theatres. Specifically, the `Cl_ActorEmployment` class and the properties `hasEmployment`, `hasEmploymentDate`, and `isEmployedIn` can be used to determine when an actor started working for a specific theatre.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?employmentDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment .
  ?employment :isEmployedIn ?theatre .
  ?employment :hasEmploymentDate ?employmentDate .
}
```
