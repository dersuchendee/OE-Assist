**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the start date of an actor's employment with a specific theatre. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, theatres, actors, and their roles, but it lacks a direct connection between an actor and their employment start date with a specific theatre.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?employmentDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_ActorEmployment .
  ?actor :worksForTheatre ?theatre .
  ?actor :hasEmploymentDate ?employmentDate .
}
```

This query retrieves actors, the theatres they work for, and their employment dates, but it does not specify the start date of employment for a specific theatre.
