**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between actors and processes. The object property `op_involvedIn` connects `Cl_Actor` to `Cl_WorkProcess`, and `op_outlines` connects `Cl_WorkProcess` to `Cl_Process`. However, there is no direct way to query for actors involved in a specific process without additional information or properties that directly link `Cl_Actor` to `Cl_Process`.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?actor
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :op_involvedIn ?workProcess .
}
```
