**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about the employment of actors at specific theatres, nor does it have any properties or classes that would allow us to infer the start date of an actor's employment at a theatre. The ontology does include classes and properties related to theatre productions, ensembles, and roles, but it lacks the necessary connections to answer the competency question directly.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the available information about individuals and their roles:

```sparql
SELECT ?individual ?name ?role ?assignmentDate
WHERE {
  ?individual a :Cl_Individual ;
              :hasName ?name ;
              :hasRoleAssignment ?roleAssignment .
  ?roleAssignment :roleOf ?role ;
                  :assignmentDate ?assignmentDate .
}
```
