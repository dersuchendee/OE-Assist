**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the start date of an actor's employment at a specific theatre. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre productions, ensembles, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between an actor and the start date of their employment at a specific theatre. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment ;
              :op_employmentOf ?actor ;
              :op_employedAt ?theatre ;
              :dp_startDate ?startDate .
}
```
