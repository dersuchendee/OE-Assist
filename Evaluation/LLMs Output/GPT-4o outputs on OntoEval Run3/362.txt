**Yes**

The competency question "At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, their employment, and the theatres they are employed at, which allows us to extract the start date of an actor's employment at a specific theatre.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :employmentIn ?theatre .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the actor, the theatre they are employed at, and the start date of their employment, which directly answers the competency question.
