**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the start date of an actor's employment with a specific theatre. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, theatres, and dates, but it lacks a direct connection between an actor and their employment start date at a specific theatre. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the actor and the theatre, but not the start date.

```sparql
SELECT ?actorName ?theatreName
WHERE {
  ?employment rdf:type :Cl_ActorEmployment .
  ?employment :hasActor ?actor .
  ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
  ?employment :hasTheatre ?theatre .
  ?theatre :theatreName ?theatreName .
}
```
