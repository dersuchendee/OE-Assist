**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the start date of an actor's employment at a specific theatre. The ontology includes the `:employmentStartDate` property for `:Cl_Person`, but it does not connect this information to a specific theatre through the `:employedAt` property. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
}
```
