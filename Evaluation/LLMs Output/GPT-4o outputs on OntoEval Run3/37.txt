The competency question "What are the actors involved in the process?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines a `Process` class that involves actors through the `involvesActor` property, and actors are defined as instances of the `Actor` class. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the actors involved in each process.

```sparql
SELECT ?process ?actor
WHERE {
  ?process a :Process .
  ?process :involvesActor ?actor .
}
```
