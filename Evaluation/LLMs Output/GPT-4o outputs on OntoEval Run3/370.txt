**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the start date of an actor's employment with a specific theatre. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, ensembles, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between an actor and their employment start date with a specific theatre.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :employedActor ?actor .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
}
```
