**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate roles with specific productions and time points. The ontology includes classes and properties for actors, roles, and productions, but it lacks a mechanism to specify the roles an actor has within a specific production at a specific time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the roles and productions:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel ?role ?roleLabel ?production ?productionLabel
WHERE {
  ?actor a theatre:Actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }

  ?actor theatre:hasRole ?role .
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel . }

  ?actor theatre:participatesIn ?production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
}
```
