**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate members of an ensemble with a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for ensembles, theatre productions, and performances, but it lacks a mechanism to specify the temporal aspect of ensemble membership. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by listing the members of an ensemble without the temporal context.

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?memberName
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?member .
  ?member :hasName ?memberName .
}
```
