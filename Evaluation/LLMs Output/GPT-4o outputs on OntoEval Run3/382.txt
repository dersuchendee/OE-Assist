**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about roles or specific points in time for a person's involvement in a production. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, ensembles, actors, and roles, but it lacks the necessary details to answer the competency question about specific roles a person has within a production at a certain point in time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?production ?role
WHERE {
  ?role a :Cl_ActorRole .
  ?role :playedBy ?person .
  ?role :inProduction ?production .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, production, and role, but it does not include the specific point in time, which is required to fully answer the competency question.
