**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, productions, and roles, but it lacks a mechanism to connect these elements in a way that answers the competency question directly. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?production ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Actor .
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?role a :Cl_ActorRole .
  ?role :hasRole ?production .
}
```

This query attempts to find actors and their roles in productions, but it does not include the temporal aspect required by the competency question.
