**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with specific roles within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for roles and role assignments, but it lacks the necessary connections to specify the roles a person has within a specific production at a specific time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role ?production
WHERE {
  ?roleAssignment :op_roleOf ?actor .
  ?roleAssignment :op_hasRole ?role .
  ?roleAssignment :op_roleInProduction ?production .
}
```
