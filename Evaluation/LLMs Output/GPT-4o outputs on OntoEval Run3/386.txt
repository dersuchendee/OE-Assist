**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, roles, productions, and time, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements to answer the competency question fully. However, we can extract partial information about roles and productions:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?roleName ?production ?time
WHERE {
  ?roleAssignment a :Cl_RoleAssignment ;
                  :roleName ?roleName ;
                  :roleInProduction ?production ;
                  :hasActor ?actor ;
                  :atTime ?time .
}
```
