**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to actors, roles, productions, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection that would allow us to query for a person's roles within a specific production at a specific time.

However, we can extract partial information about actors, their roles, and the productions they are involved in, but not specifically at a certain point in time.

```sparql
SELECT ?actorName ?roleName ?productionName
WHERE {
  ?actorRole rdf:type :Cl_ActorRole ;
             :hasRole ?role ;
             :roleInProduction ?production .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
  ?actorRole :hasRole ?role .
  ?actorRole :roleInProduction ?production .
  ?actorRole :roleTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
}
```
