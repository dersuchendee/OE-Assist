**No**

The ontology provided does not include any information about roles that a person might have within a production. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, actors, and their employment, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and a specific production at a certain point in time.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on actors and their associated productions:

```sparql
SELECT ?actorName ?productionName
WHERE {
  ?actor rdf:type :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
  
  ?ensembleMembership rdf:type :Cl_EnsembleMembership .
  ?ensembleMembership :hasMember ?actor .
  
  ?production rdf:type :Cl_Production .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
  
  ?productionPlay rdf:type :Cl_ProductionPlay .
  ?productionPlay :hasProduction ?production .
}
```

This query retrieves actors and the productions they are associated with, but it does not provide information about specific roles or time periods within those productions.
