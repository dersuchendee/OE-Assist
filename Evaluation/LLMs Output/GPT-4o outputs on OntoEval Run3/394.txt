**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a production at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, plays, productions, ensembles, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and the specific production and time.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the roles assigned within a production:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?roleName ?production
WHERE {
  ?roleAssignment a :Cl_RoleAssignment .
  ?roleAssignment :roleOf ?person .
  ?roleAssignment :roleName ?roleName .
  ?production :assignedRole ?roleAssignment .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, role name, and production, but it does not include the specific point in time, as that information is not available in the ontology.
