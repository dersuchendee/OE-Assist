The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology defines a class `ns1:Premier` with a restriction that enforces a cardinality of 1 on the property `ns1:premierDate`, which indicates that each production can have exactly one premier. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the productions and their corresponding premier dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premier ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a ns1:TheatreProduction .
  ?production ns1:hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier ns1:premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
