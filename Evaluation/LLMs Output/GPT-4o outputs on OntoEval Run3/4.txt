The competency question "Which is the type of a source?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for different types of sources and a property `hasSourceType` that links a source to its type. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?source ?sourceType
WHERE {
  ?source a :Cl_Source .
  ?source :hasSourceType ?sourceType .
}
```
