The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology defines a class `ProductionWithOnePremier` which is a subclass of `Production` and has a restriction that enforces exactly one `Premier`. This aligns with the competency question.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract productions with exactly one premier:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?premier ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a theatre:ProductionWithOnePremier .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
  ?production theatre:hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier theatre:hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
