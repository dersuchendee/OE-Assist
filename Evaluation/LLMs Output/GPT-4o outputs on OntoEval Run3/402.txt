**Yes**

The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology defines a `TheatreProduction` class with a restriction that it has exactly one `Premiere`. This aligns with the competency question, allowing us to write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premiere
WHERE {
  ?production a :TheatreProduction .
  ?production :hasPremiere ?premiere .
}
```
