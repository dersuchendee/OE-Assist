The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_ProductionPremier` and the property `hasPremier`, which connects a `Cl_Production` to a `Cl_ProductionPremier`. This allows us to query for productions and their associated premiers.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premier
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)
```

This query selects productions that have exactly one associated premier.
