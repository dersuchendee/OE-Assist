The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Cl_Production` class that specifies a cardinality of exactly one for the `premierDate` property. This means that each instance of `Cl_Production` must have exactly one `premierDate`, which aligns with the competency question.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract productions with their premier dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
