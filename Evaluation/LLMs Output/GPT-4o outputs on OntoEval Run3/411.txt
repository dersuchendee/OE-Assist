The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Cl_Production` class that enforces a qualified cardinality of 1 on the `hasPremier` property, which means each production must have exactly one premier. Here is a SPARQL query to extract productions and their premiers:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?productionName ?premier ?premierDateValue
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDateInstance .
  ?premierDateInstance :premierDateValue ?premierDateValue .
}
```
