The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Production` with a restriction that it has exactly one `Cl_ProductionPremier`. This allows us to query for productions and their associated premier dates.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?productionName ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
}
```
