**Yes**

The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `:hasPremier` property, specifying that a `:Cl_Production` must have exactly one `:Cl_Date` as its premier. This allows us to write a SPARQL query to verify this condition.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :dateValue ?premierDate .
}
```
