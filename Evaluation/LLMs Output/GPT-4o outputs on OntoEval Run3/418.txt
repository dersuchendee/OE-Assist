**Yes**

The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_ProductionPremier` which is a subclass of both `Cl_Production` and `Cl_Date`, and the object property `hasPremier` which connects a `Cl_Production` to a `Cl_ProductionPremier`. This allows us to query for productions and their associated premier dates.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)
```

This query selects productions that have exactly one premier date associated with them.
