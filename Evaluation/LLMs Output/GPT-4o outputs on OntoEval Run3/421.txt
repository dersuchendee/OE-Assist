**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query which instruments a person plays. The ontology includes classes and properties related to musical groups, albums, tracks, and performances, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the instruments they play. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the members of a musical group:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?name
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasName ?name .
}
```
