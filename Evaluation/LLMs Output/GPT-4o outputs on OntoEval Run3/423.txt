**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a musician with the instruments they play. The ontology defines a `plays` property that connects a `Musician` to an `Instrument`, but it does not specify which instruments a specific musician plays. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

However, we can extract a partial answer by listing all musicians and the instruments they play, without specifying which musician plays which instrument.

```sparql
SELECT ?musician ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?musician a :Musician .
  ?musician :plays ?instrument .
}
```
