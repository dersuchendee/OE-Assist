**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with the instruments they play. The ontology includes classes and properties related to musicians, bands, and performances, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the instruments they play. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on musicians and their roles:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
}
```
