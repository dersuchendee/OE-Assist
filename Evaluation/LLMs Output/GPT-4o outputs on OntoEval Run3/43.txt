The competency question "What is the type of this actor?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:hasActorType` property that associates an `:Actor` with its `:ActorType`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the type of a given actor.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorType
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Actor .
  ?actor :hasActorType ?actorType .
}
```
