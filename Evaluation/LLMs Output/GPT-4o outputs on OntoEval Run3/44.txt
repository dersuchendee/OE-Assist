**No**

The ontology provided does not explicitly define a relationship between actors and competencies. While there are classes and properties related to actors, roles, and capabilities, there is no direct link or property that associates an actor with a specific competency. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the current ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract actors and their roles:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role
WHERE {
  ?participation a actorODP:Participation .
  ?participation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  ?participation actorODP:participantRole ?role .
}
```
