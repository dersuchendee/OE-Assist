**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the members of a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to bands, musicians, and their memberships, but it lacks temporal information about when a person was a member of a band. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only provide partial information about band members without considering the time aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?member
WHERE {
  ?band a :Cl_Band .
  ?band :hasMember ?member .
}
```
