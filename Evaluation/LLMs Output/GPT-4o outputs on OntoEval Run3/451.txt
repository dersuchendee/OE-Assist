**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a band with its members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to band membership and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between a band, its members, and a specific time period. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying band members without considering the time aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?person
WHERE {
  ?bandMembership a :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?bandMembership :bandMember ?band .
  ?bandMembership :memberOfBand ?person .
}
```
