**No**

The competency question asks for the members of a certain band at a certain point in time. The ontology provided does not include temporal information about band membership, such as start and end dates for each member's participation in the band. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the competency question fully with the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about the members of a band without considering the temporal aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?person
WHERE {
  ?person :memberOf :RedHotChiliPeppers .
}
