**No**

The competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" is not fully supported by the ontology. The ontology provides information about band memberships and their associated times, but it does not directly link these memberships to specific points in time for querying purposes. A partial answer can be extracted by querying the band memberships and their associated times, but it won't directly answer the question about members at a specific point in time.

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?member ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?membership :hasMember ?member .
  ?membership :memberOf ?band .
  ?membership :membershipTime ?membershipTime .
}
```
