**No**

The ontology does not directly support querying which actors hold a specific competency. The ontology defines relationships between actors, competencies, and work, but it does not provide a direct link from competencies to actors. A partial answer can be obtained by querying actors and their competencies through the `actorHasCompetency` and `competencyOfActor` properties.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?competency
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :actorHasCompetency ?actorCompetency .
  ?actorCompetency :competencyOfActor ?competency .
}
```
