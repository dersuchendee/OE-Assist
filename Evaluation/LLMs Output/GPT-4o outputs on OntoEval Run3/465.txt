**No**

The competency question asks for the members of a certain band at a certain point in time. The ontology provided does not have a direct way to query for band members at a specific time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to band membership and time periods, but it lacks the necessary connections to directly answer the question about band members at a specific time.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists band members without considering the time aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?member
WHERE {
  ?band a :Cl_Band .
  ?band :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?membership :isMemberOfBand ?member .
}
```
