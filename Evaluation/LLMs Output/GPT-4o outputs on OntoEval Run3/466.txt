**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a role in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes for Person, Band, Role, and BandMembership, but it lacks a direct connection between these classes that would allow for querying the role of a person in a band at a specific time. The BandMembership class is a subclass of Person, Band, and Role, but it does not have properties that connect these entities in a way that would allow for the desired query.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?membership :membershipOfPerson ?person .
  ?membership :membershipInBand ?band .
  ?membership :playsRole ?role .
}
```
