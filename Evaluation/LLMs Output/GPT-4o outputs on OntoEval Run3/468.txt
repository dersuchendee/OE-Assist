**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to represent the role of a person in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for bands, musicians, albums, tracks, and performances, but it lacks a mechanism to capture the temporal aspect of a person's role within a band. The ontology would need a reification or a specific class to represent the membership of a person in a band with associated roles and time periods.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the members of a band:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role
WHERE {
  ?band a :Cl_Band .
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?band .
  OPTIONAL { ?person :hasRole ?role . }
}
```
