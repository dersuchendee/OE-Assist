The competency question "What actors hold this competency?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines a relationship between actors and competencies through the `:hasCompetency` property. We can write a SPARQL query to extract the actors and their competencies.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel ?competency ?competencyLabel
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Actor .
  ?actor :hasCompetency ?competency .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?competency rdfs:label ?competencyLabel . }
}
```
