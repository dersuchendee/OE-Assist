**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a musician with a specific role in a band at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for musicians, bands, line-ups, and time periods, but it lacks a mechanism to specify the role of a musician within a band during a specific time period. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?musician ?band ?lineUp ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?lineUp a :LineUp ;
          :hasMember ?musician ;
          :partOfBand ?band ;
          :activeDuring ?timePeriod .
}
```
