**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to people, bands, roles, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements to answer the competency question fully. However, we can extract partial information about band memberships and roles.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?membership :hasPerson ?person .
  ?membership :hasBand ?band .
  ?membership :hasRole ?role .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membership_startDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membership_endDate ?endDate . }
}
```
