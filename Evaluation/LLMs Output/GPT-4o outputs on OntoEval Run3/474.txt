**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for persons, bands, roles, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements to answer the competency question. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?band a :Cl_Band .
  ?role a :Cl_Role .
  ?person :hasRoleInBand ?bandRole .
  ?bandRole :roleInBand ?role .
  ?bandRole :bandMember ?band .
}
```
