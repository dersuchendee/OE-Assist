**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes that directly relate to a person's role in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to band membership, roles, and time periods, but it does not explicitly connect these elements in a way that would allow us to query for a person's role in a band at a specific time.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list the roles associated with persons and bands, but without the time component:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role
WHERE {
  ?bandRole a :Cl_BandRole .
  ?bandRole :hasRole ?person .
  ?bandRole :roleOf ?band .
}
```
