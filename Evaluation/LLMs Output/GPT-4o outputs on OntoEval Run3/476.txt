The competency question "What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate a person to a band, a role, and a time period, which are all necessary to answer the CQ.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?bandRole a :Cl_BandRole .
  ?bandRole :hasRoleInBand ?person .
  ?bandRole :hasMemberWithRole ?band .
  ?bandRole :hasRole ?role .
  ?bandRole :duringTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
```
