**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the specific roles of individuals in a band at a certain point in time. While it includes classes and properties related to people, bands, roles, and membership, it lacks the temporal aspect needed to answer the competency question fully. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the roles and memberships without the temporal component:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?band
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleInBand ?band .
}
```
