**Yes**

The competency question "What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate persons to bands and their roles within those bands, along with time annotations. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?time
WHERE {
  ?bandRole rdf:type :Cl_BandRole .
  ?bandRole :roleOfPerson ?person .
  ?bandRole :roleInBand ?band .
  ?bandRole :hasRole ?role .
  ?bandRole :roleAtTime ?time .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, band, role, and time for each band role instance, which directly answers the competency question.
