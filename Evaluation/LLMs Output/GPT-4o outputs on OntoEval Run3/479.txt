**No**

The competency question asks for the role a certain person has in a certain band at a certain point in time. The ontology provided does not include temporal information about roles within bands, only membership start dates. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the CQ fully. However, we can extract partial information about the roles of individuals in bands without the temporal aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?band
WHERE {
  ?bandMembership :hasRole ?role .
  ?bandMembership :bandMembership ?person .
  ?bandMembership :memberOf ?band .
}
```
