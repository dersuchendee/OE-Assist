**No**

The ontology does not explicitly define a class or property that directly represents the actors involved in a Circular Value Network (CVN). However, it does define a class `actor:CVNParticipation` which represents the participation of an actor in a CVN with a certain role. We can extract partial information about actors involved in a CVN by querying for instances of `actor:CVNParticipation` and their associated actors.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?role
WHERE {
  ?participation a actor:CVNParticipation .
  ?participation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  ?participation actorODP:participantRole ?role .
}
```
