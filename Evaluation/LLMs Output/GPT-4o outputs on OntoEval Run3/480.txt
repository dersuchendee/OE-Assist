**No**

The competency question asks for the role of a certain person in a certain band at a certain point in time. The ontology provides information about band membership and roles, but it does not explicitly connect a person's role to a specific point in time. The ontology includes `Cl_BandRole` and `roleTime`, but it does not provide a direct way to query for a person's role at a specific time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?band ?roleTime
WHERE {
  ?bandRole a :Cl_BandRole ;
            :roleOf ?person ;
            :hasRole ?role ;
            :roleInBand ?band ;
            :roleTime ?roleTime .
}
```
