**Yes**

The competency question "What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for a person's role in a band at a specific time.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?time
WHERE {
  ?personRole rdf:type :Cl_PersonRole ;
              :roleOf ?person ;
              :roleInBand ?band ;
              :hasRole ?role ;
              :roleTime ?time .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, band, role, and time from the ontology, which directly answers the competency question.
