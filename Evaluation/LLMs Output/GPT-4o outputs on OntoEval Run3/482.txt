**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for persons, roles, bands, and time periods, but it lacks a reified relationship that connects all these elements together in a single entity. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?band
WHERE {
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  ?person :memberOf ?band .
  ?person :hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?role :hasInstrument ?instrument .
}
```
