**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for persons, bands, memberships, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and the time period of their membership in a band. The closest we can get is to retrieve the membership information, but it does not specify the role at a specific time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract membership information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipIn ?band .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipStart ?membershipStart . }
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd . }
}
```
