**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role in a band at a certain point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties for persons, bands, memberships, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and the time period of that role within a band. The ontology does not have a property that directly links a membership to a specific role at a specific time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?start ?end
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipInBand ?band .
  ?membership :hasRole ?role .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipStart ?start . }
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?end . }
}
```

This query retrieves the person, band, role, and optional start and end dates of the membership, but it does not directly answer the competency question regarding the role at a specific point in time.
