**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any properties or classes that directly relate to a person's role in a band at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to band membership, roles, and time periods, but it does not explicitly connect these elements in a way that would allow us to query for a person's role in a band at a specific time.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on band membership and roles:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?bandMembership a :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?bandMembership :hasMember ?person .
  ?bandMembership :memberOfDuring ?timePeriod .
  
  OPTIONAL {
    ?bandRole a :Cl_BandRole .
    ?bandRole :hasRoleInBand ?person .
    ?bandRole :playsRole ?role .
    ?bandRole :roleDuring ?timePeriod .
  }
}
```

This query attempts to retrieve information about band membership and roles, but it does not fully answer the competency question as it lacks the explicit connection between a person's role in a band and a specific point in time.
