The competency question "What are the actors involved in this circular value network?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate actors to circular value networks, specifically through the `op_hasActor` and `op_involvedIn` properties. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?network ?actor
WHERE {
  ?network a :Cl_CircularValueNetwork .
  ?network :op_hasActor ?actor .
}
```
