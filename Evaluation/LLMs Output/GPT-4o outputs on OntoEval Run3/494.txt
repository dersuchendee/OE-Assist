**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the time period during which an album was recorded. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums, tracks, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between an album and the specific time period of its recording. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?album :wasRecordedDuring ?timePeriod .
  }
}
```
