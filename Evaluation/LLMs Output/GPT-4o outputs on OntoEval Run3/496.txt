**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the time period during which an album was recorded. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums, tracks, and musicians, but it lacks specific properties or classes that capture the recording period of an album. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying albums and their associated tracks, but the recording period cannot be determined.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
```
