The competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to determine the recording period of an album. Specifically, the `:recordedDuring` property links an album to an `:AlbumRecording`, which has `:recordingStart` and `:recordingEnd` properties indicating the time period.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the recording period of an album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :recordedDuring ?recording .
  ?recording :recordingStart ?recordingStart .
  ?recording :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
}
```
