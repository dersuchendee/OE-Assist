The competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_RecordingPeriod` with properties `recordingStart` and `recordingEnd`, which are associated with the `Cl_Album` class through the `recordedAlbum` property. This allows us to query the start and end dates of the recording period for a specific album.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the recording period for a specific album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?recordingPeriod a :Cl_RecordingPeriod ;
                   :recordedAlbum ?album ;
                   :recordingStart ?recordingStart ;
                   :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
}
```
