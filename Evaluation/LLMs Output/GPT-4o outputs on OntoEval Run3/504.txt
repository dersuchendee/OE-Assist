**No**

The competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" is not fully supported by the ontology. The ontology provides information about recording periods and albums, but it does not directly link a specific album to its recording period. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the recording periods and their associated albums, but it won't directly answer the CQ without additional information.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?recordingPeriod a :Cl_RecordingPeriod .
  ?recordingPeriod :recordedAlbum ?album .
  ?recordingPeriod :recordingStart ?recordingStart .
  ?recordingPeriod :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
}
```
