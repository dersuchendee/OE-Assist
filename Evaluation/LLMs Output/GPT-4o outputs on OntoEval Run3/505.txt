**No**

The ontology does not provide explicit information about the time period during which an album was recorded. The ontology includes a `recordedDuring` property for `Cl_AlbumRecording`, but it does not specify a time period or range. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?recording ?recordedDuring
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasRecording ?recording .
  ?recording :recordedDuring ?recordedDuring .
}
```
