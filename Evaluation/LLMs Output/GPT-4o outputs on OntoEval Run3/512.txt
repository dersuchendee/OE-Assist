**No**

The ontology does not directly provide a way to count the number of tracks in an album. The `:hasTrackCount` property is associated with `:Cl_AlbumTrackInfo`, but there is no direct connection between `:Cl_MusicAlbum` and `:Cl_AlbumTrackInfo` in the ontology. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumName ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
  ?album :hasName ?albumName .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
```
