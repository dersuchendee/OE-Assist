The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_AlbumTrackInfo` with a data property `hasTrackCount` that specifies the number of tracks in an album. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumName ?trackCount
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
  ?album :hasName ?albumName .
  ?album :hasTrackCount ?trackInfo .
  ?trackInfo :hasTrackCount ?trackCount .
}
```
