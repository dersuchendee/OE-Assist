The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums and tracks, specifically the `:Cl_Album` and `:Cl_Track` classes, and the `:hasTrack` object property which connects albums to tracks. The `:trackCount` data property is also defined for albums, which can be used to directly retrieve the number of tracks in an album.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the number of tracks for a particular album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?trackCount
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :trackCount ?trackCount .
}
```

This query retrieves the album and its associated track count, which directly answers the competency question.
