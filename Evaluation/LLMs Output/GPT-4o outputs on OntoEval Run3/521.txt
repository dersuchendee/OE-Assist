**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct properties or classes that relate to albums or tracks. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to tracks, but it will not be specific to albums.

```sparql
SELECT ?track
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
}
```

This query will return all instances of tracks, but without any association to albums, as the ontology does not provide such a relationship.
