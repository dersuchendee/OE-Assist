**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the number of tracks in a particular album. While there is a `:numberOfTracks` data property associated with `:Cl_Album`, the ontology does not explicitly link this property to specific tracks within an album. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the `:numberOfTracks` property for a given album.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?numberOfTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :numberOfTracks ?numberOfTracks .
}
```
