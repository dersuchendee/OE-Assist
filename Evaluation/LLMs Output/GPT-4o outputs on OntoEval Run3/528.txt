The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:trackCount` data property, which is associated with the `:Cl_Album` class. This property can be used to retrieve the number of tracks for a specific album.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?trackCount
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :trackCount ?trackCount .
}
```

This query will return the number of tracks for each album in the ontology.
