The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for `Cl_Album` and `Cl_Track`, and an object property `hasTrack` that relates an album to its tracks. We can use a SPARQL query to count the number of tracks associated with a specific album.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album
```

This query will return the number of tracks for each album in the dataset.
