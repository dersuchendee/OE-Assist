**Yes**

The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:Cl_Album` class and the `:containsTrack` object property, which allows us to determine the number of tracks in an album.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numberOfTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album
```
