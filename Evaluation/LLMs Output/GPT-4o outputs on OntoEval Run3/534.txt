The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_AlbumTrackCount` which is a subclass of `Cl_Album`, and it has a datatype property `trackCount` that specifies the number of tracks in an album. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the number of tracks for a particular album.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?trackCount
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTracks ?trackCountInfo .
  ?trackCountInfo :trackCount ?trackCount .
}
```
