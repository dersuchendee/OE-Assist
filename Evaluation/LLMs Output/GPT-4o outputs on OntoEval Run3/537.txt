The competency question "When was a certain album released?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Album` with a data property `hasReleaseDate` that specifies the release date of an album. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the release date of a specific album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasReleaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

This query retrieves all albums and their respective release dates from the ontology. If you want to find the release date of a specific album, you can add a filter condition to the query, such as:

```sparql
SELECT ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :hasReleaseDate ?releaseDate ;
         :hasName "Stadium Arcadium" .
}
```

This query will return the release date of the album "Stadium Arcadium".
