The competency question "What are the actors involved in this value network?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines the class `:Actor` and its relationships with roles and material flows, which allows us to query for actors involved in the value network.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}
```
