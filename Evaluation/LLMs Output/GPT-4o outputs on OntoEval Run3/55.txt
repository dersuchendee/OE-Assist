**No**

The ontology does not directly support querying which materials a product consists of, as the relationship between products and materials is mediated by the `Cl_ProductComposition` class. However, we can extract a partial answer by querying the `Cl_ProductComposition` instances associated with products and their materials.

```sparql
SELECT ?product ?material
WHERE {
  ?product a :Cl_Product .
  ?product :consistsOf ?composition .
  ?composition :hasMaterial ?material .
}
```
