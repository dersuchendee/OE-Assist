**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about albums or their release dates. Therefore, the competency question "When was a certain album released?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to albums if they were present in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
}
```

This query would list all instances of albums if they were defined in the ontology, but it would not provide release dates as the ontology lacks the necessary properties and data.
