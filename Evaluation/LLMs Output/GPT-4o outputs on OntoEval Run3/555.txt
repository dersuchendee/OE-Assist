**No**

The ontology provided does not include any properties or classes related to the release date of an album. Therefore, the competency question "When was a certain album released?" cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, a partial query can be constructed to retrieve albums, but it will not include release dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
}
```
