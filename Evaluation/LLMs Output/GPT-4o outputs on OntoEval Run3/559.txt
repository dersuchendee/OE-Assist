**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct relationship between a specific track and the song it is a recording of. The ontology defines a `Track` class and a `MusicalWork` class, but there is no property that directly links a `Track` to a `MusicalWork` it is a recording of. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information about tracks:

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?trackLabel ?album ?albumLabel
WHERE {
  ?track a :Track .
  OPTIONAL { ?track rdfs:label ?trackLabel . }
  ?track :isTrackOf ?album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
}
```
