**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a track and the song it is a recording of. The ontology defines `ns1:Track` and `ns1:Song` as separate classes, and while a track can be associated with an album via `ns1:hasTrack`, there is no explicit property linking a track to a song. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract tracks and their associated albums:

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?trackLabel ?album ?albumLabel
WHERE {
  ?album a ns1:Album .
  ?album ns1:hasTrack ?track .
  OPTIONAL { ?track rdfs:label ?trackLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
}
```
