**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct relationship between a track and the song it is a recording of. The ontology includes classes for `Track` and `Song`, but there is no explicit connection between them in the provided ontology. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only extract partial information about tracks and songs separately.

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?trackTitle ?album ?albumTitle
WHERE {
  ?track a :Track .
  ?track :trackTitle ?trackTitle .
  ?track :isTrackOf ?album .
  ?album :albumTitle ?albumTitle .
}
```
