The competency question "What song is a specific track a recording of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate tracks to songs, specifically through the `:hasSong` property which connects `:Cl_TrackRecording` to `:Cl_Song`. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?trackName ?song ?songName
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_TrackRecording .
  ?track :hasSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?track :trackName ?trackName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?song :songName ?songName . }
}
```
