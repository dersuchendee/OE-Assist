The competency question "What song is a specific track a recording of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Track` and the object property `:isRecordingOf` which links a track to a song. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?song .
}
```
