The competency question "When was a certain song composed?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_SongComposition` with a property `composedOn` that links to a date, and the class `Cl_Song` with a property `hasComposition` that links to `Cl_SongComposition`. This allows us to query for the composition date of a song.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :hasComposition ?composition .
  ?composition a :Cl_SongComposition .
  ?composition :composedOn ?compositionDate .
}
```
