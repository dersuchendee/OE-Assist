**No**

The ontology does not provide sufficient information to answer the competency question about the chemical composition of a material. The ontology defines a class for chemical composition and properties related to it, but it does not define a class or properties for materials themselves, nor does it provide a way to link specific materials to their chemical compositions.

Partial answer SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?chemicalComposition ?element ?atomicPercentage
WHERE {
  ?chemicalComposition a :Cl_ChemicalComposition .
  OPTIONAL { ?chemicalComposition :hasElement ?element . }
  OPTIONAL { ?chemicalComposition :hasAtomicPercentage ?atomicPercentage . }
}
```
