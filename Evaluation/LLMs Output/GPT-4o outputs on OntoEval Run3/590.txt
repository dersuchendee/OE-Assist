The competency question "When was a certain song composed?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to songs and their composition dates, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the composition date of a specific song.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the composition date of a specific song:

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :composedOn ?composition .
  ?composition :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
```
