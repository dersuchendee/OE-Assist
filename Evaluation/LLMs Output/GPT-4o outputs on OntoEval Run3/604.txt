**No**

The ontology does not directly support querying what a certain critic says about a certain record. The ontology includes classes and properties related to critics and albums, but it lacks a direct connection between a critic and their specific review content about an album. The ontology uses a reification approach with `Cl_CriticReview`, but it does not provide a direct way to query the content of a review by a specific critic for a specific album.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?critic ?album ?review
WHERE {
  ?reviewInstance a :Cl_CriticReview .
  ?reviewInstance :hasCritic ?critic .
  ?reviewInstance :concernsAlbum ?album .
  ?reviewInstance :hasReview ?review .
}
```

This query retrieves critics, albums, and review content, but it does not directly answer the competency question about what a specific critic says about a specific record.
