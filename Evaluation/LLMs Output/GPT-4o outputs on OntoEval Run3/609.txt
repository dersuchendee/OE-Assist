The competency question "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to critics, records, and reviews, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the desired information.

```sparql
SELECT ?critic ?record ?reviewText
WHERE {
  ?critic a :Cl_Critic .
  ?critic :madeReview ?review .
  ?record a :Cl_Record .
  ?record :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :reviewText ?reviewText .
}
```

This query retrieves the critic, record, and review text, effectively answering the competency question.
