**No**

The ontology provided does not include any information about critics or reviews of records. Therefore, the competency question "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" cannot be fully answered using the current ontology. However, we can extract partial information about albums and their reviews, but not specifically about what a critic says.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract partial information about albums and their reviews:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?review ?statement
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :reviewedBy ?review .
  OPTIONAL { ?review :statement ?statement . }
}
```
