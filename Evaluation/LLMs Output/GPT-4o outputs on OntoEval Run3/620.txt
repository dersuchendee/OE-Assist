The competency question "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate critics to their reviews of albums, which allows us to extract the desired information.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?critic ?album ?reviewText
WHERE {
  ?review rdf:type :Cl_CriticReview .
  ?review :reviewedBy ?critic .
  ?review :reviews ?album .
  ?review :reviewText ?reviewText .
}
```

This query retrieves the critic, the album they reviewed, and the text of the review, which directly answers the competency question.
