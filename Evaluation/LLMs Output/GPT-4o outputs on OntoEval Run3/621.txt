**No**

The ontology does not contain any properties or classes that directly relate to critics or their opinions about records. However, we can extract partial information about records and critiques.

```sparql
SELECT ?record ?critique
WHERE {
  ?critique a :Cl_Critique .
  ?critique :critiqueOfRecord ?record .
}
```
