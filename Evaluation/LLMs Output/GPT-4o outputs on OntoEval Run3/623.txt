**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a critic and a record, nor does it provide a way to capture what a critic says about a record. The ontology includes classes and properties related to critics and critiques, but it lacks the necessary structure to directly answer the competency question.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?critic ?critiqueText ?record
WHERE {
  ?critic a :Cl_Critic .
  ?critic :criticizes ?critique .
  ?critique :critiqueText ?critiqueText .
  ?critique :critiqueOf ?record .
}
```
