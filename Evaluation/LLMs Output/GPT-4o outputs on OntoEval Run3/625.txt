**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about critics or records, which are necessary to answer the competency question. However, we can extract partial information about albums and their tracks.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```
