**Yes**

The competency question "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to critics, records, and reviews, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the desired information.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?critic ?record ?reviewText
WHERE {
  ?criticReview a :Cl_CriticReview .
  ?criticReview :reviewedBy ?critic .
  ?criticReview :reviewText ?reviewText .
  ?criticReview :reviewedBy ?record .
}
```

This query retrieves the critic, the record, and the review text, which answers the competency question.
