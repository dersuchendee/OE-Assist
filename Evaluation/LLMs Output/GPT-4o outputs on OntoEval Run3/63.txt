**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the type of a specific resource. The ontology defines classes for different types of resources (Product, Component, Material, etc.) but does not provide a direct property or mechanism to query the type of a specific resource instance. A partial answer can be obtained by querying the class of a resource, but it does not directly answer the CQ as it requires inferring the type based on class membership.

```sparql
SELECT ?resource ?type
WHERE {
  ?resource a ?type .
  FILTER(?type IN (:Cl_Product, :Cl_Component, :Cl_Material, :Cl_Consumable, :Cl_Catalyst))
}
```
