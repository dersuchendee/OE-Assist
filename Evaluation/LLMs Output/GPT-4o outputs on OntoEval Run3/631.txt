The competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances, such as `Performance`, `hasDate`, and `hasPerformer`. We can write a SPARQL query to extract the date of a specific performance.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance ;
               :hasDate ?date .
}
```
