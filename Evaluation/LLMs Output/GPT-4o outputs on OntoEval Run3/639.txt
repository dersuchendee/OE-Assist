**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific performance took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances, such as `Cl_Performance` and `performanceDate`, but it does not link specific performances to specific dates in a way that can be queried directly for a specific performance.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available performance dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?date .
}
```
