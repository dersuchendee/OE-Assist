**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about performances or their dates. Therefore, we cannot directly answer the competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information related to performances if they were present.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```
