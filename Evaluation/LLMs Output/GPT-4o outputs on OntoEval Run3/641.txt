The competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Performance` and the data property `performanceDate`, which allows us to query for the date of a specific performance.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?date .
}
```
