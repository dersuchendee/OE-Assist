**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about performances or their dates. Therefore, the competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to performances, if any were present.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate . }
}
```
