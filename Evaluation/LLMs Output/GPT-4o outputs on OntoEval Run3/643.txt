**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about performances or their dates. Therefore, we cannot directly answer the competency question about when a certain performance took place. However, we can extract partial information about performances that are related to songs.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```
