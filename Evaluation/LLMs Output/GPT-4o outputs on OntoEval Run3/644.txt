**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific performance took place. The ontology includes a `performanceDate` property for the `Cl_Performance` class, but there is no direct connection between a specific performance and its date. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for performances and their dates, but it won't specify which performance took place on a certain date.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?date .
}
```
