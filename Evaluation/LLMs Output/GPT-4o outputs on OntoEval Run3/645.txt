**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific performance took place. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Performance` with a property `performedDuring` that links to a `xsd:dateTime`, but there is no direct connection to a specific performance instance or a way to query for a specific performance date.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available performance dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?dateTime
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedDuring ?dateTime .
}
```
