**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about performances or their dates. Therefore, the competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial query can be constructed to retrieve any available performance-related data, if it existed in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performanceParticipation a :Cl_PerformanceParticipation .
  ?performanceParticipation :performance ?performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performanceParticipation :performanceDate ?date . }
}
```
