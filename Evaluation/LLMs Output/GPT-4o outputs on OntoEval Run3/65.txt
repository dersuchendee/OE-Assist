The competency question "What are the components of this product?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Product` and a reification class `Cl_ProductComponent` that connects products to their components. The `isComposedOf` property links `Cl_ProductComponent` to `Cl_Material`, which represents the components of the product.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the components of a product:

```sparql
SELECT ?product ?component ?material
WHERE {
  ?product a :Cl_Product .
  ?product :hasComponent ?component .
  ?component :isComposedOf ?material .
}
```
