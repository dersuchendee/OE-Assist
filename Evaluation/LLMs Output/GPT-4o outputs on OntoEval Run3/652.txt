**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate songs with specific performances. While there are classes and properties related to performances and tracks, there is no explicit connection between a performance and the songs played during that performance. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists performances and their associated music groups:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?musicGroup
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?performance :hasPerformanceDate ?performanceDate .
  ?performance :performedBy ?musicGroup .
}
```
