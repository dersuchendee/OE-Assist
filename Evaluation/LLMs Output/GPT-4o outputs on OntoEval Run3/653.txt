**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate specific songs with specific performances beyond the example of "Hump de Bump" in the Portland performance. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying performances and their associated songs, but it may not cover all songs played in a performance.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a ns1:Performance .
  ?performance ns1:hasSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
```
