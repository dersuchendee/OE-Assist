**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct relationships or properties that connect performances to the songs played during those performances. The ontology includes classes and properties related to songs, tracks, albums, and performances, but it lacks a direct link between a performance and the specific songs played during that performance.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list performances and tracks, but it won't directly answer the CQ about which songs were played in a specific performance:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?track
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
}
```
