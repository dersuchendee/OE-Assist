**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any properties or classes that directly relate to performances or songs played during performances. Therefore, the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying performances, but without the specific songs played.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
}
```
