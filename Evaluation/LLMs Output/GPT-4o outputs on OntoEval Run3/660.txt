**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct classes or properties that relate to performances or songs played in performances. Therefore, the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to performances and songs, if any, using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?song
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :hasSong ?performanceSong .
  ?performanceSong a :Cl_PerformanceSong .
  ?performanceSong :playedInPerformance ?song .
}
```

This query attempts to find any relationships between performances and songs, but given the ontology, it is unlikely to return complete or meaningful results for the competency question.
