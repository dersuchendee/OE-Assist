**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about performances or songs played during performances. However, we can extract partial information about the songs and albums.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?song .
}
```
