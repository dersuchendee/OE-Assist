**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about performances or songs played during performances. Therefore, the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about performances and their dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```
