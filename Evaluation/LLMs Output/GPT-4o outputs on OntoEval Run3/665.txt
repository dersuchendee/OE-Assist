**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate songs with specific performances. The ontology includes classes and properties for performances and songs, but it lacks a direct relationship between a performance and the songs played during that performance. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by listing the performances and songs separately, but not linking them together.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?song
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
  
  ?song rdf:type :Cl_Song .
}
```
