**No**

The ontology does not provide direct information about resources, such as their types, compositions, or usage in process steps, without additional context or instances. However, a partial answer can be extracted by querying the available classes and properties related to resources.

```sparql
SELECT ?resource ?type ?composition ?processStep
WHERE {
  ?resource a :Cl_Resource .
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :isTypeOf ?type . }
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :hasComposition ?composition . }
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :usedIn ?processStep . }
}
```
