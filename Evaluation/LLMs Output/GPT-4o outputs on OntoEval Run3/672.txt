**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to performances or songs played during performances. Therefore, the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to performances and songs, if any, using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?song
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?performance :performedSongs ?performanceSong .
    ?performanceSong :includesSong ?song .
  }
}
```

This query attempts to find any performances and associated songs, but without specific data instances or properties directly linking performances to songs, it may not return meaningful results.
