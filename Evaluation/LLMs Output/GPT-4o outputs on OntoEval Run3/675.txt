**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a performance. However, we can extract partial information about performances and their dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?performance :hasPerformanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```
