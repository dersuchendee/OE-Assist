**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the location of performances. It only contains information about bands, musicians, and their performances, but not the specific locations where these performances took place. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying performances and their associated bands.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?band
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  ?performance :hasPerformer ?band .
}
```
