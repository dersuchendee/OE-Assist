**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the location of performances. However, we can extract partial information about performances and their associated bands or agents.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?agent ?agentName
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  ?performance :performedBy ?agent .
  ?agent :agentName ?agentName .
}
```
