**No**

The ontology does not provide specific properties or classes that directly relate to the detailed information about a resource, such as its specific attributes or characteristics beyond its type and composition. The ontology primarily focuses on the classification of resources and their roles in process steps within a circular value network. Therefore, a SPARQL query can only extract partial information based on the available ontology structure.

```sparql
SELECT ?resource ?type ?composition
WHERE {
  ?resource a :Resource .
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :hasType ?type . }
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :hasComposition ?composition . }
}
```
