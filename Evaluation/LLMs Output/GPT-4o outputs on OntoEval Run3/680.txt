**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties that directly relate to performances or their locations. Therefore, the competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can attempt to extract partial information related to performances, if any, but the location information will be missing.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
}
```
