**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about performances or venues, which are necessary to answer the competency question about where a certain performance took place. However, we can extract partial information about performances that are recorded in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```
