**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the specific location where a performance took place. It includes classes and properties related to performances, venues, and cities, but it does not explicitly link a performance to a specific venue or city in a way that can be queried directly for a specific performance's location.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?venue ?city
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?performance :takesPlaceIn ?venue .
    ?venue :locatedIn ?city .
  }
}
```
