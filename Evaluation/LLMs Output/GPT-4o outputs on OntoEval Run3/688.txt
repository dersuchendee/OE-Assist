The competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to determine the location of a performance. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :tookPlaceAt ?location .
  ?location :locationName ?locationName .
}
```
