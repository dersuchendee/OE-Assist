**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the location of a specific performance. However, we can extract partial information about performances and their associated songs.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?song
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?performanceSong :performedAt ?performance .
    ?performanceSong :performedSong ?song .
  }
}
```
