**Yes**

The competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances and their locations, which allows us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the location of a specific performance.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceLocation ?location .
}
```

This query retrieves the location of each performance by querying the `:performanceLocation` property of the `:Cl_Performance` class.
