The competency question "Which is the context of production of a source?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `ContextOfProduction` and the object property `hasContextOfProduction` that links an `Organ` to its `ContextOfProduction`. Although the CQ asks for the context of production of a "source," the ontology provides a way to query the context of production of an "organ," which can be interpreted as a source in this context.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the context of production of an organ:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?context ?productionTime ?productionLocation ?organBuilder
WHERE {
  ?organ a :Organ .
  ?organ :hasContextOfProduction ?context .
  OPTIONAL { ?context :hasProductionTime ?productionTime . }
  OPTIONAL { ?context :hasProductionLocation ?productionLocation . }
  OPTIONAL { ?context :ProducedBy ?organBuilder . }
}
```
