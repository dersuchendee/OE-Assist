The competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate cities to regions, allowing us to construct a SPARQL query to find the region in which a city is located.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedInRegion ?cityRegion .
  ?cityRegion :hasCity ?region .
}
```
