**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and a region, which is necessary to answer the competency question. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the city and its associated region.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?region .
}
```
