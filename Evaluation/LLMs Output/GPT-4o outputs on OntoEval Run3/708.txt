**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct relationship between a city and a region, which is necessary to answer the competency question about the region in which a certain city is located. However, we can extract partial information about cities and regions.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :locatedIn ?region . }
}
```
