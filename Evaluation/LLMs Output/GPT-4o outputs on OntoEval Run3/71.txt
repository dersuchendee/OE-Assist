The competency question "What are the materials of this component or product?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology provides a way to connect a product to its material composition and then to the materials themselves through the object properties `op_hasMaterialComposition` and `op_composedOf`.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?product ?material
WHERE {
  ?product a :Cl_Product .
  ?product :op_hasMaterialComposition ?composition .
  ?composition :op_composedOf ?material .
}
```
