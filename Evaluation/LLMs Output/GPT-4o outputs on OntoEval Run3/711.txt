**No**

The competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" is not fully supported by the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to locations, cities, and regions, but it does not provide a direct way to query the region of a specific city. The ontology does have a `locatedIn` property for cities and a `regionInCountry` property for regions, but it lacks a direct connection between a city and its region.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which attempts to find the region of a city if such a connection were present:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?city :locatedIn ?region .
    ?region a :Cl_Region .
  }
}
```

This query will return cities and their associated regions if the `locatedIn` property is used to connect cities to regions, but the ontology does not explicitly define this connection.
