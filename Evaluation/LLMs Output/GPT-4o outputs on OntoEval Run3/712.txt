**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the region in which a city is located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to cities and regions, but it lacks the necessary relationships to directly answer the competency question. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying cities and their potential regions.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :isLocatedIn ?region . }
}
```
