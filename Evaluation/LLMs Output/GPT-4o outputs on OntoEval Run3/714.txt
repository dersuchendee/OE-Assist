**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the region in which a city is located. However, it does provide a partial answer by identifying cities and their potential regions.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :locatedIn ?region . }
}
```
