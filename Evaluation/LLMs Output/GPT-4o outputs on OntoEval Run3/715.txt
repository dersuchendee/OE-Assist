The competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the classes `Cl_City` and `Cl_Region`, and the object property `locatedIn` which connects a city to a region. Therefore, a SPARQL query can be constructed to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?region .
}
```
