**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about cities or regions, nor does it have any properties that relate cities to regions. Therefore, the competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, a partial query can be constructed to list cities, but it will not provide the regions they are located in.

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
}
```
