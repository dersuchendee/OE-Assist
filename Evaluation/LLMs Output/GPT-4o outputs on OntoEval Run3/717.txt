**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the region in which a city is located. The ontology includes classes for `Cl_City` and `Cl_Region`, and an object property `locatedInRegion` that connects a city to a region. However, the competency question requires a specific city to be queried for its region, which is not directly supported by the ontology as it stands.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists cities and their associated regions if such data were available:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedInRegion ?region .
}
```
