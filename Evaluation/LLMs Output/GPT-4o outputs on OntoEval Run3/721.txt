The competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" is not fully supported by the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to music, bands, albums, and performances, but it does not include any information about geographic locations or countries. However, there is a partial answer that can be extracted based on the limited geographic information available in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  ?region :op_isLocatedIn ?country .
}
```

This query will return any regions and their associated countries if such data were present in the ontology, but the ontology does not currently contain instances of regions or countries.
