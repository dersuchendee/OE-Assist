**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the country in which a specific region is located. The ontology includes classes and properties related to locations, cities, regions, and countries, but it lacks a direct connection or property that links a specific region to a country. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying regions, but not their corresponding countries.

```sparql
SELECT ?region
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
}
```
