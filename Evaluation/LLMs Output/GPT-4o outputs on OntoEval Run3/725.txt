**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the country in which a region is located. However, we can extract partial information about regions and their hierarchical relationships.

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?regionName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?region a :Region .
  ?region :placeName ?regionName .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?region :isPartOf ?country .
    ?country a :Country .
    ?country :placeName ?countryName .
  }
}
```
