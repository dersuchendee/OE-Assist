**No**

The competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" is not fully supported by the ontology. The ontology provides classes and properties related to cities, regions, and countries, but it does not directly provide a way to query the country of a specific region. However, we can extract a partial answer by querying the regions and their associated countries.

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  ?region :partOf ?country .
}
```
