**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the country in which a region is located. However, we can extract partial information about regions and their associated countries if such data were available.

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?region :locatedInCountry ?regionCountry .
    ?regionCountry :countryOf ?country .
  }
}
```
