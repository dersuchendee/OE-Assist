**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the country in which a region is located. The ontology includes classes and properties for cities, regions, and countries, but it lacks a direct connection between regions and countries. The `regionInCountry` property is defined, but it is not used in the ontology to connect any instances of regions to countries.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list regions without their corresponding countries:

```sparql
SELECT ?region
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
}
```
