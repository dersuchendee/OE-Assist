**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about regions or countries, which is necessary to answer the competency question "In what country is a certain region located?". Therefore, the competency question is not fully supported by the ontology. However, we can extract partial information about regions if they were present.

```sparql
SELECT ?region
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
}
```
