**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the specific dates when a theatre festival took place. The `hasDate` property is associated with `TheatreFestival`, but there is no direct connection to specific instances of theatre festivals with their respective dates in the ontology. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasName ?festivalName .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :hasDate ?date . }
}
```
