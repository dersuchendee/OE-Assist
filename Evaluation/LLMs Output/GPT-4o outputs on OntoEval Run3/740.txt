The competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate regions to countries, specifically the `:locatedInCountry` object property which connects `:Cl_Region` to `:Cl_Country`.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  ?region :locatedInCountry ?country .
}
```
