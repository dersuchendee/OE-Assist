**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any information about countries or regions being located within countries. Therefore, the competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology. However, we can extract partial information about regions and their relationships with other entities.

```sparql
SELECT ?region
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
}
```
