**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a reification class `:Cl_RecordContainsTrack` that ensures an album always contains at least one track through the `:containsTrack` and `:trackContained` properties. Here's a SPARQL query to verify this:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
  ?album :containsTrack ?record .
  ?record :trackContained ?track .
}
```
