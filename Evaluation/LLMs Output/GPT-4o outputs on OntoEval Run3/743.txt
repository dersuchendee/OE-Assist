**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Album` class that specifies it must have at least one `Track`. This can be verified with the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
```
