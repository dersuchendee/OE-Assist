**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to music, albums, tracks, or recordings. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SPARQL query to answer the competency question about records and tracks. However, a partial query can be written to extract information about the classes and properties that do exist in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?class ?property
WHERE {
  ?class a owl:Class .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?property a owl:ObjectProperty .
  }
}
```
