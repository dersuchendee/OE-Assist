**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to music, albums, tracks, or recordings. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SPARQL query to answer the competency question about records and tracks. However, a partial query could be written to extract information about publications, which is the closest concept available in the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?publicationLabel
WHERE {
  ?publication a ns1:Publication .
  OPTIONAL { ?publication rdfs:label ?publicationLabel . }
}
```
