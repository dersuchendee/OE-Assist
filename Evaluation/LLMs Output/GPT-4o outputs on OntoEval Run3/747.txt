**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any classes or properties related to music, albums, tracks, or recordings. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SPARQL query to answer the competency question "A record always contains at least one track." However, a partial query can be written to extract any information related to publications, which might be the closest concept available in the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?title
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  OPTIONAL { ?publication :title ?title . }
}
```
