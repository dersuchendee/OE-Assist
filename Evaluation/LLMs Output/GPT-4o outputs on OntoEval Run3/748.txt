**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology defines an `Album` class with a restriction that it must have at least one `Track`. This can be verified using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumTitle
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album .
  ?album :albumTitle ?albumTitle .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
```

This query retrieves all albums that have at least one track, confirming that the ontology enforces the constraint that an album must contain at least one track.
