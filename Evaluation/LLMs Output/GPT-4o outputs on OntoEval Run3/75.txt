**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the dates of theatre festivals. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre productions, festivals, and their occurrences, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific festival and its date. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the festival names and their occurrences:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?occurrence ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasName ?festivalName .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?occurrence a :Cl_FestivalOccurrence .
    ?occurrence :occursIn ?city .
    ?occurrence :hasDate ?date .
  }
}
```
