**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Album` with a restriction that enforces a minimum cardinality of 1 on the property `containsTrack`, which means that every album must contain at least one track. This aligns with the competency question.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that every album contains at least one track:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```

This query retrieves all albums that contain at least one track, confirming the competency question.
