**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model the concept of a "record" containing "tracks" in a way that ensures a record always contains at least one track. The ontology includes classes and properties related to albums, tracks, and recordings, but it does not enforce a constraint that a record must contain at least one track. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract information about records and tracks:

```sparql
SELECT ?record ?track
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Record .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?record :containsTrack ?track .
  }
}
```
