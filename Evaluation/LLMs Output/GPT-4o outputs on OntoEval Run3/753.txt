**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the class `Cl_Album` that specifies it must have at least one `Cl_Track` through the `containsTrack` property. This aligns with the competency question.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that every album contains at least one track:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```

This query will return all albums that contain at least one track, confirming the competency question is modeled by the ontology.
