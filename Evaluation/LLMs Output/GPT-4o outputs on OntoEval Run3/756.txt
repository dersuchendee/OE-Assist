**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes a restriction on the `Cl_Album` class that specifies it must have at least one `containsTrack` relationship, which aligns with the competency question. Here is a SPARQL query to verify this:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```
