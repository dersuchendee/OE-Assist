**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology defines the class `Cl_Album` with an equivalent class restriction that ensures an album must contain at least one track (`owl:minCardinality 1` on the `containsTrack` property). This aligns with the competency question that a record (album) always contains at least one track.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify this:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```
