**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Album` and the object property `containsTrack` which links an album to a track. This allows us to verify that every album (record) contains at least one track.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```

This query retrieves all albums that contain at least one track, thus confirming that a record always contains at least one track.
