**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_Record` and the object property `hasTrack` which connects a record to a track. This implies that a record can have one or more tracks associated with it.

Here is a SPARQL query to verify that every record contains at least one track:

```sparql
SELECT ?record
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Record .
  ?record :hasTrack ?track .
}
```

This query retrieves all records that have at least one track associated with them, thus confirming that a record always contains at least one track.
