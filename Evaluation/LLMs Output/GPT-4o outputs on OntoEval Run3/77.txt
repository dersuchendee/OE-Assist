**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the specific dates when a theatre festival took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, productions, and events, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific festival and its occurrence dates. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the available information about theatre festivals:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a theatre:TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival theatre:hasStartDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?festival theatre:hasEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves the start and end dates of theatre festivals, but it may not provide a complete answer to the competency question as it does not directly link to specific theatre festivals and their occurrence dates.
