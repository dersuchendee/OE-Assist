**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with their medical degrees. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, degrees, and study events, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and their medical degrees. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?degree a :Cl_MedicalDegree .
}
```
