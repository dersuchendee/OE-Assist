**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with their medical degrees. The ontology includes classes and properties related to degrees and fields of study, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and their specific medical degrees. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists degrees and their fields of study, but not directly linked to a person:

```sparql
SELECT ?degree ?degreeName ?fieldOfStudy
WHERE {
  ?degree a :MedicalDegree .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeName ?degreeName . }
  ?degree :hasFieldOfStudy ?fieldOfStudy .
}
```
