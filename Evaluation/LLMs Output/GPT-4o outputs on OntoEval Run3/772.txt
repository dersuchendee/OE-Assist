**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for medical degrees associated with a person. The ontology includes classes and properties related to medical degrees, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and their medical degrees. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?degree a :Cl_MedicalDegree .
}
```
