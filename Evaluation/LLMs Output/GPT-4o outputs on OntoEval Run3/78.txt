**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the date of a theatre festival. The ontology includes classes and properties related to festivals and occurrences, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific festival and its occurrence date. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?occurrence ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasFestivalOccurrence ?occurrence .
  OPTIONAL { ?occurrence :occurredOnDate ?date . }
}
```
