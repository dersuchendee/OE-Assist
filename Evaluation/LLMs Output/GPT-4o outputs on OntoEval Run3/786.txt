**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the medical degrees of a specific person. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Person` and a class `Cl_MedicalDegree`, and there is an object property `hasMedicalDegree` that connects a person to a medical degree. However, the ontology does not include any specific individuals or instances of these classes, nor does it provide a way to query for a specific person's medical degrees.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list all persons and their associated medical degrees if such instances were present in the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
}
```

This query assumes that there are instances of `Cl_Person` and `Cl_MedicalDegree` in the ontology, which are not provided in the current ontology definition.
