**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the specific dates when a theatre festival took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to events, locations, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between a theatre festival and its specific start and end dates. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, focusing on the theatre festivals and their associated cities:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :hasName ?festivalName . }
  ?festival :takesPlaceIn ?city .
}
```

This query retrieves the theatre festivals and the cities where they take place, but it does not provide the specific dates of the festivals.
