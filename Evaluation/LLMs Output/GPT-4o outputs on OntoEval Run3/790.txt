**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine the time period during which a person studied for a specific degree. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, degrees, and study periods, but it lacks the necessary connections to answer the competency question directly. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeTitle ?obtainedDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeObtainedDate ?obtainedDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves the person, the degree they obtained, the title of the degree, and the date the degree was obtained, but it does not provide the study period.
