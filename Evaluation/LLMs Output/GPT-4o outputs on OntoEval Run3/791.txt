**No**

The ontology does not provide explicit information about the start date of the study period for a specific degree. The ontology only provides the end date for the study period for the Certified Nurse Degree, but not the start date. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a ns1:Person .
  ?person ns1:hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod ns1:studiesFor ?degree .
  ?studyPeriod ns1:hasEndDate ?endDate .
}
