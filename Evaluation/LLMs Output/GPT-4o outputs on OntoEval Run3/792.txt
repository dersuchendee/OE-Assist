**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to relate a person to the specific time period during which they studied for a specific degree. The ontology includes classes and properties related to study periods, degrees, and persons, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the specific time period of their study for a degree.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyPeriod ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :studiesFor ?degree .
  ?degree :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :hasStartDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :hasEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```
