**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to link a person to a specific degree and the time period during which they studied for it. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, degrees, and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements to answer the competency question. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?degree a :Cl_Degree .
  ?timePeriod a :Cl_TimePeriod .
  OPTIONAL { ?timePeriod :hasStartDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?timePeriod :hasEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```
