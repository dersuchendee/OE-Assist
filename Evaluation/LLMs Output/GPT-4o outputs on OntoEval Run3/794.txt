**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to extract the time period during which a person studied for a specific degree. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, degrees, and study events, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the time interval of their study for a specific degree. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?studyEvent a :StudyEvent .
  ?studyEvent :hasParticipant ?person .
  ?studyEvent :hasDegree ?degree .
  ?studyEvent :hasTimeInterval ?timeInterval .
  ?timeInterval :startDate ?startDate .
  ?timeInterval :endDate ?endDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the study events, participants, degrees, and time intervals, but it does not directly link a specific person to a specific degree with a time period.
