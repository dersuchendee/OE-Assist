**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific degree and the time period during which they studied for it. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, medical degrees, and study periods, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the specific degree they studied for, along with the time period.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyPeriod
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :studiedFor ?study .
  ?study a :Cl_PersonDegreeStudy .
  ?study :studyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
}
```

This query retrieves persons and their study periods, but it does not directly link them to a specific degree.
