**No**

The ontology does not provide information about the specific time period during which a person studied for a specific degree. It only provides the degree obtained date and the end date of the study period, but not the start date. Therefore, a complete answer to the competency question cannot be extracted.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeTitle ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle .
  ?degree :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
}
```
