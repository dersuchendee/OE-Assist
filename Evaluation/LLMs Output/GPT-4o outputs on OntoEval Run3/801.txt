**No**

The ontology does not provide explicit information about the study period for a specific degree. The ontology includes a `Cl_StudyPeriod` class, but the start date for the study period is marked as "UNKNOWN". Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question. However, we can extract partial information about the degree obtained and its end date.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeTitle ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle .
  ?degree :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
}
```
