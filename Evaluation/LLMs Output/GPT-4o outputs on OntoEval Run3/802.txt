The competency question "During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate a person to their study periods and the degrees they studied for, along with the start and end dates of these study periods.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?studyPeriod a :Cl_StudyPeriod ;
               :studiedBy ?person ;
               :studiedFor ?degree ;
               :studyStartDate ?startDate ;
               :studyEndDate ?endDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, the degree they studied for, and the start and end dates of their study periods, which directly answers the competency question.
