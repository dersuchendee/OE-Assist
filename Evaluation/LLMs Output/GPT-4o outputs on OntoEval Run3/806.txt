**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific person with a specific degree and the time period during which they studied for that degree. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, medical degrees, and study periods, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, a specific degree, and the corresponding study period.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyStart ?studyEnd
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?person :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :studyStart ?studyStart .
  ?studyPeriod :studyEnd ?studyEnd .
}
