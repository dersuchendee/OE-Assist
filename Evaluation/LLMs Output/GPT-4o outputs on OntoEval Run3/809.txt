**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a specific person with a specific degree and the time period during which they studied for that degree. The ontology includes classes and properties related to study periods and degrees, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, a specific degree, and the associated study period.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?studyPeriod a :Cl_StudyForDegree .
  ?studyPeriod :hasStudent ?person .
  ?studyPeriod :hasDegree ?degree .
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :studyStartDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?studyPeriod :studyEndDate ?endDate . }
}
