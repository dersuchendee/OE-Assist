**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the specific dates when a theatre festival took place. The ontology includes a `date` property for `Cl_TheatreFestival`, but there is no instance data provided in the ontology to query against. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for theatre festivals and their associated dates, but without specific instance data, the query will not return any results.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :date ?date .
}
```
