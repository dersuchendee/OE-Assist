**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a person was first employed at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment, hospitals, and dates, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the specific date of their first employment at a hospital. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?employment ?hospital ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment :hospital ?hospital .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
}
```
