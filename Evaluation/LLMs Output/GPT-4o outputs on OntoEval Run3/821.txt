**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a person was first employed at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the specific hospital where they were first employed. The ontology does not capture the temporal aspect of employment history directly.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital ?employmentDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?employment a :Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment .
  ?person :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentDate ?employmentDate .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
}
ORDER BY ?person ?employmentDate
```
