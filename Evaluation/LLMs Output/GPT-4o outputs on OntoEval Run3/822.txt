**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the employment start date of a person at a hospital. The closest information available is the employment start date of an employment instance, but it is not directly linked to a specific person and hospital in a way that answers the competency question. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?employment ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
}
```
