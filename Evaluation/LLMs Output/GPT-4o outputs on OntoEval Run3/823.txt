**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the employment start date of a person at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment, hospitals, and people, but it lacks the specific data property or object property that directly connects a person to the start date of their employment at a hospital.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?employment ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentInHospital ?hospital .
}
```
