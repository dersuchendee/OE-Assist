**No**

The ontology does not contain information about the employment start date of a person at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment, hospitals, and people, but it does not explicitly capture the start date of employment at a hospital. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?employment ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
}
```
