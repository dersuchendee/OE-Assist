**No**

The ontology does not contain information about the employment start date of a person at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, medical degrees, hospitals, and employment, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and their employment start date at a specific hospital.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?employment rdf:type :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :employee ?person .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate . }
}
```
