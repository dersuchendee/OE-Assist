**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the employment of a person at a hospital, specifically the date of employment. The ontology primarily focuses on medical degrees, union memberships, evaluations, and articles. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment ;
              :employee ?person ;
              :employedAt ?hospital .
}
```
