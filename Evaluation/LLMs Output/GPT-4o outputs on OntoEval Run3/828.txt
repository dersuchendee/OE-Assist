**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about employment dates or hospitals where a person is employed. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered. However, we can extract partial information about the person and their medical degrees.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeTitle ?degreeObtainedDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle .
  ?degree :degreeObtainedDate ?degreeObtainedDate .
}
```
