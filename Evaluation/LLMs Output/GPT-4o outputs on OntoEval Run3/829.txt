**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a person was first employed at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the employment date at a specific hospital. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment .
  ?employment :personEmployedAtHospital ?person .
  ?employment :hospitalHasEmployee ?hospital .
}
```
