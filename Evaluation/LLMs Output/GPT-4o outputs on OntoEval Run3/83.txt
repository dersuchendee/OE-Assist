**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific theatre festival took place. The ontology includes a `hasDate` property for `Cl_TheatreFestival`, but it does not specify which festival or provide a mechanism to query for a specific festival's date. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasDate ?date .
}
```
