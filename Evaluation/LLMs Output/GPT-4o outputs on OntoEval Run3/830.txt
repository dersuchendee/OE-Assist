**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a certain person was first employed at a certain hospital. The ontology includes a class for employment and a property for employment start date, but it does not directly link a person to their employment start date at a specific hospital. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
}
```
