**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a person was first employed at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and the specific start date of their employment at a particular hospital. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment .
  ?employment :hasPerson ?person .
  ?employment :hasHospital ?hospital .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the employment start dates for persons at hospitals, but it does not specify the "first" employment date for a person at a particular hospital.
