**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a person was first employed at a specific hospital. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employment, but it does not specify a way to query the first employment date for a person at a hospital. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information about employment:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :hasEmployee ?person .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
}
```
