**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a hospital with a city. The ontology includes properties like `ns1:locatedIn` for associating a hospital with a city, but there is no direct property or class that represents the city of a hospital. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying hospitals and their associated cities.

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?city
WHERE {
  ?hospital a ns1:Hospital .
  ?hospital ns1:locatedIn ?city .
}
```
