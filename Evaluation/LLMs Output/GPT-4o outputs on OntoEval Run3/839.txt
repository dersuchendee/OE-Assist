**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a hospital with a city. The ontology includes classes for hospitals and cities, but there is no explicit relationship between them that would allow us to determine the city in which a hospital is located. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which would list hospitals without their associated cities:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
}
```
