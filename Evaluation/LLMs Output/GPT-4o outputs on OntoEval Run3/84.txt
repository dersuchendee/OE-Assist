**No**

The ontology does not contain any direct information about the specific dates when theatre festivals took place. However, we can extract partial information about the festivals and their occurrences.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?occurrence ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_Festival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence a :Cl_FestivalOccurrence .
  OPTIONAL { ?occurrence :hasDate ?date . }
}
```
