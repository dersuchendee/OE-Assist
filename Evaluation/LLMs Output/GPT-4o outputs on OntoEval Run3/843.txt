**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a hospital with a city. The ontology includes classes and properties related to hospitals, locations, and cities, but there is no direct property that links a hospital to a city. The closest available properties are `:locatedIn` and `:city`, which link hospitals to locations and locations to cities, respectively. However, without specific instances or data, we cannot determine the city for a given hospital.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?location ?city
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?location .
  ?location :city ?city .
}
```
