The competency question "In what city is a certain hospital located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to determine the city in which a hospital is located. Specifically, the `:locatedIn` object property connects a hospital (`:Cl_Hospital`) to a city (`:Cl_City`).

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?city
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
}
```
