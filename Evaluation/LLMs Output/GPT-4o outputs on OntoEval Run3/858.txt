The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to determine the country in which a city is located. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
}
```
