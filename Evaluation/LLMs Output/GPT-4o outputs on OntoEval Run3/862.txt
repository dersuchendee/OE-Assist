The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate cities to countries, specifically through the `:isLocatedIn` object property, which connects instances of `:Cl_City` to instances of `:Cl_Country`. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?cityName ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityName ?cityName .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
  ?country :countryName ?countryName .
}
```
