**No**

The ontology does not contain any information about the countries in which cities are located. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered. However, we can extract partial information about the city and its name.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityName ?cityName .
}
```
