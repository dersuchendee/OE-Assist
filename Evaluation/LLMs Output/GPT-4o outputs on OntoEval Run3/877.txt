**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a city and a country. The ontology only provides a connection between a hospital and a city, and a city and a country. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. However, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying the city in which a hospital is located.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedInCountry ?country .
}
```
