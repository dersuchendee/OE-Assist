**Yes**

The competency question "Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for union memberships, including the members and the start date of their membership. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?staffMember ?union ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?membership :hasMember ?staffMember .
  ?membership :hasUnion ?union .
  ?membership :hasStartDate ?startDate .
}
```
