**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the members of a union at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employees, unions, and union memberships, but it lacks temporal information about union memberships. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying employees who have union memberships, but without the temporal aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?employee ?unionMembership
WHERE {
  ?employee a :Employee .
  ?employee :hasUnionMembership ?unionMembership .
}
```
