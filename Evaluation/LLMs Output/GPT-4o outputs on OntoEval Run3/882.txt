**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a direct representation of time-specific membership data. Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information about union members:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOfUnionGroup ?unionGroup .
  ?unionGroup :hasMember ?person .
  ?unionGroup a :Cl_UnionGroup .
}
```
