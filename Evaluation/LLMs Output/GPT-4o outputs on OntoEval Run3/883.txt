**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate union membership with a specific point in time. While there is a `hasMembershipPeriod` property, it is not directly linked to individuals in a way that allows querying for members at a specific time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?start ?end
WHERE {
  ?membership a ns1:UnionMembership ;
              ns1:hasMember ?person ;
              ns1:hasUnion ?union ;
              ns1:hasMembershipPeriod ?period .
  ?period time:hasBeginning ?start .
  OPTIONAL { ?period time:hasEnd ?end . }
}
```
