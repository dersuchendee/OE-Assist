**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to relate union members to a specific point in time. The ontology includes properties like `hasMemberAt` and `memberOfAt`, but they are not fully implemented with respect to time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union
WHERE {
  ?person a :UnionMember .
  ?person :memberOf ?union .
}
```
