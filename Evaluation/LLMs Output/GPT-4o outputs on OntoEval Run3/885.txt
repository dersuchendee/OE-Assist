**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership, employees, and time points, but it lacks a direct connection between these elements to answer the competency question fully. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?employee ?union ?timePoint
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?membership :hasEmployee ?employee .
  ?membership :hasUnion ?union .
  ?membership :hasTimePoint ?timePoint .
}
```

This query retrieves employees, unions, and time points associated with union memberships, but it does not filter for a specific union or time point as required by the competency question.
