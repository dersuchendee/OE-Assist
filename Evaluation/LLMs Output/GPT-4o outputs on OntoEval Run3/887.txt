**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and time periods, but it lacks a direct connection between a person and their union membership at a specific time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?startTime ?endTime
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?membership :hasUnionRole ?role .
  ?membership :partOfUnionGroup ?union .
  ?membership :unionMembershipDuring ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :startTime ?startTime .
  ?timePeriod :endTime ?endTime .
  ?person :hasUnionMembership ?membership .
}
```
