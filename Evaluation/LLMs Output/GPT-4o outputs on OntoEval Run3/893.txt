**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for union members at a specific point in time. However, we can extract partial information about union memberships and their start dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?membershipStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :isMemberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :memberOf ?union .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
}
```
