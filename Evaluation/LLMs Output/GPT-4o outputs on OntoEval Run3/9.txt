**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the context of usage of a source. The ontology includes classes and properties related to sources, contexts of usage, and reliability, but it does not explicitly define a property or structure that directly links a source to its context of usage in a way that can be queried for a specific context. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?source ?context
WHERE {
  ?source a :Source .
  OPTIONAL { ?source :hasContextOfUsage ?context . }
}
```
