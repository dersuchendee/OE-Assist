**Yes**

The competency question "Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, as well as time points for role assignments. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?timePoint
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :hasPerson ?person ;
              :hasUnion ?union ;
              :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate . }
  
  ?roleAssignment a :Cl_UnionRoleAssignment ;
                  :hasPerson ?person ;
                  :hasUnion ?union ;
                  :hasRole ?role ;
                  :timePoint ?timePoint .
  
  FILTER (?timePoint >= ?startDate)
  FILTER (!BOUND(?endDate) || ?timePoint <= ?endDate)
}
ORDER BY ?union ?timePoint
```

This query retrieves the members of a union, their roles, and the time points of their role assignments, considering the start and optional end dates of their membership.
