**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, unions, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection or a reification class that would allow querying the role of a person within a union group at a specific time.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which retrieves the union roles of persons without considering the time aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?unionRole
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasUnionRole ?unionRole .
}
```
