**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a union at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to unions, roles, and time, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and the time at which they hold that role. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
  ?role a :UnionRole .
  ?role :withinUnion ?union .
}
```
