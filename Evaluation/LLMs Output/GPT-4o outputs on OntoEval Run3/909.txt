**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the role a person has within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and role assignments, but it lacks a direct connection between a person, their role, and the specific union group at a given time.

However, we can extract partial information about union role assignments:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?union ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?roleAssignment a :UnionRoleAssignment .
  ?roleAssignment :hasAgent ?person .
  ?roleAssignment :hasRole ?role .
  ?roleAssignment :inUnion ?union .
  ?roleAssignment :atTime ?timeInterval .
  ?timeInterval :startDate ?startDate .
  ?timeInterval :endDate ?endDate .
}
```

This query retrieves information about union role assignments, including the person, role, union, and the time interval during which the role is held. However, it does not directly answer the competency question as it does not specify the role at a specific point in time.
