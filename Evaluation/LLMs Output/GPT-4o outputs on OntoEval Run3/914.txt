**Yes**

The competency question "What role does a certain person have within a certain union group at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that allow us to query for a person's union membership, the union they are a member of, and the role they hold within that union, along with the start date of that role.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?roleStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasUnionMembership ?unionMembership .
  ?unionMembership :memberOf ?union .
  ?unionMembership :hasUnionRole ?roleInstance .
  ?roleInstance :roleTitle ?role .
  ?roleInstance :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, the union they are a member of, the role they hold, and the start date of that role.
