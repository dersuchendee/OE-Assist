The competency question "What role does a certain person have within a certain union group at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate a person to a union role, including the role name and the time period during which the role is held.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?roleName ?roleStartDate ?roleEndDate
WHERE {
  ?unionRole a :Cl_UnionRole ;
             :roleHolder ?person ;
             :hasUnionRole ?union ;
             :roleName ?roleName ;
             :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?unionRole :roleEndDate ?roleEndDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves the person, the union they are associated with, the role name, and the start and end dates of the role.
