**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a direct temporal component to capture the role at a specific time. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which retrieves the roles held by a person in a union:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?roleName
WHERE {
  ?unionMembership :unionMember ?person .
  ?unionMembership :memberOf ?union .
  ?unionMembership :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleHeldBy ?person .
  ?role :roleInUnion ?union .
  OPTIONAL { ?role :roleName ?roleName . }
}
```
