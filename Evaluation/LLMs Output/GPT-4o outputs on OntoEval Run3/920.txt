**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a direct temporal component to associate roles with specific time points. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which retrieves the roles associated with a person and their union membership:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?roleTitle ?roleStartDate ?roleEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?unionMembership :membershipOf ?person .
  ?role :hasRole ?unionMembership .
  ?role :roleTitle ?roleTitle .
  OPTIONAL { ?role :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?role :roleEndDate ?roleEndDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves the roles and their titles associated with a person, along with optional start and end dates, but it does not directly answer the competency question regarding a specific point in time.
