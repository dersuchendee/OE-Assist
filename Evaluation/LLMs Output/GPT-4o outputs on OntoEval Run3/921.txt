**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to persons, unions, and roles, but it lacks a direct connection or reification that would allow querying for a person's role within a union at a specific time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?roleName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?union .
  ?membership a :Cl_PersonUnionMembership .
  ?membership :personMemberOfUnion ?person .
  ?membership :unionHasMember ?union .
  ?membership :hasUnionRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
}
```
