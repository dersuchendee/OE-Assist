**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for the role of a person within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and role assignments, but it lacks a direct connection to specify the role of a person within a union group at a specific time.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?role ?union ?timePoint
WHERE {
  ?roleAssignment a :Cl_UnionRoleAssignment .
  ?roleAssignment :hasPerson ?person .
  ?roleAssignment :hasRole ?role .
  ?roleAssignment :hasUnion ?union .
  OPTIONAL { ?roleAssignment :timePoint ?timePoint . }
}
```
