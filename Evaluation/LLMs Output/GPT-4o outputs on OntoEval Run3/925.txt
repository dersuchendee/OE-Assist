**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a person with a specific role within a union group at a specific point in time. The ontology includes classes and properties related to union membership and roles, but it lacks a mechanism to specify the temporal aspect of a person's role within a union group.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?role
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipUnion ?union .
  ?person :hasUnionRole ?position .
  ?position :roleInUnion ?role .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, the union they are a member of, and their role within the union, but it does not include the temporal aspect of the role.
