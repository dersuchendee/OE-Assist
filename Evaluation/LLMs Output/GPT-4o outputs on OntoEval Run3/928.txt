**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query for evaluation statements given by a specific doctor for a specific employee. The ontology includes classes and properties related to employees, doctors, and evaluation statements, but it lacks a direct connection between a specific doctor and the evaluation statement they have given for a specific employee.

Partial SPARQL query to extract some related information:

```sparql
SELECT ?doctor ?employee ?evaluationContent
WHERE {
  ?evaluation rdf:type :Cl_EvaluationStatement .
  ?evaluation :evaluatesEmployee ?employee .
  ?evaluation :hasEvaluationContent ?evaluationContent .
}
```

This query retrieves evaluation statements and their content, but it does not specify which doctor gave the evaluation for a specific employee.
