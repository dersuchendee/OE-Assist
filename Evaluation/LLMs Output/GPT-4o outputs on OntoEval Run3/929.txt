The competency question "What is the evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate doctors, employees, and evaluation statements. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the evaluation statement given by a specific doctor for a specific employee:

```sparql
SELECT ?doctorName ?employeeName ?evaluationText ?evaluationDate
WHERE {
  ?evaluation a ns1:EvaluationStatement ;
              ns1:providedBy ?doctor ;
              ns1:evaluates ?employee ;
              ns1:evaluationText ?evaluationText ;
              ns1:evaluationDate ?evaluationDate .

  ?doctor a ns1:Doctor ;
          rdfs:label ?doctorName .

  ?employee a ns1:Employee ;
            rdfs:label ?employeeName .
}
```

This query retrieves the names of the doctor and employee, along with the evaluation text and date, by leveraging the relationships defined in the ontology.
