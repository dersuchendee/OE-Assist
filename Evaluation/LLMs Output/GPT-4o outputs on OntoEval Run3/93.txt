**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine when a specific theatre festival took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, dates, and cities, but it lacks specific instances or data that would allow us to answer the competency question directly. However, we can extract partial information about theatre festivals and their associated dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasDate ?dateEntity .
  ?dateEntity :dateValue ?date .
}
```
