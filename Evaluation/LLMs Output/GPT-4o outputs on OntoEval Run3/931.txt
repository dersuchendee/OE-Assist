The competency question "What is the evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties related to evaluation events, doctors, and employees, which are necessary to extract the required information.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee:

```sparql
SELECT ?doctor ?employee ?evaluationText
WHERE {
  ?evaluationEvent a :Cl_EvaluationEvent .
  ?evaluationEvent :conducts_evaluation_event ?doctor .
  ?evaluationEvent :undergoes_evaluation_event ?employee .
  ?evaluationEvent :evaluation_text ?evaluationText .
}
```

This query retrieves the doctor, employee, and the evaluation text from the ontology, which directly answers the competency question.
