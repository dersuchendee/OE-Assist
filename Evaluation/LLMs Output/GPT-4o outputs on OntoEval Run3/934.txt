The ontology includes classes and properties that relate doctors, employees, and evaluation statements. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?doctor ?employee ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  ?evaluation a :Cl_Evaluation .
  ?evaluation :evaluator ?doctor .
  ?employee :evaluatedBy ?evaluation .
  ?evaluation :evaluationStatement ?evaluationStatement .
}
