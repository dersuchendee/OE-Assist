**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to retrieve evaluation statements given by a doctor for a specific employee. The ontology includes classes and properties related to evaluation statements, doctors, and employees, but there is no instance data or specific relationships that connect these entities in a way that would allow for the retrieval of such information.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists all evaluation statements and their associated doctors and employees, if any:

```sparql
SELECT ?evaluationStatement ?doctor ?employee ?evaluationText
WHERE {
  ?evaluationStatement a :Cl_EvaluationStatement .
  OPTIONAL { ?evaluationStatement :givenBy ?doctor . }
  OPTIONAL { ?evaluationStatement :givenTo ?employee . }
  OPTIONAL { ?evaluationStatement :evaluationText ?evaluationText . }
}
```
