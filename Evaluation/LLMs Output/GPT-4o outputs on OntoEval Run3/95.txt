**No**

The ontology provided does not contain any direct information about the specific dates when theatre festivals took place. The ontology includes classes and properties related to theatre festivals, occurrences, and dates, but it does not provide specific instances or data that would allow us to answer the competency question directly. Therefore, we can only extract a partial answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?occurrenceDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :occurrenceDate ?occurrenceDate .
}
```
