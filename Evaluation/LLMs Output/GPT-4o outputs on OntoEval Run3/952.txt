The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate books and CDs to their constituent articles through the `ns1:hasArticle` property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?collection ?collectionLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?collection a ns1:ArticleCollection .
  OPTIONAL { ?collection rdfs:label ?collectionLabel . }

  ?collection ns1:hasArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?collection
```

This query retrieves all article collections (books or CDs) and their associated articles, along with optional labels for better readability.
