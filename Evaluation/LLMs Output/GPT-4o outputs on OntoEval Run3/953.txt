The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate books and CDs to the articles they contain. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?collection ?article
WHERE {
  ?collection a :ArticleCollection .
  ?collection :contains ?article .
  FILTER(?collection = <specific_book_or_cd_uri>)
}
```

Replace `<specific_book_or_cd_uri>` with the URI of the specific book or CD you are interested in. This query retrieves all articles contained in the specified book or CD.
