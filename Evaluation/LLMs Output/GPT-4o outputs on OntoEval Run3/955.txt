**No**

The ontology provided does not have a direct way to relate a specific book or CD to the articles it is composed of. The ontology defines classes for `Book`, `CD`, `Article`, and `ArticleCollection`, but it does not provide a direct property to link a specific book or CD to the articles it contains. The `hasMember` property relates a collection to its members, but it is not specific to books or CDs.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, which lists the articles that are members of any article collection:

```sparql
SELECT ?collection ?article
WHERE {
  ?collection a :ArticleCollection .
  ?collection :hasMember ?article .
  ?article a :Article .
}
```
