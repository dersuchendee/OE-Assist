**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine which specific articles a book or CD is composed of. The ontology includes classes and properties related to articles, article collections, and media, but it does not explicitly connect a specific book or CD to the articles it contains. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by identifying article collections and their articles, but not directly linking them to a specific book or CD.

```sparql
SELECT ?articleCollection ?article
WHERE {
  ?articleCollection a :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  ?articleCollection :containsArticle ?article .
}
```
