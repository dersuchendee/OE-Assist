The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_BookOrCD` and the object property `composedOf` which relates a `Cl_BookOrCD` to a `Cl_Article` through the intermediary class `Cl_Composition`. This allows us to query for articles that are part of a specific book or CD.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?article
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_BookOrCD .
  ?bookOrCD :composedOf ?composition .
  ?composition a :Cl_Composition .
  ?composition :composedOf ?article .
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
}
```
