**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to associate a festival with a specific location through a property or class that connects them. The `tookPlaceIn` property connects `Cl_FestivalOccurrence` to `Cl_City`, but there is no direct connection from `Cl_Festival` to `Cl_FestivalOccurrence` in the ontology. Therefore, we cannot directly answer the CQ with the given ontology.

Partial answer:
```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_Festival .
  ?occurrence a :Cl_FestivalOccurrence ;
              :tookPlaceIn ?city .
}
```
