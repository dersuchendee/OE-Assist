The competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for `Cl_Book`, `Cl_CD`, and `Cl_Article`, and an object property `:composedOf` that relates a `Cl_Publication` (which includes both `Cl_Book` and `Cl_CD` as subclasses) to `Cl_Article`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the articles that a specific book or CD is composed of.

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?publicationTitle ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication .
  ?publication :publicationTitle ?publicationTitle .
  ?publication :composedOf ?article .
  ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
}
```
