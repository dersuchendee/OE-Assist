**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine which specific articles a book or CD is composed of. The ontology includes a class `Cl_ArticleCollection` which is a subclass of both `Cl_Book` and `Cl_CD`, and it has an object property `containsArticle` that links to `Cl_Article`. However, the competency question asks for a specific book or CD, and the ontology does not provide a way to distinguish between different books or CDs or to identify a specific one.

Partial SPARQL query to extract articles contained in any article collection:

```sparql
SELECT ?articleCollection ?article
WHERE {
  ?articleCollection a :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  ?articleCollection :containsArticle ?article .
}
```
