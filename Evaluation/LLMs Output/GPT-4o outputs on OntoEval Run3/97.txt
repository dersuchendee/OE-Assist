The competency question "Where did a certain festival take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `TheatreFestival` with the object property `tookPlaceIn` that relates a festival to a `City`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  ?festival :tookPlaceIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}
