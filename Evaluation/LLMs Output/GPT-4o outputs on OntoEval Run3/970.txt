The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine which articles a specific book or CD is composed of. However, we can extract partial information about articles contained in books or CDs.

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?article
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a [owl:unionOf(:Cl_Book :Cl_CD)] .
  ?bookOrCD :containsArticle ?article .
}
```
