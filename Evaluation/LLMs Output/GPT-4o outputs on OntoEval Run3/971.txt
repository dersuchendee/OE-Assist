The ontology does not provide a direct way to determine which articles a specific book or CD is composed of. The ontology includes a `containsArticle` property that relates books and CDs to content, but it does not specify how to query for specific articles within a book or CD. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, listing books or CDs and their associated content:

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?content
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_Book, :Cl_CD .
  ?bookOrCD :containsArticle ?content .
}
```
