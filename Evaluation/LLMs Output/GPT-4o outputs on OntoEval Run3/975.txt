The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `ns1:Book` class and the `ns1:hasTotalPages` datatype property, which indicates the total number of pages in a book. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the number of pages for a specific book.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?bookLabel ?totalPages
WHERE {
  ?book a ns1:Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?book rdfs:label ?bookLabel . }
  ?book ns1:hasTotalPages ?totalPages .
}
```
