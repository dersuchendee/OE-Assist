**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the number of pages a book contains. The ontology includes a `pageNumber` datatype property for the `Book` class, but there is no instance data or specific book mentioned in the ontology to query against. Therefore, a partial answer can be extracted by querying for books and their page numbers, but it will not provide the specific answer for a particular book without instance data.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?pageNumber
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book .
  ?book :pageNumber ?pageNumber .
}
```
