The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a class `:Book` with a datatype property `:pageCount` that specifies the number of pages in a book. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the number of pages for a particular book.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book .
  ?book :pageCount ?pageCount .
}
```
