**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the number of pages for a particular book. The ontology includes a `numberOfPages` property for the `Cl_Book` class, but there is no direct connection between a specific book and its number of pages. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?book :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages . }
}
```
