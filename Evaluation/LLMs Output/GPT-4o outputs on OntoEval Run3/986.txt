The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Book` with a datatype property `pageCount` that specifies the number of pages a book contains. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?bookLabel ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book rdfs:label ?bookLabel .
  ?book :pageCount ?pageCount .
}
```
