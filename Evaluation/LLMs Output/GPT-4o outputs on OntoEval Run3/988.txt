The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes a class `Cl_Book` with a datatype property `numberOfPages` that can be used to retrieve the number of pages for a book.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the number of pages for a particular book:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages .
}
```
