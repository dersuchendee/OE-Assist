**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the location of a specific festival. The `tookPlaceIn` property is used to associate a festival with a city, but there is no direct connection between a specific festival instance and its location in the ontology. Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a ns1:TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival ns1:tookPlaceIn ?city . }
}
```
