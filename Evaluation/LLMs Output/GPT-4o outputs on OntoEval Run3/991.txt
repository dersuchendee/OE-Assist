**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct way to query the number of pages a particular book contains. However, we can extract partial information about books and their page counts if available.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?book :hasPageCount ?pageCount . }
}
```
