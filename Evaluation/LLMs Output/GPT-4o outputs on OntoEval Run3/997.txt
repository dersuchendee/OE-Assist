The competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes for books and CDs, as well as a class for publication events with a publication date. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the publication date for a specific book or CD:

```sparql
SELECT ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?publicationEvent a :Cl_PublicationEvent ;
                    :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_Book, :Cl_CD ;
            :hasPublicationEvent ?publicationEvent .
  FILTER (?bookOrCD = :bookNursePracticesInCancerPatientCare || ?bookOrCD = :cdNursePracticesInCancerPatientCare)
}
```

This query retrieves the publication date for the book or CD titled "Nurse practices in cancer patient care â€“ longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals" by checking the `:hasPublicationEvent` property and filtering for the specific book or CD individuals.
