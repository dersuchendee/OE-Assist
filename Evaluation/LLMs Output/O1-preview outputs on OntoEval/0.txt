**Answer: Yes**.

The competency question "Which is the subject of a source?" can be answered since it is a Reification CQ. The classes involved, `Cl_Source` and `Cl_Subject`, are connected through the reified class `Cl_SourceSubject` in the ontology. This allows us to retrieve the subjects associated with each source via the reification properties.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?source ?subject
WHERE {
  ?source a :Cl_Source .
  ?source :op_hasSourceSubject ?sourceSubject .
  ?sourceSubject :op_subjectOf ?subject .
}
```
