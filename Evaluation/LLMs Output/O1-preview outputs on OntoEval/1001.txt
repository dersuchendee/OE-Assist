This query retrieves all publications that are either books or CDs and selects their titles and publication dates. The ontology defines both `:Book` and `:CD` classes as subclasses of `:Publication` and associates them with the `:publicationDate` property. Therefore, the competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" is supported by the ontology, and we can extract the answer using this SPARQL query.
