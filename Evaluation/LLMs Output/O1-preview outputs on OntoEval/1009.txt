**Yes**

The ontology includes classes `:Cl_Book` and `:Cl_CD`, both associated with the datatype property `:publicationDate`. Since instances of these classes (e.g., `:Book_Nurse_Practices`) have publication dates recorded, we can write a SPARQL query to answer the competency question.

```sparql
SELECT ?bookOrCD ?bookOrCDLabel ?publicationDate
WHERE {
   ?bookOrCD a ?type .
   FILTER (?type = :Cl_Book || ?type = :Cl_CD) .
   OPTIONAL { ?bookOrCD rdfs:label ?bookOrCDLabel . }
   ?bookOrCD :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```
