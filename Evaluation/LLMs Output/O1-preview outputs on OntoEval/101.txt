The competency question "Where did a certain festival take place?" is answerable using the ontology provided. The ontology models the necessary relationships between festivals, their occurrences, and the cities where they take place.

Here is the SPARQL query to retrieve the city where a given festival took place:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalName . }

  ?festival :hasFestivalOccurrence ?occurrence .

  ?city :cityHasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityName . }
}
```

This query selects festivals and their associated cities by traversing from the `:Cl_TheatreFestival` instances to their `:hasFestivalOccurrence`, and then finding the `:Cl_City` instances that have those occurrences via the `:cityHasOccurrence` property.
