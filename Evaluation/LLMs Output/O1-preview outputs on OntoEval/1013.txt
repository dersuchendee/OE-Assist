Answer: **Yes**.

The competency question is answerable because the ontology includes the classes `:Cl_Book` and `:Cl_CD`, and the data property `:publicationDate` that applies to both. Here is the SPARQL query to retrieve the publication date of a specific book or CD:

```sparql
SELECT ?item ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?item a ?type .
  FILTER (?type = :Cl_Book || ?type = :Cl_CD) .
  ?item :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```

This query selects items that are instances of either `:Cl_Book` or `:Cl_CD` and retrieves their associated `:publicationDate`.
