**Answer: Yes**

The ontology includes classes for books and CDs (`:Cl_Book` and `:Cl_CD`), both of which are subclasses of `:Cl_Publication`. The data property `:publicationDate` has domain `:Cl_Publication`, which means it can be used to store the publication date of any publication, including books and CDs.

Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the publication date of books and CDs from the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  { ?publication a :Cl_Book } UNION { ?publication a :Cl_CD } .
  ?publication :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Cl_Book` and `:Cl_CD` and retrieves their associated publication dates using the `:publicationDate` property.

If there is a property for the title of the publication (e.g., `rdfs:label` or `:title`), you can include it in the query to identify a specific book or CD:

```sparql
SELECT ?publication ?title ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  { ?publication a :Cl_Book } UNION { ?publication a :Cl_CD } .
  ?publication :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?publication rdfs:label ?title . }
}
```

This extended query will retrieve the titles along with the publication dates, allowing you to find out when a certain book or CD was published.
