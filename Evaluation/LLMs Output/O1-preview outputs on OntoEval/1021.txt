Answer: **Yes**

The Competency Question "When did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology contains information about seminars, specifically instances of seminars with their associated dates through the property `ns1:hasDate`.

Here is the SPARQL query to retrieve the date of seminars:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a ns1:Seminar .
  ?seminar ns1:hasDate ?date .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves all seminars along with their labels and the dates they took place. If you're interested in a specific seminar, for example, "Seminar on New Articles," you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?date
WHERE {
  ns1:SeminarOnNewArticles a ns1:Seminar .
  ns1:SeminarOnNewArticles ns1:hasDate ?date .
}
```

This will provide the date when the specified seminar took place.
