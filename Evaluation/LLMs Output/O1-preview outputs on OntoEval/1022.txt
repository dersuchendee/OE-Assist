**Yes**

The competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" is answerable using the given ontology. The ontology includes the `:Seminar` class and the `:hasDate` datatype property, which allows us to retrieve the date on which a seminar took place. Additionally, we can use properties like `:hasSeminarTitle` or `:takesPlaceAt` to specify the particular seminar we are interested in.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the date of a specific seminar based on its title:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/seminararticles#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasDate ?date .
  ?seminar :hasSeminarTitle "Seminar on New Articles at Ospedale Riunito delle Tre Valli" .
}
```

If you want to find the date of the seminar based on its location, you can use the following query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/seminar#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasDate ?date .
  ?seminar :takesPlaceAt ?location .
  ?location a :Hospital .
  ?location rdfs:label "Ospedale Riunito delle Tre Valli" .
}
```

These queries utilize the ontology's classes and properties to retrieve the date of a specific seminar, thereby confirming that the competency question is supported by the ontology.
