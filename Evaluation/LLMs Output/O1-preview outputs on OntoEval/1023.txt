**Yes**.

The ontology provides sufficient information to answer the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" The classes and properties in the ontology allow us to retrieve seminars and their dates.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the dates of seminars:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminarEvent rdf:type :Cl_SeminarOccurrence .
  ?seminarEvent :relatesToSeminar ?seminar .
  ?seminarEvent :hasDate ?date .
}
```

This query selects seminars and their associated dates by navigating through the `:Cl_SeminarOccurrence` class, which is linked to the seminar via the `:relatesToSeminar` property and has a date specified by the `:hasDate` property.
