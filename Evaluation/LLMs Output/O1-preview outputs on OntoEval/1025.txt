The Competency Question (CQ) "When did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines the classes and properties necessary to retrieve the date of a seminar.

Here's the SPARQL query to extract the seminar dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar rdf:type :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :startDate ?startDate .
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of `:Cl_Seminar` and their associated `:startDate`, effectively answering when each seminar took place.
