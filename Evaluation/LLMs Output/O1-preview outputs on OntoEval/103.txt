SELECT ?festivalName ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?festival rdf:type :Cl_Festival ;
            :name ?festivalName ;
            :hasLocation ?city .
  FILTER(?festivalName = "Roma Loves Shakespeare") .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityName . }
}
```

This SPARQL query retrieves the city where the festival named "Roma Loves Shakespeare" took place by querying the `:hasLocation` property of the `:Cl_Festival` class in the ontology. Under the closed world assumption, since the ontology defines the necessary classes and properties to relate a festival to its location, the competency question is answerable.
