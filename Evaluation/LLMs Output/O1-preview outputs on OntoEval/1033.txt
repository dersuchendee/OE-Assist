The ontology contains the class `:Cl_Seminar` with the data property `:seminarDate` associated with it. There is an individual `:Seminar_December_2008` of type `:Cl_Seminar`, with a `:seminarDate` value specified. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the date of seminars.

Here is the SPARQL query to retrieve the dates of seminars:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar rdf:type :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?date .
}
```

This query will return all seminars and their dates. If available, it will also include any labels associated with the seminars.
