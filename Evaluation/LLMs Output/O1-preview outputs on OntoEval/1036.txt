The CQ "When did a certain seminar take place?" is supported by the ontology because it includes a class `:Cl_Seminar` and a data property `:seminarDate` associated with it. This allows us to query for seminars and their dates.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the date of seminars:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?date .
}
```
