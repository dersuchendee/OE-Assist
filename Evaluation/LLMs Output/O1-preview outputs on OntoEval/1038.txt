The competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" is answerable with the given ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_Seminar` and the data property `:seminarDate`, which has `:Cl_Seminar` as its domain and `xsd:date` as its range. This allows us to retrieve the dates of seminars.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the seminar dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?date .
}
```
