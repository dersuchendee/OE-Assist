The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to answer the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?". Specifically, the ontology includes the class `:Cl_Seminar` and the data property `:seminarDate` with domain `:Cl_Seminar` and range `xsd:date`. This allows us to query for seminars and their associated dates.

Here's the SPARQL query to retrieve the dates of seminars:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar rdf:type :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?date .
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Cl_Seminar` and retrieves their `:seminarDate` values.
