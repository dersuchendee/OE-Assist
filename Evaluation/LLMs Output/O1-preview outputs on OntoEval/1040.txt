Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_Seminar` and the datatype property `:seminarDate`, which allows us to retrieve the date of a seminar.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the information:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?date .
}
```

This query selects all instances of seminars (`?seminar`) along with their associated dates (`?date`).
