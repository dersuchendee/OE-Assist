The given CQ is "What articles were presented in a certain seminar?"

This CQ is answerable by the ontology using the classes and properties provided. Specifically, the ontology connects seminars to articles through the `:Cl_ArticlePresentation` class, which links `:Cl_Seminar` and `:Cl_Article` via the `:hasSeminar` and `:hasArticle` object properties, respectively.

Here's the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
    ?presentation a :Cl_ArticlePresentation .
    ?presentation :hasSeminar :SpecificSeminar .
    ?presentation :hasArticle ?article .
    OPTIONAL { ?article :hasTitle ?articleTitle . }
}
```

Replace `:SpecificSeminar` with the actual seminar URI you're interested in. This query retrieves all articles (`?article`) that are associated with the given seminar via presentations, along with their titles (`?articleTitle`) if available.
