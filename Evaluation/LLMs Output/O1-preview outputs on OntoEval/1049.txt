The CQ is answerable because the ontology includes classes and properties that relate articles to seminar presentations and seminars. Specifically, we have:

- `:Cl_Article` class representing articles.
- `:Cl_Seminar` class representing seminars.
- `:Cl_SeminarPresentation` class representing presentations in seminars.
- Properties connecting these classes:
  - `:presentedIn` links an article to a seminar presentation.
  - `:presentationInSeminar` links a seminar presentation to a seminar.

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve the articles presented in a specific seminar:

```sparql
SELECT ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  # Replace :SpecificSeminar with the URI of the seminar of interest
  VALUES ?seminar { :SpecificSeminar }
  
  ?seminar :hasPresentation ?presentation .
  ?presentation :presentationOfArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle . }
}
```

Replace `:SpecificSeminar` with the identifier of the seminar you're interested in. This query retrieves all articles presented in that seminar, along with their titles if available.
