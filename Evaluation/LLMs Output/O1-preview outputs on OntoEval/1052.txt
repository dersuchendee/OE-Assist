Answer: **Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?article rdf:type :Cl_Article .
  ?article :presentedIn ?presentation .
  ?presentation :presentationOf ?seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle . }
  FILTER(?seminar = :SeminarOnNursePractices)
}
```

This query retrieves all articles that were presented in a specific seminar (in this case, `:SeminarOnNursePractices`). It uses the ontology's classes and properties to navigate from articles to their presentations and the seminars where they were presented.
