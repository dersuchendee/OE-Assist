The ontology provides the necessary information to answer the competency question: "What articles were presented in a certain seminar?". The class `:Cl_Seminar` is connected to `:Cl_Article` through the property `:presentedArticle`. Therefore, we can retrieve the articles presented at seminars using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar rdf:type :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
  
  ?seminar :presentedArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
```

If you're interested in a specific seminar (e.g., `:Seminar_2008`), you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  :Seminar_2008 :presentedArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
```

This query will return all articles that were presented at the specified seminar.
