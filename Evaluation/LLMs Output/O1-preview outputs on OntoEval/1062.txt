The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to answer the competency question "What articles were presented in a certain seminar?". Specifically, it includes:

- Class `:Cl_Article` representing articles.
- Class `:Cl_Seminar` representing seminars.
- Object properties `:presentedIn` and `:hasArticle` linking articles to seminars.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the articles presented in each seminar:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
```

This query selects all seminars and their associated articles, retrieving optional labels for better readability.
