```sparql
SELECT ?article ?articleTitle ?seminar ?seminarTitle
WHERE {
  ?article rdf:type :Cl_Article .
  ?article :presentedIn ?seminarPresentation .
  ?seminarPresentation rdf:type :Cl_SeminarPresentation .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleTitle . }
  OPTIONAL { ?seminarPresentation rdfs:label ?seminarTitle . }
}
```

In this query, we retrieve all articles and their titles that were presented in seminars. The `:presentedIn` property connects `:Cl_Article` to `:Cl_SeminarPresentation`, which is a reified class combining both `:Cl_Seminar` and `:Cl_Article`. This allows us to answer the competency question by navigating through the ontology's structure.
