**Yes**

Because the ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to answer the competency question. Specifically, it includes the class `:Seminar`, an instance `:SeminarOnNewArticles` of that class, and the property `:hasLocation` that links seminars to their locations (which are of type `:City`). Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the location of a seminar.

```sparql
SELECT ?seminarLabel ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
  ?seminar :hasLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves seminars and their locations. If you want to find the location of a specific seminar, for example, "Seminar on New Articles", you can use the following query:

```sparql
SELECT ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  :SeminarOnNewArticles :hasLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}
```
