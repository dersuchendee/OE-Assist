The competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology contains information about seminars, the hospitals where they take place, and the locations of those hospitals.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the seminar and its location:

```sparql
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a ns1:Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
  
  ?seminar ns1:takesPlaceAt ?hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
  
  OPTIONAL {
    ?hospital ns1:locatedIn ?city .
    OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
    
    OPTIONAL {
      ?city ns1:isLocatedIn ?country .
      OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return the seminar (`?seminar`), its label (`?seminarLabel`), the hospital where it took place (`?hospital`), the hospital's label (`?hospitalLabel`), the city (`?city`), the city's label (`?cityLabel`), the country (`?country`), and the country's label (`?countryLabel`).

**Explanation:**

- **Seminar Retrieval**: The query starts by selecting instances of `ns1:Seminar`.
- **Label Retrieval**: The `OPTIONAL` clauses are used to fetch labels if they are available.
- **Location Association**:
  - The `ns1:takesPlaceAt` property associates the seminar with a hospital.
  - The `ns1:locatedIn` property associates the hospital with a city.
  - The `ns1:isLocatedIn` property associates the city with a country.
- **Hierarchical Location**: By traversing from the seminar to the hospital, then to the city, and finally to the country, we extract the full location information.

**Result:**

Using this query on the provided ontology will yield that the seminar took place at **Ospedale Riunito delle Tre Valli** in **Nocera Inferiore**, **Italy**, which aligns with the information given in the ontology and the ontological story.
