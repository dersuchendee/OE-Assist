**Answer: Yes**

The competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology defines classes and properties that allow us to retrieve the location of seminars.

In the ontology, seminars are represented by the class `:Cl_Seminar`, and seminar occurrences by `:Cl_SeminarOccurrence`, which is a subclass of `:Cl_Event`. The property `:relatesToSeminar` connects a seminar occurrence to a seminar, and `:tookPlaceAt` connects a seminar occurrence to a location (`:Cl_Location`). Hospitals (`:Cl_Hospital`) are subclasses of locations.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve seminars and their locations:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
    ?seminarOccurrence a :Cl_SeminarOccurrence .
    ?seminarOccurrence :relatesToSeminar ?seminar .
    OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel }

    ?seminarOccurrence :tookPlaceAt ?location .
    OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel }
}
```

This query selects the seminar and its associated location by traversing the relationships defined in the ontology. It starts from the seminar occurrence, links it to the seminar via `:relatesToSeminar`, and then finds the location where it took place using `:tookPlaceAt`. The `OPTIONAL` clauses include any labels if they are available.
