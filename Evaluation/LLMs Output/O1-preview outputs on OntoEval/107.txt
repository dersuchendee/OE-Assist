**Answer: Yes**

The competency question "Where did a certain festival take place?" is answerable using the given ontology. The ontology models festivals, their occurrences, and the locations where they take place. Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the locations of festivals:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival rdf:type :Cl_Festival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :takesPlaceIn ?city .
}
```

This query selects festivals and the cities where their occurrences take place by navigating through the `:hasOccurrence` and `:takesPlaceIn` object properties defined in the ontology.
