**Answer: Yes**

The competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes concepts such as `Seminar`, `Event`, `Place`, `takesPlaceAt`, and `isLocatedIn`, which allow us to model seminars and their locations.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?place ?placeLabel
WHERE {
    ?seminar a :Seminar .
    OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
    ?seminar :takesPlaceAt ?place .
    OPTIONAL { ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves seminars and the places where they took place by utilizing the `takesPlaceAt` object property defined in the ontology.
