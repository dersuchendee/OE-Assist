**Answer: Yes**

The competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" is answerable using the provided ontology. We can construct a SPARQL query to extract the location where seminars took place. Here's the SPARQL query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?hospital ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate . }
  ?seminar :takesPlaceAt ?hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital :locatedIn ?city . }
  OPTIONAL { ?city :isLocatedIn ?country . }
}
```

This query retrieves seminars and their locations by navigating through the relationships defined in the ontology:

- `?seminar a :Cl_Seminar`: Finds individuals of type `Cl_Seminar`.
- `?seminar :takesPlaceAt ?hospital`: Retrieves the hospital where the seminar took place.
- `?hospital :locatedIn ?city`: Retrieves the city where the hospital is located.
- `?city :isLocatedIn ?country`: Retrieves the country where the city is located.

By executing this query on the ontology, we can obtain the location details of the seminars, thus answering the competency question.
