**Yes**

The ontology models that every seminar has at least one article presented. This is established through the class restrictions defined in the ontology:

- **Cl_Seminar** is equivalent to the class that has at least one **:hasPresentationEvent** to **Cl_PresentationEvent**.
- **Cl_PresentationEvent** is equivalent to the class that has at least one **:presentationOfArticle** to **Cl_Article**.

These restrictions ensure that for every instance of **Cl_Seminar**, there must be at least one associated **Cl_PresentationEvent** which, in turn, must be linked to at least one **Cl_Article**. Therefore, the competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve each seminar and the articles presented at them:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar rdf:type :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentationEvent ?presentationEvent .
  ?presentationEvent :presentationOfArticle ?article .
}
```

This query will return all seminars along with the articles presented at each seminar, demonstrating that every seminar has at least one article presented, as modeled by the ontology.
