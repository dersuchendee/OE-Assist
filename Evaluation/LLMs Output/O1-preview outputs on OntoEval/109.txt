**Answer:** **Yes**

**Explanation:**

The Competency Question (CQ) is "Where did a certain festival take place?" We need to determine if this CQ can be answered using the provided ontology.

**Analysis:**

- The ontology includes the class `:Cl_TheatreFestival` representing festivals.
- There is a class `:Cl_City` representing cities.
- The object property `:tookPlaceIn` connects festivals to cities, with domain `:Cl_TheatreFestival` and range `:Cl_City`.
- An individual festival `:RomaLovesShakespeare` is defined, which is an instance of `:Cl_TheatreFestival` and is connected via `:tookPlaceIn` to the city `:Rome`.

Since the ontology contains the necessary classes, properties, and individuals to answer the question, the CQ is supported.

**SPARQL Query:**

To retrieve the city where a specific festival took place, you can use the following SPARQL query. Replace `:RomaLovesShakespeare` with the URI of the festival you're interested in.

```sparql
SELECT ?city
WHERE {
    :RomaLovesShakespeare :tookPlaceIn ?city .
}
```

To retrieve all festivals and their locations, you can use:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
    ?festival rdf:type :Cl_TheatreFestival .
    ?festival :tookPlaceIn ?city .
}
```

**Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?city
WHERE {
    ?festival rdf:type :Cl_TheatreFestival .
    ?festival :tookPlaceIn ?city .
}
```
