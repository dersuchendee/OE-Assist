**Yes**

The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar." is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology specifies that every instance of `:Seminar` is constrained to have at least one `:presents` relationship to an instance of `:Article` through the following axiom:

```ttl
:Seminar rdfs:subClassOf [
    a owl:Restriction ;
    owl:onProperty :presents ;
    owl:minCardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger
] .
```

This constraint ensures that every seminar must present at least one article.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves all seminars along with the number of articles they present:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar (COUNT(?article) AS ?numArticles)
WHERE {
    ?seminar a :Seminar .
    ?seminar :presents ?article .
}
GROUP BY ?seminar
```

This query will list all seminars and confirm that each seminar has at least one associated article, satisfying the competency question.
