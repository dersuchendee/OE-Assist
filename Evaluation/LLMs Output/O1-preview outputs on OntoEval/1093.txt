**Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology models that each `:Seminar` must have at least one `:hasPresentedArticle` relationship to an `:Article`. This is enforced through the `owl:minQualifiedCardinality` restriction in the ontology:

```ttl
:Seminar rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :Event ,
        [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
          owl:onProperty :hasPresentedArticle ;
          owl:minQualifiedCardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
          owl:onClass :Article
        ] .
```

This restriction ensures that any instance of `:Seminar` will have at least one associated `:Article` presented.

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve all seminars and their presented articles:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar rdf:type :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentedArticle ?article .
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Seminar` and their associated `:Article` instances presented at each seminar, confirming that every seminar has at least one article.
