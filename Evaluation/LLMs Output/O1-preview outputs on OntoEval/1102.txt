Answer: **Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the ontology. We can verify that every seminar has at least one article presented using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?sap a :Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation ;
         :presentedIn ?seminar ;
         :articlePresented ?article .
  }
}
```

If this query returns no results, it means there are no seminars without articles presented, confirming that at least one article is always presented at each seminar.

Alternatively, to retrieve all seminars along with the articles presented in them, you can use:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?sap a :Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation ;
       :presentedIn ?seminar ;
       :articlePresented ?article .
}
```

This query lists all seminars and the articles presented at each, demonstrating that each seminar has at least one article.
