**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology. The ontology models the concept that at least one article is always presented at each seminar through the `owl:Restriction` on the `:Cl_Seminar` class, specifying a minimum cardinality of 1 on the `:presentedIn` property.

Here is the SPARQL query to retrieve all seminars and their presented articles:

```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar rdf:type :Cl_Seminar .
  ?article rdf:type :Cl_SeminarArticle .
  ?article :presentedIn ?seminar .
}
```

This query selects all seminars and the articles presented in them, ensuring that each seminar has at least one article associated with it, as modeled in the ontology.
