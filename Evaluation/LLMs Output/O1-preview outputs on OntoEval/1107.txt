The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is modeled in the ontology. The ontology defines the class `:Cl_Seminar` as a subclass of a restriction that specifies a minimum cardinality of 1 on the property `:hasPresentedArticle`. This means that every instance of `:Cl_Seminar` must be associated with at least one article via the `:hasPresentedArticle` property.

The provided SPARQL query retrieves classes that are subclasses of a restriction enforcing that they have at least one `:hasPresentedArticle` property, confirming that the ontology models the competency question.
