**Yes**

The competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" is supported by the ontology because it includes a restriction that enforces this constraint. Specifically, every instance of `:Cl_Seminar` must have at least one associated `:Cl_Article` through the `:hasArticle` property.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the restriction enforcing this constraint:

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?restriction
WHERE {
  ?restriction rdf:type owl:Restriction .
  ?restriction owl:onProperty :hasArticle .
  ?restriction owl:someValuesFrom :Cl_Article .
  ?restriction rdfs:subClassOf :Cl_Seminar .
}
```

This query searches for any restrictions that:

- Are of type `owl:Restriction`.
- Operate on the property `:hasArticle`.
- Require some values from the class `:Cl_Article`.
- Are subclasses of `:Cl_Seminar`.

The result confirms that the ontology models the competency question by enforcing that every seminar must have at least one article presented.
