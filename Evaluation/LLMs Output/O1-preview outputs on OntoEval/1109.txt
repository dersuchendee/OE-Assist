Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve seminars and the articles presented in each seminar:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
    ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
    ?seminar :presentedIn ?article .
    ?article a :Cl_Article .
}
```

**Explanation:**

The ontology includes the following restriction:

```ttl
:Cl_Seminar owl:equivalentClass [
    rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
    owl:onProperty :presentedIn ;
    owl:someValuesFrom :Cl_Article
] .
```

This means that every instance of `:Cl_Seminar` must have at least one `:presentedIn` relationship to an instance of `:Cl_Article`. This models the competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar."

Despite some confusion in the ontology regarding the direction of the `:presentedIn` property, for the competency question to be answerable, we assume that `:presentedIn` is an object property from `:Cl_Seminar` to `:Cl_Article`. This aligns with the restriction and allows us to retrieve the required information using the SPARQL query provided.
