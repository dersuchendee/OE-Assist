**No**

Because the ontology lacks the necessary data properties to retrieve the specific time and day of the event. The classes `:Cl_TimeInterval` and `:Cl_DayOfWeek` are defined, but there are no data properties connecting these classes to actual time values or day names. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question.

Here's a partial SPARQL query that retrieves the events along with their time intervals and days of the week if available:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?event ?timeInterval ?dayOfWeek
WHERE {
  ?event a :Cl_BathroomEvent .
  OPTIONAL { ?event :op_hasTime ?timeInterval . }
  OPTIONAL { ?event :op_hasDayOfWeek ?dayOfWeek . }
}
```

This query will list all instances of `:Cl_BathroomEvent` along with their associated `:Cl_TimeInterval` and `:Cl_DayOfWeek` if such associations exist in the data. However, without data properties that provide the actual time and day values, we cannot extract the specific time and day when the event occurred.
