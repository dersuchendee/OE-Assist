Answer: **Yes**
Here the CQ is answerable because the ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to retrieve the user's location. The `Cl_User` class is connected to `Cl_Location` through the `hasLocation` property, and `Cl_Location` has a `locatedIn` data property that gives the location name.

```sparql
SELECT ?user ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?user a :Cl_User .
  ?user :hasLocation ?location .
  ?location :locatedIn ?locationName .
}
```
