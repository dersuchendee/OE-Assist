Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "What are the attributes of this weather service?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology defines a `:Cl_WeatherService` class with properties such as `:hasURL`, `:hasLocation`, and `:hasPrognosis`. The specific instance `:YrNoWeatherService` is linked to instances of `:Cl_Location` and `:Cl_Prognosis`, which have their own attributes. We can construct a SPARQL query to retrieve all relevant attributes of `:YrNoWeatherService`.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the attributes:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?url ?cityName ?prognosisDuration
WHERE {
  :YrNoWeatherService :hasURL ?url .
  
  :YrNoWeatherService :hasLocation ?location .
  ?location :hasCityName ?cityName .
  
  :YrNoWeatherService :hasPrognosis ?prognosis .
  ?prognosis :hasDuration ?prognosisDuration .
}
```

This query will return the URL, the city name associated with the location, and the duration of the prognosis for `:YrNoWeatherService`. It effectively retrieves the attributes defined in the ontology for the specified weather service.
