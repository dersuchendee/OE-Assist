Answer: **Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?attributeLabel ?value
WHERE {
  :YrNoWeatherService ?property ?value .
  FILTER (?property != rdf:type)
  OPTIONAL { ?property rdfs:label ?attributeLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves all the attributes of the `:YrNoWeatherService`, excluding its type declaration, along with the labels of those attributes for better readability. It will provide information such as the service's name and the locations it provides forecasts for.
