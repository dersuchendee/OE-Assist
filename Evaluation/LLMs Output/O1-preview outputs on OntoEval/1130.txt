Answer: **No**

The Competency Question cannot be fully answered by this ontology because there's no explicit link between the user's weather service preference and the weather service itself. Specifically, there's no property connecting `:UserWeatherServicePreferenceBerlin` or `:UserPreferenceBerlin` to `:WeatherServiceYrNo`. Therefore, we cannot retrieve all the attribute values for the weather service used to derive the personalized weather information for this user.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer, retrieving the user's preference details:

```sparql
SELECT ?location ?prognosisDuration
WHERE {
  :UserWeatherServicePreferenceBerlin
    :hasLocation ?location ;
    :hasPrognosis ?prognosis .
  ?prognosis :hasDuration ?prognosisDuration .
}
```

This query retrieves the location and prognosis duration associated with the user's weather service preference but does not include the weather service URL or other attributes due to the missing connections in the ontology.
