  ?festival :locationName ?locationName .

```

The competency question "Where did a certain festival take place?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines festivals as instances of `:Cl_TheatreFestival` and their locations through the `:Cl_FestivalLocation` class, which is a subclass of both `:Cl_TheatreFestival` and `:Cl_City`. The data property `:locationName` is associated with `:Cl_FestivalLocation` and provides the name of the location.

In the SPARQL query above, we select all festivals (`?festival`) that are instances of `:Cl_FestivalLocation` and retrieve their associated location names (`?locationName`) using the `:locationName` data property. This effectively answers the competency question by providing the locations where specific festivals took place.
