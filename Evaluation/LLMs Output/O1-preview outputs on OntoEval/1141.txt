The competency question "What are the preferred movie categories of the current user?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology defines a `:CurrentUser` individual of type `:User`, who has a `:hasPreference` relationship with `:ActionMovie`, an individual of type `:MovieCategory`. This allows us to retrieve the preferred movie categories of the current user using a SPARQL query.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the preferred movie categories of the current user:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/onto/movie_preferences#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?category ?categoryLabel
WHERE {
  :CurrentUser :hasPreference ?category .
  OPTIONAL { ?category rdfs:label ?categoryLabel . }
}
```

This query selects all movie categories that the `:CurrentUser` has a preference for, along with their labels if available. The query utilizes the `:hasPreference` object property defined in the ontology to find the preferred movie categories.
