The Competency Question (CQ) asks: *"What are the attributes of this event category (e.g., a movie has a genre and a set of actors)?"*

The ontology provided models the event category `:FilmEvent` and defines several attributes (properties) associated with it, such as `:hasTitle`, `:hasGenre`, `:hasStartTime`, `:hasLocation`, and `:featuresActor`. Therefore, the CQ is supported by the ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the attributes (properties) of the `:FilmEvent` class along with their labels and ranges:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?property ?propertyLabel ?range ?rangeLabel
WHERE {
  ?property rdfs:domain :FilmEvent .
  OPTIONAL { ?property rdfs:label ?propertyLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { 
    ?property rdfs:range ?range .
    OPTIONAL { ?range rdfs:label ?rangeLabel . }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The query selects all properties where `:FilmEvent` is the domain, meaning they are attributes of the `:FilmEvent` class.
- It retrieves the property IRIs (`?property`), their labels (`?propertyLabel`), their ranges (`?range`), and the range labels (`?rangeLabel`).
- The `OPTIONAL` clauses ensure that labels and range labels are included if available.

**Sample Result:**

| property             | propertyLabel   | range             | rangeLabel     |
|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| :hasTitle            | has title       | xsd:string        |                |
| :hasGenre            | has genre       | xsd:string        |                |
| :hasStartTime        | has start time  | xsd:dateTime      |                |
| :hasLocation         | has location    | :Location         | Location       |
| :featuresActor       | features actor  | :Actor            | Actor          |

This result shows the attributes of the `:FilmEvent` category, matching the example given in the CQ (e.g., a movie has a genre and a set of actors).

**Note:** If you also want to list the attributes of specific instances of `:FilmEvent`, such as `:XMenPreview`, you can modify the query to retrieve the properties and their values for that instance.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?propertyLabel ?value
WHERE {
  :XMenPreview a :FilmEvent .
  ?property rdfs:domain :FilmEvent .
  OPTIONAL { ?property rdfs:label ?propertyLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { :XMenPreview ?property ?value . }
}
```

**Sample Result for Instance `:XMenPreview`:**

| propertyLabel   | value                           |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| has title       | "X-men"                         |
| has genre       | "Action"                        |
| has start time  | "2023-04-01T20:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime |
| has location    | :CinemaOne                      |
| features actor  | _(No value provided)_           |

This instance does not have a value for `:featuresActor`, but the property is defined in the ontology, aligning with the attributes mentioned in the CQ.
