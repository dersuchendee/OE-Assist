**No**

The ontology does not contain instances of `:System` or specific energy components linked to a system. Therefore, we cannot retrieve the energy components present in a particular system as required by the competency question. However, we can extract the types of energy components defined in the ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?energyComponent ?label
WHERE {
  ?energyComponent rdfs:subClassOf* :EnergyComponent .
  FILTER(?energyComponent != :EnergyComponent)
  OPTIONAL { ?energyComponent rdfs:label ?label. }
}
```

This query retrieves all subclasses of `:EnergyComponent`, such as `:Energy`, `:Exergy`, and `:Anergy`, along with their labels. It provides information about the types of energy components defined in the ontology but does not link them to a specific system due to the absence of individual instances.
