The ontology models the competency question because it includes classes and properties that link a `Flow` to its `Quality` at specific times through `FlowQualityObservation`. This allows us to query for the quality of a flow at a specific time.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract the quality of a flow at a specific time:

```sparql
SELECT ?flow ?quality ?time
WHERE {
  ?flow a :Flow .
  ?flow :hasQualityObservation ?observation .
  ?observation :hasQuality ?quality .
  ?observation :observedAtTime ?time .
}
```
