Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "From what source does this data originate?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology defines the necessary classes and properties to model data and their sources:

- **Classes**: `:Data`, `:Source`
- **Object Property**: `:originatesFrom` (connecting `:Data` to `:Source`)

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves instances of `:Data` along with their associated `:Source`:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?data ?source
WHERE {
  ?data a :Data .
  ?data :originatesFrom ?source .
}
```

This query will return all data instances and the sources from which they originate, as modeled in the ontology.
