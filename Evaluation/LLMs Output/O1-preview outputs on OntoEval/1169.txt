**No**

The ontology provided defines the classes and their relationships but does not contain any instances (individuals) or data that represent specific external factors affecting specific processes, actors, or value networks. Under the closed world assumption, without instances of `:ExternalFactor` and `:AffectedEntity` and relationships between them via the properties `:affects` or `:isAffectedBy`, we cannot answer the competency question fully.

Here's a SPARQL query that extracts the types of external factors defined in the ontology, which serves as a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?externalFactorType ?label
WHERE {
  ?externalFactorType rdfs:subClassOf :ExternalFactor .
  OPTIONAL { ?externalFactorType rdfs:label ?label . }
}
```

This query retrieves the subclasses of `:ExternalFactor`, which are:

- `:SystemBarrier`
- `:MacroLevelEnergyInfrastructure`
- `:Legislation`

While this provides information about the types of external factors that could affect processes, actors, or value networks, it does not specify which external factors affect which specific entities, as no instances or relationships are defined in the ontology.
