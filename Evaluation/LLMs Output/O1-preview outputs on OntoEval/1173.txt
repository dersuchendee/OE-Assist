Answer: **Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the ontology, as we can retrieve the timestamp of each energy data change and its detailed breakdown through the properties defined.

```sparql
SELECT ?energyData ?timestamp ?detailedBreakdown
WHERE {
  ?energyData a :EnergyData .
  ?energyData :hasChange ?dataChange .
  ?dataChange :hasTimestamp ?timestamp .
  ?energyData :hasDetailedBreakdown ?detailedBreakdown .
}
```
