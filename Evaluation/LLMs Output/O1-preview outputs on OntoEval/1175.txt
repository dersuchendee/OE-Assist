**Yes**

You can answer the competency question with the given ontology. Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the data associated with a specific energy flow at a specific point in time:

```sparql
SELECT ?data
WHERE {
  # Replace :givenEnergyFlow and :givenTimePoint with the actual identifiers of the energy flow and time point you're interested in.
  :givenEnergyFlow a :EnergyFlow .
  :givenEnergyFlow :hasData ?data .
  :givenEnergyFlow :atTime :givenTimePoint .
}
```

This query selects the data (`?data`) associated with a particular energy flow (`:givenEnergyFlow`) at a specific time point (`:givenTimePoint`). The ontology defines that each `EnergyFlow` instance must have one `hasData` (linking to `Data`) and one `atTime` (linking to `TimePoint`), which aligns with the competency question.
