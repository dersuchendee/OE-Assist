**Yes**

The competency question "How efficient is this process?" can be answered using the ontology because the class `:Process` has a datatype property `:hasEfficiency` which represents the efficiency of the process as a float value. Additionally, processes are related to capacities through the `:hasCapacity` object property, and the specific capacity in question is `:CapacityToDevelopNewConfigurations`.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the efficiency of processes that have the capacity to develop new configurations:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?process ?efficiency
WHERE {
  ?process a :Process .
  ?process :hasEfficiency ?efficiency .
  ?process :hasCapacity ?capacity .
  ?capacity a :CapacityToDevelopNewConfigurations .
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Process` that have an associated efficiency (`:hasEfficiency`) and are linked to a capacity of type `:CapacityToDevelopNewConfigurations` via the `:hasCapacity` property. The result will provide the efficiency value for each such process, effectively answering the competency question.
