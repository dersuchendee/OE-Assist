**No**

The competency question cannot be fully answered because there are no individual instances of `:MountingSystem` or `:ExecutionTechnique` in the ontology. Without specific data about mounting systems and their possible execution techniques, we cannot extract the required information.

However, we can write a SPARQL query that would retrieve the possible execution techniques for mounting systems if such data were present:

```sparql
SELECT ?mountingSystemLabel ?executionTechniqueLabel
WHERE {
  ?mountingSystem a :MountingSystem ;
                  rdfs:label ?mountingSystemLabel ;
                  :hasPossibleExecutionTechnique ?executionTechnique .

  ?executionTechnique rdfs:label ?executionTechniqueLabel .
}
```

This query attempts to find all mounting systems (`?mountingSystem`) and their possible execution techniques (`?executionTechnique`), retrieving their labels for readability. But since there are no instances in the ontology, this query would return an empty result set.
