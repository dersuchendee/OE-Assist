Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "Where did a certain festival take place?" can be answered by the ontology because it includes the necessary classes and properties to retrieve the location of a theatre festival. Specifically, the ontology contains the class `:Cl_TheatreFestival` to represent festivals, the object property `:locatedIn` to associate a festival with its location, and the data property `:locationCity` to capture the name of the city where the festival takes place.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the locations of festivals:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?locationCity
WHERE {
  ?festival rdf:type :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :locatedIn ?festivalLocation .
  ?festivalLocation :locationCity ?locationCity .
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of `:Cl_TheatreFestival`, finds their associated `:Cl_FestivalLocation` through the `:locatedIn` property, and then gets the name of the city using the `:locationCity` data property.
