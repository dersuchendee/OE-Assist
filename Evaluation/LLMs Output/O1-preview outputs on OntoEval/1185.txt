**No**

The ontology lacks information about specific individuals, including who "she" refers to. Therefore, it cannot answer the question "Where did she perform?" under the closed world assumption.

Here's a SPARQL query that extracts a partial answer by listing locations where any female musician has performed:

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?musician ?location
WHERE {
  ?musician a :FemaleMusician .
  ?musician :hasPerformed ?performance .
  ?performance :takesPlaceAt ?location .
}
```
