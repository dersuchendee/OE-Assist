Answer: **No**

Due to the absence of connections between the theatre festival and the festival play appearances via the `:hasProduction` property, we cannot determine which plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival.

However, we can provide a partial answer by listing the plays featured in festival play appearances.

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?appearance rdf:type :Cl_FestivalPlayAppearance .
  ?appearance :featuresPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasName ?playName . }
}
```
