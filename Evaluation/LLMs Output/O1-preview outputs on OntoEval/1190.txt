Answer: **No**

Because the ontology only defines the classes `Celebration`, `Festival`, and `PrivateEvent` as subclasses of `Event` without any instances or properties to associate with specific events. Therefore, we cannot determine for a given event whether it is a celebration, a festival, or a private event.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract the types of events defined in the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?eventType ?label
WHERE {
  ?eventType rdfs:subClassOf :Event .
  OPTIONAL { ?eventType rdfs:label ?label . }
}
```

This query retrieves all subclasses of `:Event` along with their labels, providing a partial answer by listing the possible event types.
