The ontology models power relations between persons, including the patronage relationship between patrons and musicians, as well as supervision relationships. Thus, the competency question "Was there a power relation? (e.g., Patron / Musician)" is answerable using the ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves instances of power relations:

```sparql
SELECT ?person1 ?relationLabel ?person2
WHERE {
  ?person1 a :Person .
  ?person2 a :Person .
  ?person1 ?relation ?person2 .
  ?relation rdfs:subPropertyOf+ :hasPowerOver .
  OPTIONAL { ?relation rdfs:label ?relationLabel . }
}
```

This query selects pairs of individuals (`?person1`, `?person2`) connected by a property (`?relation`) that is a subproperty of `:hasPowerOver`, along with the label of the relation for readability. It will retrieve all instances where a person has some form of power over another person, such as through patronage or supervision relationships defined in the ontology.
