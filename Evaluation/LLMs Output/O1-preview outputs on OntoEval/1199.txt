**Yes**

The competency question asks for the places of origin of musicians. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to answer this question: `:Musician`, `:Place`, and the object property `:hasPlaceOfOrigin` that links musicians to their places of origin.

```sparql
SELECT ?musician ?musicianLabel ?place ?placeLabel
WHERE {
  ?musician a :Musician .
  OPTIONAL { ?musician rdfs:label ?musicianLabel . }

  ?musician :hasPlaceOfOrigin ?place .
  OPTIONAL { ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel . }
}
```
