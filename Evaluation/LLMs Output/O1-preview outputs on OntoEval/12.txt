Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "Which are the parts of an instrument?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_MusicalInstrument`, the class `:Cl_InstrumentPart`, and the object property `:hasPart` that connects a musical instrument to its parts.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves musical instruments and their parts:

```sparql
SELECT ?instrument ?part
WHERE {
  ?instrument a :Cl_MusicalInstrument .
  ?instrument :hasPart ?part .
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Cl_MusicalInstrument` and their associated parts via the `:hasPart` property, effectively answering the competency question.
