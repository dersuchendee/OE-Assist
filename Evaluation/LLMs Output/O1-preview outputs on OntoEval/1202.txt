The competency question "Who built and/or renovated an organ?" is answerable by the ontology because it includes the relevant classes and properties to model this query. Specifically:

- The ontology defines the class `:Organ`.
- It includes the object properties `:builtBy` (linking an `:Organ` to an `:OrganBuilder`) and `:renovatedBy` (linking an `:Organ` to a `:Person`).
- The classes `:OrganBuilder` (a subclass of `:Person`) and `:Person` are defined.

These elements allow us to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve organs along with their builders and renovators.

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?organ ?organLabel ?builder ?builderLabel ?renovator ?renovatorLabel
WHERE {
    ?organ a :Organ .
    OPTIONAL { ?organ rdfs:label ?organLabel . }
    OPTIONAL { 
        ?organ :builtBy ?builder .
        OPTIONAL { ?builder rdfs:label ?builderLabel . }
    }
    OPTIONAL { 
        ?organ :renovatedBy ?renovator .
        OPTIONAL { ?renovator rdfs:label ?renovatorLabel . }
    }
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of `:Organ` and, where available, their associated builders and renovators, including any labels for better readability.
