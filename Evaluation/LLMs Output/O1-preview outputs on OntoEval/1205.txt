The competency question "Where are the original parts of an organ?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties:

- **Organ**: Represents organs.
- **OrganPart**: Represents parts of organs.
- **hasOriginalPart**: Relates an organ to its original parts.
- **isLocatedIn**: Relates an organ part to its location.
- **Location**: Represents locations where organ parts are located.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the original parts of organs and their locations:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?organLabel ?organPart ?organPartLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?organ a :Organ .
  OPTIONAL { ?organ rdfs:label ?organLabel . }
  
  ?organ :hasOriginalPart ?organPart .
  OPTIONAL { ?organPart rdfs:label ?organPartLabel . }
  
  ?organPart :isLocatedIn ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}
```

This query selects all organs and, for each organ, retrieves its original parts and the locations of those parts. The `OPTIONAL` clauses are used to include labels if they are available in the data.
