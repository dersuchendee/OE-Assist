**Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the ontology, as the `VariantRelationship` class connects a `Composition` and a `TuneFamily` through the properties `:involvesComposition` and `:involvesTuneFamily`, and provides the `:hasLevelOfConfidence` property which indicates the level of confidence.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?levelOfConfidence
WHERE {
  ?variantRelationship a :VariantRelationship .
  ?variantRelationship :involvesComposition :X .
  ?variantRelationship :involvesTuneFamily :Y .
  ?variantRelationship :hasLevelOfConfidence ?levelOfConfidence .
}
