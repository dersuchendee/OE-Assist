This query retrieves all compositions that belong to a specific tune family `:tuneFamilyX`, and for each composition, it retrieves the value of the specified measure `:measureY`. By running this query, you can obtain the measure values for each composition in the tune family, allowing you to analyze their similarities and differences according to that measure.
