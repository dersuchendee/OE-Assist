**Yes**

Here's a SPARQL query that answers the competency question:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?targetTuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?simRel a :SimilarityRelation ;
          :hasSourceTuneFamily :X ;
          :hasTargetTuneFamily ?targetTuneFamily ;
          :hasSimilarityMeasure :Y .
}
```

This query retrieves all the target tune families (`?targetTuneFamily`) that are related to a specific source tune family `:X` using a specific similarity measure `:Y`, as defined in the ontology.
