Answer: **No**

While the ontology defines the classes and properties related to microbial functional guilds, processes like autolithoautotrophy, and habitats, there are no instances (individuals) of these classes in the ontology. Therefore, we cannot retrieve specific microbial functional guilds involved in autolithoautotrophy within specific habitats. The CQ cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Here's a SPARQL query that attempts to extract a partial answer, but it will not return any results due to the absence of instance data:

```sparql
SELECT ?guild ?process ?habitat
WHERE {
  ?guild a :MicrobialFunctionalGuild .
  ?guild :isInvolvedIn ?process .
  ?process a :Autolithoautotrophy .
  ?process :occursInHabitat ?habitat .
}
```
