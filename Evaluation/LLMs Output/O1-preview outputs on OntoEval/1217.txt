**Yes**

The CQ is answerable because the ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to model habitats and their associated microbial and fungal community compositions. Specifically, the ontology includes:

- The class `:Habitat`.
- The properties `:hasMicrobialCommunityComposition` and `:hasFungalCommunityComposition` linking habitats to their microbial and fungal community compositions, respectively.
- The classes `:MicrobialCommunityComposition` and `:FungalCommunityComposition`.

Using these classes and properties, we can write a SPARQL query to identify habitats that have the same microbial and fungal community compositions.

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?habitat1 ?habitat2
WHERE {
  ?habitat1 a :Habitat .
  ?habitat1 :hasMicrobialCommunityComposition ?mcc .
  ?habitat1 :hasFungalCommunityComposition ?fcc .

  ?habitat2 a :Habitat .
  ?habitat2 :hasMicrobialCommunityComposition ?mcc .
  ?habitat2 :hasFungalCommunityComposition ?fcc .

  FILTER (?habitat1 != ?habitat2)
}
```

This query retrieves pairs of habitats (`?habitat1`, `?habitat2`) where both habitats have the same microbial community composition (`?mcc`) and the same fungal community composition (`?fcc`), effectively identifying habitats that are equivalent in terms of their microbial and fungal communities' composition.
