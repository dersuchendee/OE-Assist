This query retrieves all plays that could be seen during each theatre festival by:

- Selecting festivals (`?festival`) of type `ns1:TheatreFestival`.
- Retrieving the productions (`?production`) featured in each festival via `ns1:featuredProduction`.
- Obtaining the plays (`?play`) associated with each production using `ns1:hasPlay`.
- Gathering labels (`?festivalLabel`, `?playLabel`) for readability.

The ontology supports this query because it models the relationships between festivals, productions, and plays through the properties `ns1:featuredProduction` and `ns1:hasPlay`, allowing us to directly query for the plays featured in each festival.
