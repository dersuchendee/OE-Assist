Answer: **Yes**

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?species ?speciesLabel ?characteristic ?charLabel
WHERE {
  ?species a :RareSpecies .
  ?species :isFoundIn ?aquifer .
  ?aquifer a :Aquifer .
  ?species :hasCharacteristic ?characteristic .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?species rdfs:label ?speciesLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?characteristic rdfs:label ?charLabel . }
  
  # Replace :SpecificAquifer with the URI of the specific aquifer you're interested in
  FILTER(?aquifer = :SpecificAquifer)
}
```

In this SPARQL query:
- `?species` selects the rare species.
- `?aquifer` is the specific aquifer of interest (you would replace `:SpecificAquifer` with the actual aquifer URI).
- `?characteristic` retrieves the characteristics of these rare species.
- The ontology provides all the necessary classes and properties to model this competency question:
  - `:RareSpecies` is defined as species with a rarity status of "rare".
  - `:isFoundIn` links species to their habitats, and since `:Aquifer` is a subclass of `:Habitat`, it can be used here.
  - `:hasCharacteristic` links species to their characteristics.
  
Therefore, the ontology supports the competency question, and the SPARQL query can be used to extract the desired information.
