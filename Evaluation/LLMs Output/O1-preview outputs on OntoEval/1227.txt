**Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology defines that a BeechForest has a CO2 fixation pathway, specifically a PrimaryCO2FixationPathway. This relationship is expressed through the `owl:Restriction` on the `:hasCO2FixationPathway` property. Even though there are no specific instances (individuals) of CO2 fixation pathways, the ontology's class hierarchy and property restrictions allow us to retrieve the required information at the class level.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the primary CO2 fixation pathways in beech forests:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?pathway ?pathwayLabel
WHERE {
  :BeechForest rdfs:subClassOf ?restriction .
  ?restriction a owl:Restriction ;
               owl:onProperty :hasCO2FixationPathway ;
               owl:someValuesFrom ?pathway .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?pathway rdfs:label ?pathwayLabel .
  }
}
```

This query works as follows:

1. It starts by finding all the restrictions (`owl:Restriction`) on the `:BeechForest` class that involve the `:hasCO2FixationPathway` property.
2. It retrieves the classes (`?pathway`) that are the `owl:someValuesFrom` in these restrictions.
3. Optionally, it gets the labels (`?pathwayLabel`) of these pathways for readability.

When executed, this query will return the `:PrimaryCO2FixationPathway` class and its label "Primary CO2 Fixation Pathway", effectively answering the competency question.
