**No**

The ontology provided defines a class `:FormOfCarbonFixation` as a subclass of `:CarbonFixationProcess` that occurs in `:ForestSoil`. However, there are no individuals or further subclasses specified under `:FormOfCarbonFixation` to represent the different forms of carbon fixation in forest soils. Under the closed world assumption, we cannot infer or retrieve more specific forms beyond what is explicitly defined in the ontology.

Here's a SPARQL query to attempt to extract any subclasses of `:FormOfCarbonFixation`, but it will not return additional forms since they are not defined in the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?form ?label
WHERE {
    ?form rdfs:subClassOf :FormOfCarbonFixation .
    OPTIONAL { ?form rdfs:label ?label. }
}
```

Since there are no subclasses or instances of `:FormOfCarbonFixation` in the ontology, the query will not yield any results. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.
