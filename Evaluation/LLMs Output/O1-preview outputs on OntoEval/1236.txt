**No**

The CQ asks for the major processes involved in the nitrogen cycle in beech forest ecosystems. However, the ontology does not provide any instances or specific names of these major processes. It only defines the class `:MajorProcess` and its relationships but does not list any individuals or subclasses that would represent actual processes. Therefore, the CQ cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

Here's a partial SPARQL query that attempts to retrieve the major processes but will not return any results due to the absence of instances:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?process
WHERE {
  ?process a :MajorProcess .
}
```
