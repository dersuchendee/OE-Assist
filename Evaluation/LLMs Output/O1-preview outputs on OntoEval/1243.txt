Answer: **Yes**.

The competency question "When is the rate of hospitalisation related to a disease registered?" is answerable using the given ontology. The ontology includes:

- **:HospitalisationRateObservation** class representing hospitalisation rate observations.
- **:isRelatedToDisease** object property connecting a hospitalisation rate observation to a **:Disease**.
- **:hasRegistrationDate** datatype property providing the registration date of the observation.

All necessary classes and properties are present and correctly connected, allowing us to construct a SPARQL query to extract the required information.

```sparql
SELECT ?observation ?observationLabel ?disease ?diseaseLabel ?registrationDate
WHERE {
    ?observation a :HospitalisationRateObservation .
    OPTIONAL { ?observation rdfs:label ?observationLabel . }
    ?observation :isRelatedToDisease ?disease .
    OPTIONAL { ?disease rdfs:label ?diseaseLabel . }
    ?observation :hasRegistrationDate ?registrationDate .
}
```

This query retrieves each hospitalisation rate observation, the disease it is related to, and its registration date.
