The ontology provided lacks temporal information related to admissions, such as dates or durations, which are necessary to compute an average over a specific period. Without this temporal data, we cannot determine the average number of admissions per hospital for a given diagnosis code. However, we can extract the total number of admissions per hospital per diagnosis code. Here's a SPARQL query to obtain this partial information:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?diagnosisCode ?diagnosisCodeLabel (COUNT(?admission) AS ?numAdmissions)
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }

  ?hospital :hasAdmission ?admission .
  
  ?admission :hasDiagnosisCode ?diagnosisCode .
  OPTIONAL { ?diagnosisCode rdfs:label ?diagnosisCodeLabel . }
}
GROUP BY ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?diagnosisCode ?diagnosisCodeLabel
```

This query retrieves each hospital and diagnosis code pair along with the total number of admissions associated with them. Without temporal data, we cannot compute the average admissions over time.
