The competency question "Which codes correspond to each disease category?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology models the necessary classes (`:DiseaseCategory` and `:Code`) and the relationship between them via the property `:hasCode`. This allows us to retrieve the codes associated with each disease category.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?diseaseCategory ?diseaseCategoryLabel ?code ?codeValue
WHERE {
  ?diseaseCategory a :DiseaseCategory .
  OPTIONAL { ?diseaseCategory rdfs:label ?diseaseCategoryLabel . }
  ?diseaseCategory :hasCode ?code .
  OPTIONAL { ?code :codeValue ?codeValue . }
}
```

This query selects disease categories and their corresponding codes, including any available labels and code values.
