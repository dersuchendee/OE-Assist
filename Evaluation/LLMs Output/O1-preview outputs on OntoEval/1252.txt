**Yes**

The ontology provides sufficient classes and properties to express the competency question. Specifically, it contains classes for `Area`, `ChemicalMeasurement`, and `PhysicalMeasurement`, as well as properties that link measurements to areas (`:hasChemicalMeasurement`, `:hasPhysicalMeasurement`). Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve how chemical and physical measurements are distributed across different areas.

Here's a SPARQL query that answers the competency question:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?area ?areaLabel ?measurement ?measurementType ?value
WHERE {
  ?area a :Area .
  OPTIONAL { ?area rdfs:label ?areaLabel . }

  {
    ?area :hasChemicalMeasurement ?measurement .
    OPTIONAL { ?measurement rdfs:label ?measurementLabel . }
    BIND ("ChemicalMeasurement" AS ?measurementType)
    ?measurement :measurementValue ?value .
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?area :hasPhysicalMeasurement ?measurement .
    OPTIONAL { ?measurement rdfs:label ?measurementLabel . }
    BIND ("PhysicalMeasurement" AS ?measurementType)
    ?measurement :measurementValue ?value .
  }
}
ORDER BY ?area ?measurementType
```

This query retrieves each `Area` along with its associated `ChemicalMeasurement` and `PhysicalMeasurement`, including the measurement values. It distinguishes between chemical and physical measurements using the `?measurementType` variable, allowing you to see how these measurements are distributed across different areas.
