The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to answer the competency question. The class `:ChemicalMeasurement` is linked to `:Water` via the `:inMedium` property, and it has the `:hasConcentrationValue` property with `xsd:float` values. Therefore, we can query for chemical measurements in water and extract their concentration values.

```sparql
SELECT ?measurement ?value
WHERE {
  ?measurement a :ChemicalMeasurement .
  ?measurement :inMedium :Water .
  ?measurement :hasConcentrationValue ?value .
}
```
