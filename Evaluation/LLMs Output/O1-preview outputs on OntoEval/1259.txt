Answer: **Yes**

The competency question asks: "What is the quantity of a flow at a specific time?". 

This CQ can be answered using the provided ontology because it models the necessary concepts and relationships. The ontology includes the classes `:Flow` and `:FlowMeasurement`, with properties connecting them, such as `:hasMeasurement`, `:hasQuantityValue`, `:hasUnit`, and `:hasTime`. This allows us to retrieve the quantity value of a flow at a specific time.

Here is a SPARQL query that extracts the required information:

```sparql
SELECT ?flow ?quantityValue ?unit ?time
WHERE {
  ?flow a :Flow .
  ?flow :hasMeasurement ?measurement .
  ?measurement :hasQuantityValue ?quantityValue .
  ?measurement :hasUnit ?unit .
  ?measurement :hasTime ?time .
}
```

This query selects all flows and, for each flow, retrieves its associated measurement quantity value, unit, and time. If you're interested in a specific time, you can add a `FILTER` clause to specify the time of interest, for example:

```sparql
SELECT ?flow ?quantityValue ?unit
WHERE {
  ?flow a :Flow .
  ?flow :hasMeasurement ?measurement .
  ?measurement :hasQuantityValue ?quantityValue .
  ?measurement :hasUnit ?unit .
  ?measurement :hasTime ?time .
  FILTER (?time = "2023-10-17T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
```

This modified query retrieves the quantity of flows specifically at the time "2023-10-17T00:00:00".
