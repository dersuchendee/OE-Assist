**No**

```sparql
SELECT ?material ?origin ?process
WHERE {
  ?material a :Material .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?material :hasOrigin ?origin .
  }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?material :undergoesProcess ?process .
  }
}
```

We cannot retrieve the complete trace of processes that the material undergoes due to limitations in representing and querying the sequence of processes in the ontology. The ontology provides the `:hasNextProcess` property to link processes, but without ordering or additional properties to manage sequences, it's not possible to extract the entire process chain in order using SPARQL. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.
