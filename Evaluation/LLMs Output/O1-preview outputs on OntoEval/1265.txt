SELECT ?entity ?entityType ?legalCondition ?legislation
WHERE {
  {
    ?legalCondition a :LegalCondition .
    ?legalCondition :affectsActor ?entity .

The competency question "What is the legal conditions and legislation affecting this actor/object/process?" is modeled by the ontology provided. The SPARQL query above retrieves all `Actor`, `Object`, or `Process` instances (`?entity`) that are affected by a `LegalCondition` (`?legalCondition`) via the properties `:affectsActor`, `:affectsObject`, or `:affectsProcess`. It also retrieves the `Legislation` (`?legislation`) that governs each `LegalCondition` through the property `:governedBy`.

This query effectively answers the competency question by leveraging the relationships defined in the ontology:

- `LegalCondition` affects `Actor`, `Object`, or `Process` via the respective properties.
- Each `LegalCondition` may be governed by some `Legislation`.

By querying these relationships, we can extract the necessary information to determine which legal conditions and legislations are affecting specific actors, objects, or processes within the domain described by the ontology.
