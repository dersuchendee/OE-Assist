Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "Was the (material, information) exchange successful?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology defines the classes `:MaterialExchange` and `:InformationExchange`, both subclasses of `:Exchange`. Each `:Exchange` instance is linked to an `:ExchangeEvaluation` through the property `:hasEvaluation`, and each `:ExchangeEvaluation` has an `:isSuccessful` boolean property indicating the success of the exchange.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves each material or information exchange and indicates whether it was successful:

```sparql
SELECT ?exchange ?exchangeType ?isSuccessful
WHERE {
  ?exchange a ?exchangeType .
  FILTER (?exchangeType IN (:MaterialExchange, :InformationExchange))
  ?exchange :hasEvaluation ?evaluation .
  ?evaluation :isSuccessful ?isSuccessful .
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:MaterialExchange` and `:InformationExchange`, retrieves their evaluations, and checks the `:isSuccessful` property to determine if the exchange was successful.
