**No**

The ontology does not contain information about the efficiency of a process. Therefore, we cannot directly answer the competency question "How efficient is this process?" using the provided ontology. However, we can extract partial information about the `:CollaborationProcess` and its required information types.

```sparql
SELECT ?process ?requiredInfoType
WHERE {
  ?process a :CollaborationProcess .
  ?process ?requiresProperty ?info .
  FILTER(?requiresProperty IN (
    :requiresInfrastructureInfo, 
    :requiresProcessInfo, 
    :requiresEnergyRecoveryInfo, 
    :requiresStakeholderInfo, 
    :requiresEnergyDemandSurplusInfo, 
    :requiresValueInfo))
  BIND(REPLACE(STR(?requiresProperty), "^.*(#)", "") AS ?requiredInfoType)
}
```

This query retrieves the types of information that a `:CollaborationProcess` requires, which provides partial insight into the process but does not address its efficiency.
