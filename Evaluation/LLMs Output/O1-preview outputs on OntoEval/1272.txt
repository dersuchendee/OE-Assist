This query retrieves the types of information needed for collaboration processes as specified in the ontology. The ontology defines a `:CollaborationProcess` class that must be associated with several types of information through various `:requires*` properties. The query accesses these restrictions on the `:CollaborationProcess` class and extracts the names of the information types required, answering the competency question "What information is needed to collaborate and align processes?" based on the provided ontology.
