```sparql
SELECT ?bellSet ?playingMethods
WHERE {
  ?bellSet a :BellSet .
  ?bellSet :hasPlayingMethod ?method .
  ?method a ?methodType .
  FILTER(?methodType IN (:Manual, :Electric))
  BIND(STRAFTER(STR(?methodType), "#") AS ?playingMethods)
}
GROUP BY ?bellSet
```

This query retrieves each `BellSet` and determines whether it can be played manually, electrically, or both by checking the associated `PlayingMethod` instances. The `FILTER` ensures we're only considering `:Manual` and `:Electric` methods. The `BIND` with `STRAFTER` is used to extract the local name of the method type for readability.
