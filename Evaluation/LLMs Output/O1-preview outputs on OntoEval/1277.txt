**Yes**

The competency question "Which is the weight of the bell?" can be answered using the given ontology because it includes the class `:Bell` and the datatype property `:hasWeight`, which allows us to retrieve the weight of each bell.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the weights of the bells:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?bell ?weight
WHERE {
  ?bell a :Bell .
  ?bell :hasWeight ?weight .
}
```

This query selects all individuals of type `:Bell` and retrieves their associated weights using the `:hasWeight` property.
