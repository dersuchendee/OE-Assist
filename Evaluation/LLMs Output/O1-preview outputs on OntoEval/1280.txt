Answer: **No**

The ontology does not include information about the gender of musicians, so we cannot determine "she". Therefore, the competency question "Where did she perform?" cannot be fully answered.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract partial answers (locations where any musician performed):

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT DISTINCT ?musician ?musicianLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?event a :PerformanceEvent .
  ?event :performedBy ?musician .
  ?event :performedAt ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?musician rdfs:label ?musicianLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}
```
