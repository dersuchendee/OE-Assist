The ontology supports the competency question "What is the nature of the event?" because it defines the class `:Event` with the object property `:hasNature` linking it to an instance of `:EventType`. This allows us to query for events and their natures as specified by the ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves events and their associated natures:

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?eventLabel ?nature ?natureLabel
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  OPTIONAL { ?event rdfs:label ?eventLabel . }
  ?event :hasNature ?nature .
  OPTIONAL { ?nature rdfs:label ?natureLabel . }
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Event` and retrieves their `:hasNature` property values, which are instances of `:EventType`. It also attempts to retrieve any labels associated with the events and event types for better readability.
