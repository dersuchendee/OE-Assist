**Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology because events have event types via the `:hasEventType` property, and the possible event types include `:Celebration`, `:Festival`, and `:PrivateEvent`, which are subclasses of `:EventType`. We can retrieve events that have an event type of Celebration, Festival, or PrivateEvent by querying the events and their associated event types.

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?eventLabel ?eventType ?eventTypeLabel
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  OPTIONAL { ?event rdfs:label ?eventLabel . }
  
  ?event :hasEventType ?eventTypeInstance .
  ?eventTypeInstance a ?eventType .
  OPTIONAL { ?eventType rdfs:label ?eventTypeLabel . }
  
  FILTER (?eventType IN (:Celebration, :Festival, :PrivateEvent))
}
```
