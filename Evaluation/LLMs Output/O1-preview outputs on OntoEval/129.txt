**Yes**

The ontology supports the competency question, as it defines the necessary classes and properties to connect theatre festivals to plays through the `:hasPlay` property. Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the plays that could be seen during each theatre festival:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival rdf:type :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalName . }
  ?festival :hasPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playName . }
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Cl_TheatreFestival` and retrieves the plays associated with each festival via the `:hasPlay` property. It also attempts to get any labels (`rdfs:label`) for the festivals and plays if they are available.
