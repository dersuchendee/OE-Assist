**Answer: Yes**

The competency question asks whether there was a power relation (e.g., Patron/Musician). The ontology models `PowerRelation` as a class with properties that connect it to `Person` via `hasSuperior` and `hasSubordinate`, and to `RelationType` via `hasRelationType`. Even though specific instances (e.g., specific patrons or musicians) are not provided in the ontology, the structure allows us to query for power relations.

Here is the SPARQL query to retrieve existing power relations:

```sparql
SELECT ?powerRelation ?superior ?subordinate ?relationType
WHERE {
  ?powerRelation a :PowerRelation .
  ?powerRelation :hasSuperior ?superior .
  ?powerRelation :hasSubordinate ?subordinate .
  ?powerRelation :hasRelationType ?relationType .
}
```

This query selects all instances of `PowerRelation` and retrieves their associated superior and subordinate persons, as well as the type of relation. If the ontology had instances of `PowerRelation`, this query would extract them, thus answering the competency question affirmatively.
