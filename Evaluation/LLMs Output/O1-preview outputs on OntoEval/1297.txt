We can answer the competency question "Who built and/or renovated an organ?" using the given ontology. The ontology contains classes and properties that allow us to retrieve organ builders who have either built or renovated an organ.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves organ builders who built or renovated organs:

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?organBuilder ?organBuilderLabel ?organ ?organLabel ?role
WHERE {
  {
    ?organ a :Organ ;
           :hasBuilder ?organBuilder .
    BIND("Builder" AS ?role)
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?organ a :Organ ;
           :hasRestoration ?restoration .
    ?restoration :hasRenovator ?organBuilder .
    BIND("Renovator" AS ?role)
  }
  OPTIONAL { ?organBuilder rdfs:label ?organBuilderLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?organ rdfs:label ?organLabel . }
}
```

This query selects organ builders who are either the builder (`:hasBuilder`) or the renovator (`:hasRenovator` through a `:Restoration`) of an organ. The `UNION` clause combines both possibilities, and the `BIND` function assigns the role ("Builder" or "Renovator") accordingly. The optional `rdfs:label` properties are included to retrieve any labels for the organ builders and organs if they are available.
