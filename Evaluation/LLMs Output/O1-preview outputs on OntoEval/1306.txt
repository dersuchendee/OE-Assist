**Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology models relationships between tune families through the `:TuneFamilyRelationship` class, which connects a source tune family to a target tune family using a specific similarity measure.

Here is a SPARQL query to find the tune families related to a specific tune family `:TuneFamily_X` given a similarity measure `:SimilarityMeasure_Y`:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?targetTuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?relationship a :TuneFamilyRelationship ;
                :hasSource :TuneFamily_X ;
                :hasTarget ?targetTuneFamily ;
                :usesSimilarityMeasure :SimilarityMeasure_Y .
}
```

Replace `:TuneFamily_X` with the IRI of the tune family you're interested in, and `:SimilarityMeasure_Y` with the IRI of the specific similarity measure.
