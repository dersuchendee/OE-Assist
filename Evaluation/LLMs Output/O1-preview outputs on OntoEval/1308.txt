**No**

Given the ontology, there are no instances of Aquifer fungi or Chemical parameters definedâ€”we only have class definitions and property restrictions. Therefore, we cannot extract specific associations between individual aquifer fungi and chemical parameters. However, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the class-level relationships specified in the ontology.

Here's a SPARQL query that extracts the chemical parameters associated with aquifer fungi at the class level:

```sparql
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?aquiferFungusClass ?chemicalParameterClass
WHERE {
  ?aquiferFungusClass rdfs:subClassOf* :AquiferFungus .
  ?aquiferFungusClass rdfs:subClassOf ?restriction .
  ?restriction a owl:Restriction ;
               owl:onProperty :hasAssociatedChemicalParameter ;
               owl:someValuesFrom ?chemicalParameterClass .
}
```

This query retrieves all subclasses of `:AquiferFungus` and the `:ChemicalParameter` classes they're associated with through the `:hasAssociatedChemicalParameter` property. Although this doesn't provide specific instances, it gives us the structural information available in the ontology.
