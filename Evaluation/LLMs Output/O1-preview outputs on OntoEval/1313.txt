The competency question asks: *What role do aquifer fungi play in the biogeochemical cycling within aquifers?*

In the given ontology, we have:

- `:AquiferFungi` as a subclass of `:Microbe`.
- `:hasRoleInCycle` as an object property from `:Microbe` to `:BiogeochemicalCycle`.
- `:BiogeochemicalCycle` occurs in `:Habitat`, with `:Aquifer` being a subclass of `:Habitat`.

However, the ontology does not specify the specific roles that `:AquiferFungi` play in `:BiogeochemicalCycle` within `:Aquifer`. There is no property or data that details the exact roles or functions. Therefore, under the closed world assumption, the CQ cannot be fully answered as the ontology lacks necessary details about the roles.

Here's a SPARQL query that extracts a partial answer, showing that `:AquiferFungi` have some role in `:BiogeochemicalCycle` occurring in `:Aquifer`, but without specifying what that role is:

```sparql
SELECT ?fungi ?cycle ?aquifer
WHERE {
  ?fungi a :AquiferFungi .
  ?fungi :hasRoleInCycle ?cycle .
  ?cycle a :BiogeochemicalCycle .
  ?cycle :occursIn ?aquifer .
  ?aquifer a :Aquifer .
}
```

This query retrieves the instances of aquifer fungi, the biogeochemical cycles they are involved in, and the aquifers where these cycles occur. It demonstrates the relationships present in the ontology but does not provide details on the specific roles played by the fungi.
