**No**

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?carbonFixationForm
WHERE {
  ?carbonFixationForm a :CarbonFixationForm .
}
```
The ontology defines the class **:CarbonFixationForm** but does not include any instances or subclasses of this class. Without specific instances of carbon fixation forms, we cannot retrieve the different forms of carbon fixation in forest soils. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology. The SPARQL query attempts to select instances of **:CarbonFixationForm**, but it will not return any results due to the absence of individual data in the ontology.
