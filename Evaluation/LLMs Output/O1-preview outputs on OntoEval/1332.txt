**No**

The given ontology lacks sufficient detail to specify the role of denitrifying bacteria in the denitrification process. While it defines that denitrifying bacteria participate in the denitrification process and have some role, it does not specify what that role is. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the ontology. Here is a SPARQL query that attempts to extract a partial answer based on the available information:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?processLabel ?bacteriaLabel ?role
WHERE {
  :DenitrificationProcess rdfs:label ?processLabel .
  
  # Retrieve the bacteria that participate in the denitrification process
  :DenitrificationProcess rdfs:subClassOf ?processRestriction .
  ?processRestriction a owl:Restriction ;
                      owl:onProperty :hasParticipant ;
                      owl:someValuesFrom ?bacteriaClass .
  ?bacteriaClass rdfs:label ?bacteriaLabel .
  
  # Retrieve the roles associated with the denitrifying bacteria
  ?bacteriaClass rdfs:subClassOf ?bacteriaRestriction .
  ?bacteriaRestriction a owl:Restriction ;
                       owl:onProperty :hasRole ;
                       owl:someValuesFrom ?roleClass .
  
  # Optional: Get labels for the roles if available
  OPTIONAL { ?roleClass rdfs:label ?roleLabel . }
  
  BIND (IF(BOUND(?roleLabel), ?roleLabel, STR(?roleClass)) AS ?role)
}
```

This query attempts to find the roles associated with the denitrifying bacteria participating in the denitrification process. However, since the ontology does not define specific roles (no subclasses or instances of `:Role` are provided), the query cannot retrieve detailed role information, resulting in a partial answer.
