**Answer: Yes**

**Explanation:**
The ontology includes the `HospitalizationRate` class, which has a `hasRegistrationDate` property (with range `xsd:date`) and is related to a `Disease` via the `relatesToDisease` property.

Given this, we can retrieve instances of `HospitalizationRate` that are related to a `Disease` and obtain their registration dates.
