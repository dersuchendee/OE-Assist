Answer: **Yes**

The CQ is answerable because the ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to retrieve contaminated sites located in a geographical area with recorded observation times. All the classes and properties mentioned in the CQ (:ContaminatedSite, :GeographicalArea, :hasObservation, :hasRecordedTime, and :locatedIn) are defined in the ontology, allowing us to construct a SPARQL query to extract the required information.

```sparql
SELECT ?site ?siteLabel ?area ?areaLabel ?date
WHERE {
    ?site a :ContaminatedSite .
    OPTIONAL { ?site rdfs:label ?siteLabel . }
    ?site :locatedIn ?area .
    OPTIONAL { ?area rdfs:label ?areaLabel . }
    ?site :hasObservation ?observation .
    ?observation :hasRecordedTime ?date .
}
```
