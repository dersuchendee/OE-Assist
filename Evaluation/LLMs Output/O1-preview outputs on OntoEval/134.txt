The Competency Question is supported by the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
    ?festival rdf:type :Cl_TheatreFestival .
    ?festival :festivalName ?festivalName .
    ?festival :hasPlay ?play .
    ?play :playName ?playName .
}
```

This query retrieves the plays associated with each theatre festival in the ontology, matching the CQ "What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?"
