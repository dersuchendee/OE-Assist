**Yes**

The competency question is answerable using the ontology provided since all the required classes and properties are modeled and interconnected appropriately. The ontology includes the classes `:Recorder`, `:Measurement`, `:MicrobiologicalSubstance`, and `:SurfaceWater`, along with properties that relate these classes (`:recordedBy`, `:measuresSubstance`, `:hasLocation`, and `:hasTime`).

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the recorders who record measurements of microbiological substances in surface waters along with the associated times:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?recorder ?measurement ?surfaceWater ?time
WHERE {
    ?measurement a :Measurement .
    ?measurement :recordedBy ?recorder .
    ?measurement :measuresSubstance ?substance .
    ?measurement :hasLocation ?surfaceWater .
    ?measurement :hasTime ?time .
}
```

This query selects the `?recorder`, `?measurement`, `?surfaceWater`, and `?time` where:

- `?measurement` is an instance of `:Measurement`.
- `?measurement` is recorded by `?recorder` (`:recordedBy` property).
- `?measurement` measures a microbiological substance (`:measuresSubstance` property).
- `?measurement` has a location in surface water (`:hasLocation` property).
- `?measurement` has a time associated with it (`:hasTime` property).

This satisfies the competency question by identifying who records the amounts of microbiological substances in surface waters over time.
