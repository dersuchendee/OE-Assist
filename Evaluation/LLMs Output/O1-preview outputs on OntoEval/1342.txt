Answer: **Yes**

The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to answer the competency question. The class `:ChemicalLevelRecording` represents observations of chemical substances in water bodies and is associated with a recording date (`:hasRecordingDate`), the chemical substance recorded (`:recordsChemical`), and the water body where it was recorded (`:recordedIn`). Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the dates when levels of chemical substances were recorded in water bodies.

```sparql
SELECT ?chemicalLevelRecording ?chemicalSubstance ?waterBody ?recordingDate
WHERE {
  ?chemicalLevelRecording a :ChemicalLevelRecording .
  ?chemicalLevelRecording :recordsChemical ?chemicalSubstance .
  ?chemicalLevelRecording :recordedIn ?waterBody .
  ?chemicalLevelRecording :hasRecordingDate ?recordingDate .
}
```
