Answer: **Yes**

The competency question asks: "When is the rate of hospitalisation related to a disease registered?"

This question can be answered by querying `HospitalisationRateObservation` instances that are related to a `Disease` and have a `hasRegistrationDate`. Since the ontology defines the necessary classes and properties (`HospitalisationRateObservation`, `Disease`, `isRelatedToDisease`, and `hasRegistrationDate`), we can construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the required information.

```sparql
SELECT ?observation ?disease ?registrationDate
WHERE {
  ?observation a :HospitalisationRateObservation .
  ?observation :hasRegistrationDate ?registrationDate .
  ?observation :isRelatedToDisease ?disease .
}
```
