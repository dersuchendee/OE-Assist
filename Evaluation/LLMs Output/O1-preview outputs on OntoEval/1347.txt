**No**

The ontology defines the necessary classes and properties to represent the relationship between disease categories and codes via the `:hasCode` property. However, it does not include any instances (individuals) of `:DiseaseCategory` or `:Code`. Therefore, under the closed world assumption, the competency question cannot be fully answered because there is no data to retrieve.

Here is a SPARQL query that attempts to extract a partial answer by retrieving any available information about disease categories and their corresponding codes:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?diseaseCategory ?diseaseCategoryLabel ?code ?codeLabel
WHERE {
  ?diseaseCategory a :DiseaseCategory .
  OPTIONAL { ?diseaseCategory rdfs:label ?diseaseCategoryLabel . }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?diseaseCategory :hasCode ?code .
    OPTIONAL { ?code rdfs:label ?codeLabel . }
  }
}
```

This query searches for instances of `:DiseaseCategory` and their associated `:Code` instances through the `:hasCode` property. Since there are no individuals defined in the ontology, the query would return an empty result set.
