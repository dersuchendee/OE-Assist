Answer: **Yes**

Here's a SPARQL query to extract the spatial distribution of chemical and physical measurements across different areas:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?measurement ?measurementType ?area ?spatialDistribution
WHERE {
  {
    ?measurement a :ChemicalMeasurement .
    BIND("ChemicalMeasurement" AS ?measurementType)
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?measurement a :PhysicalMeasurement .
    BIND("PhysicalMeasurement" AS ?measurementType)
  }
  OPTIONAL { ?measurement :locatedInArea ?area . }
  OPTIONAL { ?measurement :hasSpatialDistribution ?spatialDistribution . }
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of `ChemicalMeasurement` and `PhysicalMeasurement`, along with their associated areas and spatial distributions. It leverages the `locatedInArea` and `hasSpatialDistribution` properties defined in the ontology to link measurements to areas and spatial distributions, thereby answering the competency question using the provided ontology.
