**No**

The ontology does not provide information linking `ChemicalMeasurement` to "water" or specify that the measurements are taken in water. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question. However, we can retrieve the units of measure used in chemical measurements in general:

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?unitOfMeasure
WHERE {
    ?measurement a :ChemicalMeasurement .
    ?measurement :hasUnit ?unitOfMeasure .
}
```
