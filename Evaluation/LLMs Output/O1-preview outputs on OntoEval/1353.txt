**No**

The ontology does not fully support the competency question as it lacks the necessary temporal properties to associate organ parts with specific points in time. While the ontology defines the `Parthood` class and associates it with `Organ` and `TimeInterval`, there is no property linking `Parthood` instances directly to the parts. Therefore, we cannot retrieve the parts of an organ at a specific point in time. However, we can extract the parts of an organ without temporal information using the following partial SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?organ ?part
WHERE {
    ?organ a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/Organ> .
    ?organ <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/includesPart> ?part .
}
```
