The ontology does not provide enough information to determine whether an agent built or renovated an organ specifically. While we can find the agents associated with a project related to an organ, the ontology lacks details about the specific tasks (like building or renovating) performed by those agents. Therefore, under the closed-world assumption, we cannot fully answer the competency question.
