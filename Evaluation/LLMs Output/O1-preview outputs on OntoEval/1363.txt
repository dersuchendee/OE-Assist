**No**

The ontology does not include the concepts of "execution techniques" or "mounting systems", so it is not possible to write a SPARQL query to fully answer the competency question: "What kind of execution techniques are possible to perform according to a specific mounting system?"

However, a partial answer can be obtained by retrieving bells and their associated sets of bells.

```sparql
SELECT ?bell ?bellLabel ?setOfBells ?setLabel
WHERE {
  ?bell a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/Bell> .
  OPTIONAL { ?bell rdfs:label ?bellLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { 
    ?bell <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/isComponentOf> ?setOfBells .
    OPTIONAL { ?setOfBells rdfs:label ?setLabel . }
  }
}
```

This query retrieves bells and the sets of bells they are part of, but without information about mounting systems or execution techniques, it cannot fully answer the competency question.
