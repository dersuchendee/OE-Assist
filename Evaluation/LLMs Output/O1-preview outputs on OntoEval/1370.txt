**No**

The given ontology does not provide any properties or data about when a building, such as a BellTower, was built. Therefore, we cannot answer the competency question "When (what year) was the building built?" using the provided ontology.

However, we can create a SPARQL query to extract partial information, such as the list of bell towers:

```sparql
SELECT ?bellTower
WHERE {
  ?bellTower a <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/BellTower> .
}
```
