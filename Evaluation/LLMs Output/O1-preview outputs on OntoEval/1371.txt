**No**

The ontology does not contain information about the context (urban, periurban) of building locations. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using this ontology. However, we can extract information about the bell towers defined in the ontology.

```sparql
PREFIX bell: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/>

SELECT ?building
WHERE {
  ?building a bell:BellTower .
}
```
