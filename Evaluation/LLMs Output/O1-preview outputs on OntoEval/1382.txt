The competency question "What was the reason for this meeting?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes the class `mtps:Meetup` representing meetings and the property `mtps:hasAPurpose` that links a meetup to its purpose (`mtps:Purpose`). The purpose is an enumerated set of predefined individuals such as `mtps:BusinessCareer`, `mtps:Education`, etc.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the purpose of a specific meeting. You would replace `mtps:SpecificMeeting` with the actual identifier of the meeting you're interested in.

```sparql
PREFIX mtps: <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?purposeLabel
WHERE {
  mtps:SpecificMeeting a mtps:Meetup .
  mtps:SpecificMeeting mtps:hasAPurpose ?purpose .
  OPTIONAL { ?purpose rdfs:label ?purposeLabel . }
}
```

If you want to retrieve the reasons for all meetings in the dataset, you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
PREFIX mtps: <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?meeting ?purposeLabel
WHERE {
  ?meeting a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meeting mtps:hasAPurpose ?purpose .
  OPTIONAL { ?purpose rdfs:label ?purposeLabel . }
}
```

This query will provide the purpose of each meeting by linking `mtps:Meetup` instances to their associated `mtps:Purpose` via the `mtps:hasAPurpose` property.
