Answer: **Yes**.

The competency question asks for the places where "they played", which corresponds to the meetups with the purpose of "MusicMaking" in the ontology. The ontology includes the class `mtps:Meetup`, which has properties `mtps:hasAPurpose` (with possible value `mtps:MusicMaking`) and `mtps:hasPlace` (linking to `core:Location`). Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the places where the meetups for MusicMaking took place.

```sparql
PREFIX mtps: <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#>
PREFIX core: <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/core/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?place ?placeLabel WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasAPurpose mtps:MusicMaking .
  ?meetup mtps:hasPlace ?place .
  OPTIONAL { ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel . }
}
```
