**No**

The given ontology does not define a property that relates a `:Tune` (which represents a composition) to a `:TuneFamily`. Therefore, we cannot answer the competency question "Which tune family does composition X belong to?" directly from this ontology.

However, we can provide a partial answer by listing all tunes, but we cannot determine their tune families.

```sparql
SELECT ?tune ?tuneLabel
WHERE {
  ?tune a :Tune .
  OPTIONAL { ?tune rdfs:label ?tuneLabel . }
}
```
