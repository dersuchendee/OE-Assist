**No**

The ontology provided does not contain sufficient classes or properties to answer the competency question "Who assigned composition X to tune family Y?". Specifically, the ontology lacks:

- A class or property representing an **assignment action** linking compositions to tune families.
- A representation of **agents** (the "who") who perform such assignments.
- Properties linking **compositions** to **tune families**.

Without these elements, we cannot model the relationship required to answer the CQ. However, we can extract partial information about tunes and their sources.

```sparql
SELECT ?tune ?tuneLabel ?source ?sourceLabel
WHERE {
  ?tune a :Tune .
  OPTIONAL { ?tune rdfs:label ?tuneLabel . }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?tune core:hasSource ?source .
    OPTIONAL { ?source rdfs:label ?sourceLabel . }
  }
}
```
