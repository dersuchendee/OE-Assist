Given the provided ontology and under the closed world assumption, we cannot answer the competency question "What are the similarities/differences of all compositions in tune family X according to measure Y?" because the ontology lacks the necessary properties and classes to represent:

- The association between tunes and tune families (there is no property connecting `:Tune` instances to `:TuneFamily` instances).
- Any measures (`Y`) that could be used to compare tunes (no properties or data relating to characteristics or features of tunes).

The SPARQL query above extracts all instances of `:Tune`, but without the ability to associate them with tune families or measures, we cannot provide even a partial answer to the competency question.
