**No**

The ontology does not provide properties or relationships to represent similarity measures between tune families. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question.

However, we can retrieve the existing tune families in the ontology as a partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?tuneFamily
WHERE {
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
}
```
