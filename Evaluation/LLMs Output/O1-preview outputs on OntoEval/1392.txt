**No**

Unfortunately, the given ontology does not provide sufficient information or properties to fully answer the competency question. Specifically, there are no properties defined that link tunes to tune families, nor are there properties that associate tune families to composers. Therefore, we cannot retrieve tunes that compose a tune family associated with a composer.

However, we can extract a partial answer by listing the tunes defined in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?tune
WHERE {
  ?tune a :Tune .
}
```
