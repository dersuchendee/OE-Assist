Answer: **No**

The ontology does not provide a way to specify or identify a particular theatre festival (e.g., by festival name or identifier). Therefore, we cannot extract the plays for a specific theatre festival. However, we can retrieve the plays associated with all theatre festivals.

Partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival rdf:type :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasPlay ?festivalPlay .
  ?festivalPlay :playName ?playName .
}
```
