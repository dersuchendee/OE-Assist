Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "In what city is a certain theatre located?" is answerable because the ontology includes classes `theatre:Theatre` and `theatre:City`, and they are connected through the property `theatre:locatedIn`. This allows us to retrieve the city for any given theatre.

SELECT ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?theatre rdf:type theatre:Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel . }
  ?theatre theatre:locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}
