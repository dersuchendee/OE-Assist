**Yes**

The ontology defines the classes `:Cl_Theatre` and `:Cl_City`, and the object property `:located_in` connecting theatres to cities. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the city in which a certain theatre is located.

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel . }
  
  ?theatre :located_in ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}
```
