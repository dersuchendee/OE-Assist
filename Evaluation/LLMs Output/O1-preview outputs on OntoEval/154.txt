**No**

The ontology does not fully support the competency question because there is no explicit object property linking a theatre to a city individual (instance of `Cl_City`). Instead, the theatre's location is stored as a string literal in the data property `dp_location`. Therefore, we cannot retrieve the city as an individual but can only obtain the city name as a string. Here's a SPARQL query that extracts the partial answer:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?theatre ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :dp_location ?cityName .
}
```

This query selects theatres and their location names, but it doesn't link theatres to city individuals within the ontology.
