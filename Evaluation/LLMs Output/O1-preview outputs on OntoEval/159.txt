The competency question can be answered using the ontology provided. We can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the city in which a certain theatre is located by traversing the relationships defined in the ontology.

Here's the SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?cityName
WHERE {
   ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
   ?theatre :locatedIn ?theatreLocation .
   ?theatreLocation :cityName ?cityName .
}
```

This query works as follows:
- It selects all instances `?theatre` of the class `:Cl_Theatre`.
- For each theatre, it finds the associated `?theatreLocation` through the `:locatedIn` property.
- It then retrieves the `?cityName` from the `?theatreLocation` using the `:cityName` data property.

The ontology defines `:Cl_TheatreLocation` as a reification class that is a subclass of both `:Cl_Theatre` and `:Cl_City`, connecting theatres with cities. The `:cityName` property is associated with `:Cl_TheatreLocation`, allowing us to extract the city's name.
