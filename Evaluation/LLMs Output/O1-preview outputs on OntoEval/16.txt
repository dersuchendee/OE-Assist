Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "When was an instrument invented?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_MusicalInstrument` representing musical instruments. Each instrument can be linked to an invention event through the object property `:op_hasInvention`, which relates an instrument to an `:Cl_InstrumentInvention` instance. The invention event has a data property `:dp_inventionDate` that captures the date of invention. Therefore, we can retrieve the invention dates of instruments using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?instrument ?inventionDate
WHERE {
  ?instrument a :Cl_MusicalInstrument .
  ?instrument :op_hasInvention ?invention .
  ?invention :dp_inventionDate ?inventionDate .
}
```

This query selects all instruments and their corresponding invention dates by traversing the relationships defined in the ontology.
