Answer: **Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology models the relationship between theatres and cities through the object property `:isLocatedIn`, which connects instances of `:Cl_Theatre` to instances of `:Cl_TheatreLocation`. The class `:Cl_TheatreLocation` is a pivot class that is a subclass of both `:Cl_Theatre` and `:Cl_City`. The city information is captured using the data property `:cityName`.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the theatres and the cities they are located in:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :isLocatedIn ?theatreLocation .
  ?theatreLocation a :Cl_TheatreLocation .
  ?theatreLocation :cityName ?city .
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of theatres and their associated city names by traversing the relationships defined in the ontology.
