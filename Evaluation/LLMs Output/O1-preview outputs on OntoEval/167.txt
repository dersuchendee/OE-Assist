**No**

The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" is not fully supported by the ontology because the relationship between cities and countries is only partially modeled. Specifically, only the city of Rome is linked to a country (Italy) in the ontology, while other cities like Pisa and Venice are not associated with any country. Under the closed world assumption, we cannot infer the countries for these other cities.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract the available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?city :op_isLocatedIn ?country .
  }
}
```

This query will return cities and their associated countries where such relationships are defined in the ontology. For cities without the `:op_isLocatedIn` relation, the `?country` variable will be `NULL`, indicating that the country information is not available in the ontology.
