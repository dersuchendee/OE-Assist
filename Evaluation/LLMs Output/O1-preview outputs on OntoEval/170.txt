Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the relevant classes and properties to represent cities, countries, and the relationship between them. Specifically, it defines:

- `:Cl_City` as a subclass of `:Cl_Place`.
- `:Cl_Country` as a subclass of `:Cl_Place`.
- `:cityLocatedInCountry` as an object property with domain `:Cl_City` and range `:Cl_Country`.

This allows us to query for cities and their corresponding countries. Here's a SPARQL query that extracts this information:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityName . }
  ?city :cityLocatedInCountry ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryName . }
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of `:Cl_City`, optionally gets their labels (names), and finds the country each city is located in through the `:cityLocatedInCountry` property, also optionally retrieving the country's label.
