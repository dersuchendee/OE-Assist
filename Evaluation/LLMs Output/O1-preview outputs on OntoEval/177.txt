Answer: **Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology because cities are represented as instances of `:Cl_City` and their countries are specified using the data property `:dp_country`.

Here's the SPARQL query to retrieve the country of a certain city:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
    ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
    ?city :dp_country ?country .
}
```
