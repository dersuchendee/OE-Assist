```sparql
Answer: **Yes**

Here's a SPARQL query that answers the competency question:

```sparql
SELECT ?countryLabel
WHERE {
    ?city rdf:type :Cl_City ;
          rdfs:label "Rome" ;
          :cityInCountry ?country .
    ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel .
}
```

This query finds the country in which the city "Rome" is located by traversing the `:cityInCountry` relationship from the city instance to the country instance, and retrieving the country's label.
