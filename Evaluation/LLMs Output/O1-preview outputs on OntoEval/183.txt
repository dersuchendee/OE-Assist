Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the necessary classes and object properties to represent cities and countries and their relationships.

From the ontology snippets, we have:

- Class `:Cl_City`
- Class `:Cl_Country`
- Object Property `:locatedIn` with domain `:Cl_City` and range `:Cl_Country`

Here's the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?country .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?city :cityName ?cityName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?country :countryName ?countryName . }
}
```

This query selects all cities and the countries they are located in. It also attempts to retrieve the names of the cities and countries if the `:cityName` and `:countryName` data properties are provided in the data.
