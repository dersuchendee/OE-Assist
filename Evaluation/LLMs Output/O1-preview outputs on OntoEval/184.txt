Answer: **No**

The CQ "In what country is a certain city located?" cannot be fully answered with the given ontology because there is no data property or label associated directly with the `:Cl_City` class to identify specific cities. Although there is an object property `:isLocatedInCountry` connecting cities to a `:Cl_CityLocation`, and a data property `:countryName` in `:Cl_CityLocation`, we lack a way to reference or retrieve specific cities by name.

Here is a partial SPARQL query that attempts to retrieve cities and their corresponding countries:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedInCountry ?location .
  ?location :countryName ?countryName .
}
```

This query would list all cities and their countries if instances and necessary properties (like city names) were properly defined in the ontology.
