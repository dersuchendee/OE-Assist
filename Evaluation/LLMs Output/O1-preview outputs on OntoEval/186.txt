The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `Cl_City` and the data property `:isLocatedInCountry` which relates a city to its country.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves cities and the countries they are located in:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedInCountry ?country .
}
```

This query selects all instances of `Cl_City` and retrieves the associated country via the `:isLocatedInCountry` property.
