The Competency Question "What play is the basis of this production?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology defines the necessary classes and relationships to connect a production to the play it is based on.

In the ontology:

- `:Cl_Production` represents a production.
- `:Cl_Play` represents a play.
- `:Cl_ProductionBasedOnPlay` is a class that connects productions to plays.
- The object property `:hasBasis` links a production to a `:Cl_ProductionBasedOnPlay`.
- The object property `:basedOn` links a `:Cl_ProductionBasedOnPlay` to a play.

The SPARQL query retrieves productions and the plays they are based on by navigating these relationships.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
    ?production a :Cl_Production .
    ?production :hasBasis ?productionBasis .
    ?productionBasis a :Cl_ProductionBasedOnPlay .
    ?productionBasis :basedOn ?play .
}
```
