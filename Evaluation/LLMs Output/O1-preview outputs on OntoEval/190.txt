The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to relate a production to the play it is based on. Specifically, it includes:

- **Classes**:
  - `:Cl_Production` - Represents a production.
  - `:Cl_Play` - Represents a play.
  - `:Cl_ProductionBasedOnPlay` - Represents productions that are based on plays.

- **Object Properties**:
  - `:hasBasis` - Relates a `:Cl_Production` to a `:Cl_ProductionBasedOnPlay`.
  - `:basedOn` - Relates a `:Cl_ProductionBasedOnPlay` to a `:Cl_Play`.

- **Restrictions and Equivalences**:
  - `:Cl_ProductionBasedOnPlay` is defined such that any instance is equivalent to a production that is based on some play.

Using these, we can write a SPARQL query to find the play that is the basis of each production.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?production ?productionName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasBasis ?productionBasedOnPlay .
  ?productionBasedOnPlay :basedOn ?play .

  OPTIONAL { ?production :hasName ?productionName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasName ?playName . }
}
```

This query retrieves all productions and their corresponding plays by traversing the relationships defined in the ontology:

- It selects instances of `:Cl_Production`.
- Uses `:hasBasis` to find the associated `:Cl_ProductionBasedOnPlay`.
- From there, uses `:basedOn` to find the `:Cl_Play` the production is based on.
- `OPTIONAL` clauses are used to retrieve names if available.

**Therefore, the competency question "What play is the basis of this production?" is supported by the ontology.**
