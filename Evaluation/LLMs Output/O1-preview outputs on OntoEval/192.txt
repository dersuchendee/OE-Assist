Answer: **Yes**.

The CQ "What play is the basis of this production?" is answerable because the ontology includes the object property `theatre:hasPlay` that links a `theatre:TheatreProduction` to the `theatre:Play` it is based on. This allows us to query the play associated with a given production.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the play for a specific production (replace `theatre:MerchantOfVeniceProduction` with the URI of the production in question):

```sparql
SELECT ?playLabel
WHERE {
  theatre:MerchantOfVeniceProduction theatre:hasPlay ?play .
  ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel .
}
```

If you want to retrieve the plays for all productions, you can use the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?productionLabel ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?production a theatre:TheatreProduction .
  ?production theatre:hasPlay ?play .
  ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel .
  ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel .
}
```

This query selects all productions and their associated plays by utilizing the `theatre:hasPlay` property defined in the ontology.
