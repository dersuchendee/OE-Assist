Based on the provided ontology, the competency question "What play is the basis of this production?" can be answered. The ontology includes classes `:TheatreProduction` and `:Play`, with an object property `:productionOf` that relates a theatre production to the play it is a production of.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?production ?productionName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?production a :TheatreProduction .
  OPTIONAL { ?production :hasName ?productionName . }

  ?production :productionOf ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasName ?playName . }
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of `:TheatreProduction`, the plays they are productions of via the `:productionOf` property, and optionally their names using the `:hasName` property.
