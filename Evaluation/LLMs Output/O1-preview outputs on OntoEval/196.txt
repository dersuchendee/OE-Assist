The given Ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to model the concepts in the competency question. The class `:Cl_Production` represents productions, `:Cl_Play` represents plays, and the property `:isBasedOn` connects a production to the play it is based on.

Here is the SPARQL query to answer the competency question:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production rdf:type :Cl_Production .
  ?production :isBasedOn ?play .
}
```

This query retrieves all productions and their associated plays by leveraging the `:isBasedOn` property defined in the Ontology.
