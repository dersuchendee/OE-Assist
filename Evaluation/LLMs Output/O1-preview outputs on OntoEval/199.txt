**Yes**

The ontology includes the `:isBasedOn` property linking a `:Cl_Production` to the `:Cl_Play` it is based on. Therefore, the competency question "What play is the basis of this production?" is supported by the ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the plays that are the basis of each production:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?production ?play ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?production rdf:type :Cl_Production .
  ?production :isBasedOn ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasTitle ?playTitle . }
}
```

This query selects all productions and their corresponding plays, including the titles of the plays if available.
