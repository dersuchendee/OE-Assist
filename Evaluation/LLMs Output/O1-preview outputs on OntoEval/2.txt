**Answer: Yes**

The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to determine the credibility of a source. Each `:Cl_Source` instance can have a `:hasCredibilityAssessment` property linking it to a `:Cl_SourceCredibilityAssessment`, which in turn has a `:hasCredibilityLevel` property providing the credibility information.

```sparql
SELECT ?source ?credibilityLevel
WHERE {
  ?source a :Cl_Source .
  ?source :hasCredibilityAssessment ?assessment .
  ?assessment :hasCredibilityLevel ?credibilityLevel .
}
```
