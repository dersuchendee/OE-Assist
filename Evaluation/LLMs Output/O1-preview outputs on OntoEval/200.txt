**Yes**

The competency question "What play is the basis of this production?" is answerable with the given ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_TheatreProduction` and the object property `:op_isBasedOnPlay` which relates a theatre production to the play it is based on. We have an individual `:MerchantOfVeniceProduction` of type `:Cl_TheatreProduction`, which is linked to the play `:TheMerchantOfVenice` via the property `:op_isBasedOnPlay`. Thus, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the play that is the basis of any given production.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_TheatreProduction .
  ?production :op_isBasedOnPlay ?play .
}
```

This query retrieves all theatre productions and the plays they are based on, directly answering the competency question using the ontology data.
