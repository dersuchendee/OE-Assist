**Answer: Yes**

The competency question can be answered because the ontology includes the classes `:Cl_Production` and `:Cl_Play`, and the object property `:basedOnPlay` that connects a production to the play it is based on.

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :basedOnPlay ?play .
}
```
