This query retrieves the members of ensembles who were part of the ensemble at the specified point in time. The `Cl_EnsembleMembership` class reifies the membership relationship between actors and ensembles with start and end dates, allowing us to filter members based on the time period of their membership.

Replace `:SpecificEnsemble` with the URI of the ensemble you are interested in, and `"YYYY-MM-DD"` with the specific date you want to query.
