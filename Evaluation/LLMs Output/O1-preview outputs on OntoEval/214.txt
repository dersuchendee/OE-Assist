**No**

The ontology does not provide sufficient data to answer the CQ fully. Specifically, there are no instances of `ns1:Ensemble`, and therefore we cannot directly retrieve members of a certain ensemble at a specific point in time. However, we can extract a partial answer by finding individuals who have roles in a production at a given time, which may indirectly represent ensemble membership.

```sparql
PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?individual ?individualLabel ?roleLabel ?productionLabel ?time
WHERE {
  ?individual a ns1:Person ;
              ns1:hasTimeIndexedRole ?timeIndexedRole .
  ?timeIndexedRole ns1:hasRole ?role ;
                   ns1:atTime ?time .
  ?role ns1:inProduction ?production .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?individual rdfs:label ?individualLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
  
  FILTER (?time = "2009-09-07T00:00:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
```

This query retrieves individuals (actors) who have a role in a production at a specific time. While it does not directly reference ensembles, it provides information about the actors involved in a production at a given time, which may be helpful for partially answering the CQ.
