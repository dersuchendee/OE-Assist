**No**

The ontology lacks time data about ensemble membership. While it defines the concept of an ensemble and its members, and even includes the `atTime` property, there are no instance data connecting ensemble memberships to specific points in time. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" using this ontology.

However, we can extract a partial answer by retrieving the members of ensembles without the time aspect:

```sparql
PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?ensembleLabel ?member ?memberLabel
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a theatre:Ensemble .
  OPTIONAL { ?ensemble rdfs:label ?ensembleLabel . }
  ?ensemble theatre:hasMember ?member .
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves ensembles and their members, but does not include time information since it's not available in the ontology.
