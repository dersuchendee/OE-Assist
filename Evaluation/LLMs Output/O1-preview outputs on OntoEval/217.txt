This SPARQL query retrieves the actors who are members of a specific ensemble at a given point in time. It works by finding `EnsembleMembership` instances where the `:ensemble` matches the desired ensemble and the `:member` is an actor whose membership period (`:during`) includes the specified `?givenTime`. The `FILTER` ensures that only memberships valid at `?givenTime` are considered.
