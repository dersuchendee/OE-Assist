```sparql
# SPARQL query to find water bodies that belong to a specific water basin
# Replace :SpecificWaterBasin with the URI of the water basin of interest

SELECT ?waterBody
WHERE {
   ?waterBody a :Cl_WaterBody .
   ?waterBody :op_belongsTo :SpecificWaterBasin .
}
```

This SPARQL query selects all instances of `:Cl_WaterBody` that have a relationship `:op_belongsTo` to a specific water basin (`:SpecificWaterBasin`). You can replace `:SpecificWaterBasin` with the URI of the water basin you're interested in to retrieve the corresponding water bodies.
