Answer: **No**.

The ontology lacks information about the duration of membership, specifically membership end dates. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine who are the members of a certain ensemble at a specific point in time.

Partial answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?member
WHERE {
  # Specify the ensemble URI and date as parameters
  BIND(<http://www.example.org/test#YourEnsemble> AS ?ensemble)
  BIND("YYYY-MM-DD"^^xsd:date AS ?date)

  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?member .
  ?member :hasMembershipDate ?membershipDate .
  FILTER(?membershipDate <= ?date)
}
```

This query retrieves members who joined the ensemble on or before the specified date, but without membership end dates, we cannot confirm if they were still members at that time.
