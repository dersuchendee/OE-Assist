**No**

The ontology does not provide sufficient properties to relate an actor to an ensemble at a specific point in time because there is no clear way to determine if an actor is still a member of the ensemble at that time. The `Cl_EnsembleMembership` class is a subclass of `Cl_Ensemble`, `Cl_Actor`, and `Cl_Date`, but there are no properties that connect an actor's membership start and end dates to allow for filtering by a specific time.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the actors who are members of an ensemble, but it cannot filter by a specific point in time:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?ensemble ?actorName
WHERE {
  ?ensemble rdf:type :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_EnsembleMembership .
  ?membership :actorName ?actorName .
}
```
