Answer: **Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?date
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership :memberName ?member .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?date .
  FILTER(?date = "YYYY-MM-DD"^^xsd:date)  # Replace with the desired date
}
```

This query retrieves the members (`?member`) of a specific ensemble (`?ensemble`) who are associated with a particular membership date (`?date`). By specifying the date in the `FILTER` clause, you can find out who were the members of the ensemble at that specific point in time.
