**No**

The ontology does not model the end date of ensemble memberships, so we cannot determine the members of an ensemble at a specific point in time. We can only know the date when each person became a member.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract partial information:

```sparql
SELECT ?ensemble ?ensembleName ?person ?personName ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  OPTIONAL { ?ensemble rdfs:label ?ensembleName . }
  
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership .
  
  ?membership a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership rdfs:label ?personName . }
  
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
}
ORDER BY ?ensemble ?person ?membershipDate
```

This query retrieves the ensembles, their members, and the dates when each person became a member. However, without information about when memberships end, we cannot accurately determine the members at a specific point in time.
