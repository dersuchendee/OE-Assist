Answer: **No**

The CQ cannot be fully answered with the given ontology because it lacks the necessary information to determine whether a member is part of an ensemble at a specific point in time. The ontology provides a `:membershipDate`, which likely represents the start date of membership, but there is no information about the end date or duration of membership. Therefore, we cannot ascertain if a person was a member during the specified time.

However, we can extract partial information about ensemble members and their membership start dates:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?memberName ?membershipDate
WHERE {
    ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
    ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
    ?membership :memberName ?memberName .
    ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
    # Filter for a specific ensemble if known
    # FILTER (?ensemble = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificEnsembleURI>)
    # Filter for members who joined on or before the specified date
    # FILTER (?membershipDate <= xsd:date("YYYY-MM-DD"))
}
```

This query retrieves members of an ensemble along with their membership start dates. Without information about when or if the membership ended, we cannot determine membership at a specific point in time.
