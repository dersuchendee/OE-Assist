This query retrieves all plays (`?play`) and their titles (`?playTitle`) that were written by a specific authorâ€”in this case, "William Shakespeare". The ontology provides the necessary classes (`:Cl_Play`, `:Cl_Author`), properties (`:op_writtenBy`, `:dp_title`, `:dp_authorName`), and individuals to answer the competency question.
