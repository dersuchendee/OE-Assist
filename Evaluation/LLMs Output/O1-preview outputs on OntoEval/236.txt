This SPARQL query retrieves the plays written by a specific author. It matches plays of type `:Cl_Play` that are connected via the `:op_writtenBy` property to an author of type `:Cl_Author`. By filtering on the author's name (e.g., "William Shakespeare"), it extracts the titles of the plays written by that author.
