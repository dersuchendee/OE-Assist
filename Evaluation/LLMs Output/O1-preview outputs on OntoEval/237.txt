**Answer: Yes**

The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" is answerable using the given ontology. Despite the inconsistency in the directionality of the `ns1:wrotePlay` property between its definition and usage in the ontology, we can still retrieve the plays associated with an author.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the plays written by a specific author (e.g., William Shakespeare):

```sparql
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?play a ns1:Play .
  ?play ns1:wrotePlay ns1:WilliamShakespeare .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
```

This query does the following:
- Selects all resources (`?play`) that are instances of `ns1:Play`.
- Filters those plays that have the `ns1:wrotePlay` property pointing to `ns1:WilliamShakespeare`.
- Optionally retrieves the label of the play for readability.

**Note:** The ontology uses the `ns1:wrotePlay` property from the `Play` to the `Author`, despite its definition indicating the property should go from `Author` to `Play`. For the purpose of answering the CQ with the given data, we adapt the query to match the data usage.
