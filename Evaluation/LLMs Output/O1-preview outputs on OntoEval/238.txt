**Yes**

The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to represent authors and the plays they have written. Specifically, it includes:

- **Classes**:
  - `theatre:Author`: Represents an author.
  - `theatre:Play`: Represents a play.
  
- **Properties**:
  - `theatre:wrote`: An object property that links an `Author` to the `Play` they wrote.
    - **Domain**: `theatre:Author`
    - **Range**: `theatre:Play`
  - `theatre:writtenBy`: An inverse of `theatre:wrote`, linking a `Play` to its `Author`.
    - **Domain**: `theatre:Play`
    - **Range**: `theatre:Author`

Given this structure, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the plays written by a certain author.

Here is the SPARQL query:

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?authorName ?play ?playTitle
WHERE {
  # Specify the author of interest by name
  ?author rdf:type theatre:Author .
  ?author rdfs:label ?authorName .
  FILTER(?authorName = "William Shakespeare")  # Replace with the desired author's name
  
  # Find plays written by the author
  ?author theatre:wrote ?play .
  ?play rdf:type theatre:Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playTitle . }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The query selects the author's name, the play URI, and the play title.
- It filters for the specific author by their name (`?authorName = "William Shakespeare"`). You can replace `"William Shakespeare"` with any other author's name present in the ontology.
- It retrieves all plays (`?play`) that the author has written using the `theatre:wrote` property.
- It ensures that the plays are of type `theatre:Play`.
- It optionally retrieves the play's title using the `rdfs:label` property.

**Usage Example:**

If you run this query against the provided ontology, it will return:

| authorName          | play                           | playTitle                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| "William Shakespeare" | theatre:MerchantOfVenice       | "The Merchant of Venice" |

**Conclusion:**

Since we can retrieve the plays written by a certain author using the ontology and the SPARQL query above, the competency question is supported by the ontology.
