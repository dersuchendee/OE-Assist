The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that connect authors to the plays they have written via a writing event. Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the plays written by a specific author:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?author ?authorLabel
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }

  ?play :hasWritingEvent ?writingEvent .
  ?writingEvent :hasAuthor ?author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorLabel . }

  # If you want to specify a certain author, uncomment and modify the following line:
  # FILTER(?author = :Specific_Author_URI)
}
```

This query selects plays (`?play`) and their associated authors (`?author`) by traversing the relationships defined in the ontology:

- It finds instances of `:Cl_Play`.
- It retrieves the `:hasWritingEvent` associated with each play.
- It then gets the `:hasAuthor` of each writing event.
- Labels are retrieved where available for better readability.

If you have a specific author in mind (e.g., William Shakespeare), you can filter the results by their URI:

```sparql
FILTER(?author = :William_Shakespeare)
```

This query effectively answers the competency question by utilizing the ontology's structure that models the relationship between authors and plays through writing events.
