Answer: **Yes**

The ontology includes the classes `:Play` and `:Author`, and the object property `:hasAuthor` which relates a play to its author. It also includes the datatype property `:hasName` for naming authors and plays. Therefore, the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the ontology.

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve the plays written by a specific author:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>

SELECT ?play ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  ?play :hasAuthor ?author .
  ?author :hasName "Desired Author Name" .
  ?play :hasTitle ?playTitle .
}
```

Replace `"Desired Author Name"` with the name of the author you're interested in, for example, `"William Shakespeare"`.
