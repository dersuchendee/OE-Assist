**No**

Under the closed world assumption, the ontology lacks the necessary data properties to specify a certain author (e.g., author names or identifiers). Therefore, we cannot fully answer the Competency Question "What plays did a certain author write?" because we cannot specify the particular author within the ontology.

However, we can provide a partial answer that lists all authors and the plays they have written:

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?play
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  ?author :hasWritten ?play .
}
```
