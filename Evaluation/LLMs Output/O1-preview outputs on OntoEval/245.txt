Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that relate authors to the plays they have written.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the plays written by a specific author:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?play ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?author rdf:type :Cl_Author .
  ?author :hasName ?authorName .
  FILTER(?authorName = "William Shakespeare")  # Replace with the desired author's name
  ?author :wrotePlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasTitle ?playTitle . }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The query selects variables `?play` and `?playTitle`.
- It searches for individuals `?author` of type `:Cl_Author`.
- Filters authors by their `:hasName` property to match the desired author (e.g., "William Shakespeare").
- Retrieves the plays connected to the author via the `:wrotePlay` property.
- Optionally fetches the title of each play using the `:hasTitle` property.

**Note:** Replace `"William Shakespeare"` in the `FILTER` clause with the name of the author you're interested in.

**Example Result:**

Assuming the ontology data provided, the query will return:

| play                                | playTitle                    |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| :TheMerchantOfVenice                | "The Merchant of Venice"     |
| :Othello                            | "Othello"                    |
| :AMidsummerNightsDream              | "A Midsummer Night's Dream"  |

This shows the plays written by William Shakespeare as defined in the ontology.
