**Yes**

The competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" is answerable using the given ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_Author`, the class `:Cl_Play`, and the object property `:wrotePlay` that links authors to the plays they've written. Therefore, we can construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the plays written by a specific author.

Here is the SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?author rdf:type :Cl_Author .
  ?author :authorName ?authorName .
  ?author :wrotePlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
  FILTER(?authorName = "William Shakespeare")  # Replace with the desired author's name
}
```

This query selects all plays (`?play`) and their names (`?playName`) where the author (`?author`) has the specified `authorName`. You can replace `"William Shakespeare"` in the FILTER clause with the name of the author you are interested in.
