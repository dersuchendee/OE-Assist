Answer: **Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?product ?manufacturer
WHERE {
  # Find manufacturing processes that produce the product
  ?manufacturingProcess a process:ManufacturingProcess .
  ?manufacturingProcess process:resultingProduct ?product .

  # Find the actor participating as manufacturer in the manufacturing process
  ?processParticipation a actor:ProcessParticipation .
  ?processParticipation actorODP:participationIn ?manufacturingProcess .
  ?processParticipation actorODP:participatingActor ?manufacturer .
  ?processParticipation actorODP:participantRole actor:manufacturer .
}
```

This SPARQL query retrieves the manufacturer of a certain product by finding the actor who participates in the manufacturing process that results in the product, with the role of a manufacturer.
