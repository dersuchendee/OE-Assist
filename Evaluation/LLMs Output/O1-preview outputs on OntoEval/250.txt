Answer: **Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?playName WHERE {
  ?authorPlay a :Cl_AuthorPlay ;
              :hasAuthor ?author ;
              :hasPlay ?play .
  ?author :authorName ?authorName .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
  FILTER(?authorName = "Author Name")
}
ORDER BY ?playName
```

Replace `"Author Name"` with the name of the author you are interested in, for example `"William Shakespeare"`:

```sparql
SELECT ?playName WHERE {
  ?authorPlay a :Cl_AuthorPlay ;
              :hasAuthor ?author ;
              :hasPlay ?play .
  ?author :authorName "William Shakespeare" .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
ORDER BY ?playName
```

This query retrieves the names of plays written by the specified author from the ontology.
