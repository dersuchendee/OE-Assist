In the provided ontology, we can retrieve the plays written by a certain author. The property `:wrotePlay` connects instances of `:Cl_Author` to instances of `:Cl_Authorship`, which is a reification class combining `:Cl_Author` and `:Cl_Play`. Since `:Cl_Authorship` is a subclass of both `:Cl_Author` and `:Cl_Play`, it effectively represents the relationship between an author and a play they wrote.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract the plays written by each author:

```sparql
SELECT ?author ?authorName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author :authorName ?authorName . }
  
  ?author :wrotePlay ?authorship .
  ?authorship a :Cl_Authorship .
  
  # Since :Cl_Authorship is a subclass of :Cl_Play, we can treat ?authorship as a play.
  BIND(?authorship AS ?play) .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
}
```

This query performs the following steps:

- Selects individuals of type `:Cl_Author` and retrieves their names.
- Finds the `:Cl_Authorship` instances connected via `:wrotePlay`.
- Binds the `?authorship` to `?play` because `:Cl_Authorship` is a subclass of `:Cl_Play`.
- Retrieves the names of the plays written by the authors.

This query will return all authors and the plays they have written, as defined in the ontology.
