**Answer:** **Yes**

Here, the CQ is answerable because the ontology models authors and plays, and the relationship "hasWritten" connects authors to plays via the reification class `Cl_Authorship`. The `playTitle` data property allows us to retrieve the titles of the plays written by authors.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?author ?playTitle
WHERE {
    ?author a :Cl_Author .
    ?author :hasWritten ?authorship .
    ?authorship :playTitle ?playTitle .
}
```

This SPARQL query retrieves authors (`?author`) and the titles of the plays (`?playTitle`) they have written by navigating through the `hasWritten` object property and accessing the `playTitle` data property of the `Cl_Authorship` class.
