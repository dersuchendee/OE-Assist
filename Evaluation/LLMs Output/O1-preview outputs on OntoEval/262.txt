Answer: **Yes**

The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to retrieve the time period during which a play was written. Specifically, it models the relationships between a play, its writing event, and the associated time period with start and end years.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the writing time period for each play:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  
  ?play :hasWritingEvent ?writingEvent .
  ?writingEvent :hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  
  ?timePeriod :startYear ?startYear .
  ?timePeriod :endYear ?endYear .
}
```

This query retrieves the plays and their corresponding writing periods by navigating through the `:hasWritingEvent` and `:hasTimePeriod` properties. It selects the start and end years (`:startYear` and `:endYear`) from the `:Cl_TimePeriod` class associated with each writing event.
