Answer: **Yes**.

The CQ is answerable because the ontology includes the `:Cl_PlayTimePeriod` class and properties `:hasPlayTimePeriod`, `:startYear`, and `:endYear`, which connect plays with the time periods during which they were written.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :hasPlayTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :startYear ?startYear .
  ?timePeriod :endYear ?endYear .
}
```
