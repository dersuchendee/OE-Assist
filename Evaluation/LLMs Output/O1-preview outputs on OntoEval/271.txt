SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?play rdf:type :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  ?play :hasWritingPeriod ?writingPeriod .
  ?writingPeriod :writingStartDate ?startDate .
  ?writingPeriod :writingEndDate ?endDate .
}
```

This query retrieves plays along with their writing periods by connecting the `:Cl_Play` instances to their associated `:Cl_PlayWritingPeriod` via the `:hasWritingPeriod` property, and then extracting the `:writingStartDate` and `:writingEndDate` from the writing period.
