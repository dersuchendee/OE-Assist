```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?playName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName ;
        :writtenDuring ?timePeriodInstance .
  ?timePeriodInstance :timePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
```

This query retrieves all plays along with the time periods during which they were written, as specified in the ontology through the `:writtenDuring` property linking a `:Cl_Play` to a `:Cl_TimePeriod`.

If you want to find the time period for a specific play, for example "The Merchant of Venice", you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName "The Merchant of Venice" ;
        :writtenDuring ?timePeriodInstance .
  ?timePeriodInstance :timePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
```

This query filters the results to only include the specified play, returning the time period during which it was written.
