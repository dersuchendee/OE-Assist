**Answer: Yes**

The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to determine the time period during which a play was written. The relationship between a play and its time period is modeled using the `:writtenDuring` object property linking a `:Cl_Play` to a `:Cl_PlayCreation`, which has the `:timePeriod` data property.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the time period during which each play was written:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :writtenDuring ?playCreation .
  ?playCreation :timePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
```

This query retrieves all plays and their associated time periods by traversing the `:writtenDuring` property from the play to its creation time period.
