SELECT ?play ?timePeriodValue
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :timePeriodValue ?timePeriodValue .
}
```

This SPARQL query retrieves the time period during which each play was written, by navigating from the `Cl_Play` class through the `:writtenDuring` object property to the `Cl_TimePeriod` class, and then extracting the `:timePeriodValue` data property which holds the textual representation of the time period. This directly answers the competency question: "During what time period was a certain play written?"
