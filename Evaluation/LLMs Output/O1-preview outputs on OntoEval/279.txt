**No**

The ontology does not directly connect `:Cl_Play` to any property that provides the play's title, making it impossible to specify a certain play by name in the query. However, we can retrieve the creation periods of plays in general.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?creationPeriod
WHERE {
  ?play rdf:type :Cl_Play .
  ?play :wasWrittenDuring ?creation .
  ?creation :creationPeriod ?creationPeriod .
}
```

This query retrieves plays and their associated creation periods, but without the ability to identify a specific play by title, we cannot fully answer the competency question.
