Answer: **Yes**

The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to retrieve the roles of an actor in a network through the `:Cl_ActorRole` class and its associated properties. By querying instances of `:Cl_ActorRole`, we can determine the roles that a specific actor holds within a specific material flow (network).

```sparql
SELECT ?role
WHERE {
  ?actorRole a :Cl_ActorRole .
  ?actorRole :actorInNetwork :GivenActor .
  ?actorRole :roleInNetwork ?role .
  ?actorRole :materialFlowOfNetwork :GivenNetwork .
}
```

Replace `:GivenActor` with the URI of the specific actor and `:GivenNetwork` with the URI of the specific network (material flow) you are interested in.
