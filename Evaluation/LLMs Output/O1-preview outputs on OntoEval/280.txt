**Yes**.

The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that connect a play to its act information and the number of acts. Specifically, the `:hasActInformation` object property connects an instance of `:Cl_Play` to an instance of `:Cl_PlayActInformation`, which has the `:actCount` data property representing the number of acts.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the number of acts for each play:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?actCount
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :hasActInformation ?actInfo .
  ?actInfo :actCount ?actCount .
}
```
