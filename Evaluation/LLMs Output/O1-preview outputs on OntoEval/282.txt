```sparql
SELECT ?play ?actCount
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasActCount ?actCount . }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?play :hasActInformation ?actInfo .
    ?actInfo :actCount ?actCount .
  }
}
```

This SPARQL query retrieves all instances of plays (`?play`) and their corresponding number of acts (`?actCount`). It accounts for both modeling approaches present in the ontology:

1. **Direct Property**: Some plays may have the `:hasActCount` data property directly associated with them.
2. **Reified Information**: Other plays might have an associated `:Cl_PlayActInformation` instance through the `:hasActInformation` object property, which then has the `:actCount` data property.

By using OPTIONAL clauses, the query ensures that it captures the act count regardless of how it's modeled in the ontology. The `?actCount` variable will be bound if either of the properties exists for a play.
