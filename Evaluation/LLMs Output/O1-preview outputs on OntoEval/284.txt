**Answer: Yes**

The ontology includes information about plays and the number of acts they contain through the property `theatre:hasNumberOfActs`. Therefore, the competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" is answerable using this ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the number of acts for each play:

```sparql
PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?playLabel ?numActs
WHERE {
  ?play a theatre:Play .
  ?play theatre:hasNumberOfActs ?numActs .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
```

This query selects all resources of type `theatre:Play`, retrieves their labels (if available), and the number of acts each play contains via the `theatre:hasNumberOfActs` property.
