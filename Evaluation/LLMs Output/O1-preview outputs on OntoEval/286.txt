**Yes**

Here's a SPARQL query to determine the number of acts that a particular play contains:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?playTitle (COUNT(?act) AS ?numberOfActs)
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  ?play :hasTitle ?playTitle .
  # Specify the title of the play you're interested in
  FILTER(?playTitle = "The Merchant of Venice") .
  ?play :hasAct ?act .
}
GROUP BY ?playTitle
```

**Explanation:**

The ontology supports answering the competency question because it includes:

- The classes **:Play** and **:Act** to represent plays and their acts.
- The object property **:hasAct** (a sub-property of **:hasPart**) to associate plays with their acts.
- The datatype property **:hasTitle** to provide the title of the play.

By counting the number of **:Act** instances associated with a particular **:Play** via the **:hasAct** property, we can determine how many acts the play contains. The FILTER clause allows you to specify the particular play you're interested inâ€”in this case, "The Merchant of Venice".

This query will return the title of the play and the number of acts it contains, satisfying the competency question.
