Answer: **Yes**

Because the ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to answer the competency question. The class `:Cl_Play` represents a play, and the property `:hasNumberOfActs` (with domain `:Cl_Play` and range `xsd:integer`) allows us to retrieve the number of acts for each play. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the number of acts that a particular play contains.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?play ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :hasNumberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```
