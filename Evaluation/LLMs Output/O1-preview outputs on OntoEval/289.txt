**Answer: Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology defines the class `:Cl_Play` and a datatype property `:containsActs` with domain `:Cl_Play` and range `xsd:integer`. This allows us to retrieve the number of acts that a particular play contains.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?numActs
WHERE {
    ?play rdf:type :Cl_Play .
    ?play :containsActs ?numActs .
}
```
