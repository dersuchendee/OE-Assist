**Yes**

You can retrieve the number of acts for each play using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :hasNumberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Cl_Play` and retrieves their associated `:hasNumberOfActs` values, thus answering the competency question: "How many acts does a particular play contain?"
