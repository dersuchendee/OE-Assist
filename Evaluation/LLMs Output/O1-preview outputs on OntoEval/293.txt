**Yes**

The Competency Question (CQ) "How many acts does a particular play contain?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_Play` and a data property `:hasNumberOfActs` that connects a play to its number of acts.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the number of acts for each play:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?playTitle ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
    ?play rdf:type :Cl_Play .
    OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playTitle . }
    ?play :hasNumberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```

If you want to find the number of acts for a specific play (e.g., "MerchantOfVenice"), you can use the following query:

```sparql
SELECT ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
    :MerchantOfVenice rdf:type :Cl_Play .
    :MerchantOfVenice :hasNumberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The ontology defines `:Cl_Play` as a class representing plays.
- The data property `:hasNumberOfActs` links a play to an integer value representing the number of acts.
- The individual `:MerchantOfVenice` is an instance of `:Cl_Play` and has the property `:hasNumberOfActs` with the value `5`.

Therefore, the CQ is fully supported by the ontology, and the provided SPARQL queries can extract the required information under the closed-world assumption.
