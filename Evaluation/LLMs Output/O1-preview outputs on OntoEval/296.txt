**Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?playName ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play rdf:type :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName .
  ?playActs rdf:type :Cl_PlayActs ;
            :hasPlay ?play ;
            :hasNumberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```

The CQ is answerable because the ontology includes information about plays and their number of acts through the `:Cl_PlayActs` class, which connects a play (`:hasPlay`) to its number of acts (`:hasNumberOfActs`). For example, the ontology contains the instance `:PlayActs_TheMerchantOfVenice` representing that "The Merchant of Venice" has 5 acts.
