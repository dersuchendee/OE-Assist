**Answer: Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to retrieve the number of acts a play contains. Specifically, the ontology defines the `:containsActs` object property linking `:Cl_Play` to `:Cl_PlayActs`, and the data property `:numberOfActs` to obtain the number of acts.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?play ?playName ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play rdf:type :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
  ?play :containsActs ?acts .
  ?acts :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```

This query selects plays, their names (if available), and the number of acts they contain by navigating the relationships defined in the ontology.
