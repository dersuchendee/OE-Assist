We can answer the competency question "Which is the credibility of a source?" using the given ontology. The ontology defines classes and properties that allow us to link a `Source` to its `CredibilityAssessment`, which includes the credibility score and explanation. Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the credibility information for each source.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?source ?sourceLabel ?credibilityScore ?credibilityExplanation ?expertLabel
WHERE {
  ?source a :Source .
  OPTIONAL { ?source rdfs:label ?sourceLabel . }

  ?source :hasCredibilityAssessment ?assessment .

  ?assessment :hasCredibilityScore ?credibilityScore .
  OPTIONAL { ?assessment :hasCredibilityExplanation ?credibilityExplanation . }
  OPTIONAL { 
    ?assessment :assessedBy ?expert .
    OPTIONAL { ?expert rdfs:label ?expertLabel . }
  }
}
```

This query performs the following:

- Selects all individuals of type `:Source`.
- Retrieves the optional label of the source (`?sourceLabel`).
- Finds the associated `:CredibilityAssessment` via the property `:hasCredibilityAssessment`.
- Retrieves the credibility score (`?credibilityScore`) and optional explanation (`?credibilityExplanation`).
- Optionally retrieves the expert who made the assessment and their label (`?expertLabel`).

This query will provide the credibility of each source as defined in the ontology.
