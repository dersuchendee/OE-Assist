Answer: **No**

The ontology lacks a way to identify or specify a particular play because there is no property for play names or identifiers (e.g., labels). Therefore, we cannot answer the competency question fully. However, we can provide a partial answer by listing all plays and their number of acts.

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?numActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :numActs ?numActs .
}
```
