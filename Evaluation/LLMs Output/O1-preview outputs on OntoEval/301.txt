Answer: **No**

The competency question cannot be fully answered by the ontology because there is no way to identify a particular play; the ontology lacks a data property or label to specify the name of a play. While the ontology includes the class `:Cl_Play` and the data property `:numberOfActs` (which provides the number of acts for plays), without a property to identify specific plays, we cannot determine the number of acts for a specific play.

However, we can extract a partial answer by retrieving the number of acts for all plays in the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play rdf:type :Cl_Play .
  ?play :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
```

This query returns all plays along with their number of acts, but it does not allow us to select a particular play.
