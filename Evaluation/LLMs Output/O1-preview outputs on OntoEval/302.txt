**Yes**

The competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_PlayStructure`, which is a subclass of `:Cl_Play`, and the data property `:numberOfActs`, which has the domain `:Cl_PlayStructure` and range `xsd:integer`. This allows us to retrieve the number of acts associated with a play.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the required information:

```sparql
SELECT ?play ?numActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_PlayStructure ;
        :numberOfActs ?numActs .
}
```

This query selects instances of `:Cl_PlayStructure` and retrieves the `:numberOfActs` for each play, effectively answering the competency question.
