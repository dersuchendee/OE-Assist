The ontology contains the necessary classes and properties to answer the competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?". Specifically, it models productions (`:Cl_Production`), premier events (`:Cl_ProductionPremierDate`), and the dates associated with these events via the `:premierDate` property. Therefore, we can write the following SPARQL query to extract the premiere dates of productions:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premiereDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremierDate ?premierEvent .
  ?premierEvent :premierDate ?premiereDate .
}
```

This query retrieves all productions and their associated premiere dates by navigating from the production to its premier event and then extracting the date.
