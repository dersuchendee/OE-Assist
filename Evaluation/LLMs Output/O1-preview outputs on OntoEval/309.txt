We can answer the competency question "When was the premiere of a certain production?" using the given ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that represent theatre productions and their premiere dates.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the premiere date of theatre productions:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionName ?playTitle ?premiereDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :TheatreProduction .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?production :hasName ?productionName . }
  
  OPTIONAL {
    ?production :productionOf ?play .
    ?play :hasTitle ?playTitle .
  }
  
  OPTIONAL { ?production :hasPremiereDate ?premiereDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of `:TheatreProduction`, optionally fetching their names (`:hasName`), the titles of the plays they're productions of (`:productionOf` and `:hasTitle`), and their premiere dates (`:hasPremiereDate`). 

By executing this query, you can find out when the premiere of a specific production occurred, provided that the production information is available in the data adhering to the given ontology.
