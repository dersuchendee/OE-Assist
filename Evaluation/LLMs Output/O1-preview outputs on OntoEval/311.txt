The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the classes and properties necessary to retrieve the premier date of a production through the `:hasPremier` and `:hasPremierDate` properties. Specifically, a `:Cl_Production` is linked to a `:Cl_ProductionPremier` via `:hasPremier`, and the premier date is captured by `:hasPremierDate`.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the premier date of each production:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
    ?production rdf:type :Cl_Production .
    ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
    ?premier :hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
}
```

This query selects all productions, their associated premiers, and the dates of those premiers, effectively answering the competency question.
