The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" can be answered using the ontology because it includes the class `:Cl_ProductionPremier`, which represents productions that have a premier date. This class has the `:hasPremierDate` property, allowing us to retrieve the premier date of a production.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the premier date of all productions that are instances of `:Cl_ProductionPremier`:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_ProductionPremier .
  ?production :hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
}
```

This query selects all productions that are classified as `:Cl_ProductionPremier` and retrieves their associated premier dates using the `:hasPremierDate` property.
