Answer: **Yes**

The ontology provides sufficient structure to answer the competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" since it includes classes and properties that relate a production to its premier date. Here is a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```

This query retrieves all productions along with their premier dates by navigating from the `Cl_Production` class to the `Cl_ProductionPremier` class via the `:hasPremier` object property and then retrieving the `:premierDate` data property.
