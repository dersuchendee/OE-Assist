**Answer: Yes**

The competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to represent productions and their premier dates. Specifically, a `:Cl_Production` is linked to a `:Cl_ProductionPremier` via the `:hasPremier` object property, and the `:Cl_ProductionPremier` class has a `:premierDate` datatype property storing the premiere date.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the premiere dates of productions:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```

This query selects all productions along with their labels (if available) and premiere dates.
