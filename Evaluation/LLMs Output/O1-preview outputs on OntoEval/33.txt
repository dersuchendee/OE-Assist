SELECT DISTINCT ?actor ?process
WHERE {
  ?participation a :CollaborationParticipation .
  ?participation :participatingActor ?actor .
  ?participation :participationIn ?process .
  ?process a process:Process .
}
```

This query selects all actors involved in processes by traversing the `:CollaborationParticipation` class, which links actors to processes via the properties `:participatingActor` and `:participationIn`. The `:Actor` class represents the actors, and `process:Process` represents the processes within a circular value network. The use of `DISTINCT` ensures that each actor-process pair is listed only once.
