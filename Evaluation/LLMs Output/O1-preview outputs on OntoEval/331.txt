The ontology supports the competency question since it contains the relevant classes and properties to represent productions, newspapers, reviews, and star ratings. Specifically, the properties `:hasReview`, `:isReviewedIn`, and `:starRating` connect a production and a newspaper through a review that includes the star rating.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the star rating given by a certain newspaper for a certain production:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?productionName ?newspaper ?newspaperName ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?newspaper a :Cl_Newspaper .
  
  ?production :isReviewedIn ?review .
  ?newspaper :hasReview ?review .
  
  ?review :starRating ?starRating .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?newspaper rdfs:label ?newspaperName . }
}
```

This query retrieves all productions and newspapers where the newspaper has reviewed the production and provides the associated star rating from the review.
