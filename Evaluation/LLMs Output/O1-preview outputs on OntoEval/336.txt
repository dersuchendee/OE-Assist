**No**

The ontology does not provide a way to associate a specific newspaper with its review and star rating for a certain production. The `:Cl_NewspaperReview` class is a subclass of `:Cl_Newspaper`, which makes it challenging to link a review to the newspaper that published it. There is no property in the ontology that connects a `:Cl_NewspaperReview` to a `:Cl_Newspaper`. Under the closed world assumption, we cannot infer this missing relationship.

However, we can extract the star ratings for productions without specifying the newspaper that gave them. Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the productions and their associated star ratings:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?review rdf:type :Cl_NewspaperReview .
  ?review :reviewsProduction ?production .
  ?review :hasStarRating ?starRating .
}
```
