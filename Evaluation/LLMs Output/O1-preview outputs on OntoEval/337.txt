**Yes**

Here, the CQ is answerable because the ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to represent productions, reviews, newspapers, and star ratings. The SPARQL query to extract the answer is:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?playTitle ?newspaperName ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :starRating ?starRating .
  ?review :reviewedBy ?newspaper .
  ?newspaper :hasName ?newspaperName .
  ?production :isBasedOn ?play .
  ?play :hasTitle ?playTitle .
}
```
