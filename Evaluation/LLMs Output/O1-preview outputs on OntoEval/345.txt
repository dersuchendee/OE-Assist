**No**

The CQ cannot be fully answered because there is no direct connection between a newspaper, a production, and the star rating in the ontology. Specifically, while we have the `:hasReview` property from `:Cl_Newspaper` to `:Cl_NewspaperReview`, and `:Cl_NewspaperReview` has a `:starRating`, there is no property connecting `:Cl_NewspaperReview` to a specific `:Cl_Production`. 

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer (star ratings given by newspapers, without linking to specific productions):

```sparql
SELECT ?newspaper ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?newspaper rdf:type :Cl_Newspaper .
  ?newspaper :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :starRating ?starRating .
}
```
