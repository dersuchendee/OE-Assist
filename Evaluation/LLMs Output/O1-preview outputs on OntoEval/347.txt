Answer: **Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?newspaper ?newspaperLabel ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
  ?production :reviews ?review .
  ?review a :Cl_ProductionReview .
  ?review :starRating ?starRating .
  ?review :reviewedBy ?newspaper .
  OPTIONAL { ?newspaper rdfs:label ?newspaperLabel . }
}
```

This SPARQL query retrieves the star ratings given by newspapers for productions. It queries for productions (`:Cl_Production`), their associated reviews (`:reviews`), the star ratings of those reviews (`:starRating`), and the newspapers that reviewed them (`:reviewedBy`). Optional labels for productions and newspapers are included for readability.
