Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?" is answerable using the given ontology. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to represent actors, theatres, employment periods, and start dates.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the actors, the theatres they started working at, and the start dates of their employment:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?theatre ?theatreName ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor rdf:type :Cl_Actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor :hasName ?actorName . }

  ?actor :op_hasEmploymentPeriod ?employmentPeriod .
  
  ?employmentPeriod :op_employmentIn ?theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre :hasName ?theatreName . }

  ?employmentPeriod :dp_startDate ?startDate .
}
```

This query selects all actors (`?actor`) along with their names (`?actorName`), the theatres they are employed at (`?theatre`) along with theatre names (`?theatreName`), and the start dates of their employment (`?startDate`).
