**Yes**

Because the ontology contains the necessary classes and properties to answer the competency question: we can retrieve actors, the theatres they are employed at, and the start date of their employment, as per the data provided.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a ns1:Actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
  ?actor ns1:employedAt ?theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel . }
  ?actor ns1:hasEmploymentContract ?contract .
  ?contract ns1:employmentStartDate ?startDate .
}
```
