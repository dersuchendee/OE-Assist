**Yes**

The ontology contains information about actors, their employment at theatres, and the start dates of their employment. Therefore, the competency question "At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?" can be answered using the ontology.

SELECT ?actorName ?theatreName ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor rdf:type theatre:Actor .
  ?actor rdfs:label ?actorName .
  ?actor theatre:hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment theatre:hasTheatre ?theatre .
  ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreName .
  ?employment theatre:hasStartDate ?startDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the actor's name, the theatre's name, and the start date of the actor's employment at the theatre.
