**Yes**

The competency question asks: "At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?" 

The ontology includes classes and properties that model actors, theatres, and employment relationships between them, with a start date. Specifically:

- **Classes**: `:Cl_Actor`, `:Cl_Theatre`, `:Cl_Employment`
- **Properties**:
  - `:hasActor` links an employment to an actor.
  - `:hasTheatre` links an employment to a theatre.
  - `:startDate` captures the start date of the employment.

Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the start date when a certain actor started working for a specific theatre.

```sparql
SELECT ?actorName ?theatreName ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor rdf:type :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :name ?actorName .
  ?theatre rdf:type :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :name ?theatreName .
  ?employment rdf:type :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :hasActor ?actor .
  ?employment :hasTheatre ?theatre .
  ?employment :startDate ?startDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the names of actors and theatres, along with the start date of employment, allowing us to answer the competency question.
