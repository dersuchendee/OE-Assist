SELECT ?actorName ?theatreName ?startDate

  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment .

This query retrieves the start dates when actors started working at specific theatres by leveraging the `:Cl_ActorEmployment` class, which connects `:Cl_Actor`, `:Cl_Theatre`, and the `:startDate`. The properties `:employedActor`, `:atTheatre`, and `:startDate` allow us to extract the required information directly, fulfilling the competency question.
