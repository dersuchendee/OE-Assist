**No**

Because the ontology does not provide a way to link an actual actor instance (of class `:Cl_Actor`) to the `:Cl_ActorEmployment` instances representing their employment events. Therefore, we cannot retrieve the starting employment dates of specific actors at particular theatres.

Partial SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?actorEmployment ?theatre ?employmentDate WHERE {
  ?actorEmployment rdf:type :Cl_ActorEmployment .
  ?actorEmployment :worksForTheatre ?theatre .
  ?actorEmployment :hasEmploymentDate ?employmentDate .
}
```
