Answer: **Yes**

Because the ontology includes ActorEmployment instances that connect actors to theatres, with start dates, the competency question can be answered using the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?theatre ?theatreName ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?employment rdf:type :Cl_ActorEmployment .
  ?employment :employmentActor ?actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorName . }
  ?employment :employedAt ?theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreName . }
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
}
```
