**Yes**

The CQ is answerable since the ontology includes the class `:Cl_ActorEmployment`, which connects actors to theatres via employment with a start date.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?actorName ?theatreName ?startDateValue
WHERE {
    ?employment rdf:type :Cl_ActorEmployment .
    ?employment :hasActor ?actor .
    ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
    ?employment :hasTheatre ?theatre .
    ?theatre :theatreName ?theatreName .
    ?employment :hasStartDate ?startDate .
    ?startDate :festivalDate ?startDateValue .
}
```
