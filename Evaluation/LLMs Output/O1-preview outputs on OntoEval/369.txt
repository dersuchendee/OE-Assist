**Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to represent the relationships between actors (`:Cl_Person`), theatres (`:Cl_Theatre`), and the employment start date (`:employmentStartDate`). Specifically:

- `:employedAt` is an object property that connects a person to a theatre (`rdfs:domain :Cl_Person ; rdfs:range :Cl_Theatre`).
- `:employmentStartDate` is a datatype property that captures the date when the person started working (`rdfs:domain :Cl_Person ; rdfs:range xsd:date`).

Here's the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :employedAt ?theatre .
  ?person :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
}
```

This query retrieves all persons who are employed at a theatre and their corresponding employment start dates, thus answering the competency question: "At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?"
