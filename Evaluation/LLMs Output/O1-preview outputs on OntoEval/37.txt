Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "What are the actors involved in the process?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology defines the classes `:Process` and `:Actor`, and the object property `:involvesActor` that relates a process to the actors involved in it. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the processes and their associated actors.

Here is the SPARQL query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/circular_value_network#>

SELECT ?process ?processLabel ?actor ?actorLabel
WHERE {
  ?process a :Process .
  OPTIONAL { ?process rdfs:label ?processLabel . }
  ?process :involvesActor ?actor .
  ?actor a :Actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of `:Process` and their associated `:Actor` instances through the `:involvesActor` property. It also optionally retrieves any labels associated with the processes and actors for more informative results.
