**Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to retrieve the employment start date of an actor working for a specific theatre. The `Cl_Theatre` class is connected to the `Cl_Employment` class via the `employs` object property. The `Cl_Employment` class is connected to the `Cl_Actor` class via the `employedActor` object property, and it has an `employmentStartDate` data property. This allows us to traverse from a theatre to an actor and retrieve the start date of their employment.

```sparql
SELECT ?theatre ?theatreName ?actor ?actorName ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreName . }
  
  ?theatre :employs ?employment .
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
  
  ?employment :employedActor ?actor .
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorName . }
}
```
