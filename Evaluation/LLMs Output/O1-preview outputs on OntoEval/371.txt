**No**

The ontology does not fully model the competency question. While it defines the classes and reification for modeling an actor's employment at a theatre with a start date, it lacks the necessary object properties to connect an employment instance to a specific theatre. Specifically, there is no property linking the `Cl_Employment` class to the `Cl_Theatre` class directly or indirectly. Thus, we cannot retrieve the theatre associated with an actor's employment.

However, we can extract partial information about actors and their employment start dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?actorName ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor :actorName ?actorName . }
  
  ?actor :isEmployedAt ?employment .
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
}
```

This query retrieves actors and their employment start dates but does not provide information about the specific theatres they started working for.
