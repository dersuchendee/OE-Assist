The given ontology does not fully support the Competency Question "What roles does a certain person have within a certain production at a certain point in time?". Specifically, the ontology lacks a direct connection between the `theatre:Role` and the `theatre:Production`. While we know that an `Actor` has a `Role` and participates in a `Production`, there is no explicit linkage between the `Role` and the `Production`. Additionally, time-specific information (i.e., the point in time when the actor played the role in the production) is not modeled in the ontology. Therefore, we cannot write a SPARQL query to fully answer the CQ, but the provided query extracts partial information about actors, their roles, and the productions they participate in.
