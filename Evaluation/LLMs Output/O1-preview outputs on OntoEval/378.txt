```sparql
SELECT ?role ?roleLabel
WHERE {
  # Find role assignments involving the specific person and production
  ?roleAssignment a :RoleAssignment ;
                  :assignedPerson ?person ;
                  :assignedRole ?role ;
                  :inProduction ?production ;
                  :during ?timeInterval .
  
  # Get labels for roles (optional)
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel . }
  
  # Get the start and end dates of the time interval
  ?timeInterval :hasStartDate ?startDate ;
                :hasEndDate ?endDate .
                
  # Filter to include only the role assignments valid at the specified time point
  FILTER (?timePoint >= ?startDate && ?timePoint <= ?endDate) .
}
```

This query retrieves the roles (`?role`) that a specific person (`?person`) has within a specific production (`?production`) at a specific point in time (`?timePoint`). It does so by:

- Finding role assignments (`:RoleAssignment`) that involve the person and production of interest.
- Ensuring the time interval during which the role assignment is valid includes the specified time point.
- Optionally retrieving labels for the roles for readability.

This utilizes the ontology's modeling of `RoleAssignment`, which relates a person, role, production, and time interval, allowing us to answer the competency question.
