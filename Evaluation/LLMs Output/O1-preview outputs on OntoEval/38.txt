```

The competency question "What actors hold this information?" is answerable using the ontology because it models the relationships between actors and information resources. Specifically, the ontology defines `actorODP:ResourceRelation` to represent the participation of an actor (`actorODP:participatingActor`) with a certain role (`actorODP:participantRole`) in relation to a resource (`actorODP:participatingResource`). By querying for actors who have the role of `actor:owner` and are related to resources of type `resourceODP:Information`, we can retrieve the actors that hold (own) the information.
