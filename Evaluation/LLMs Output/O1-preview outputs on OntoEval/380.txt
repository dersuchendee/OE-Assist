Answer: **Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that model the relationships between persons, roles, productions, and time. Specifically, the `:Cl_PersonRoleInProductionAtTime` class acts as a pivot that connects a person to the roles they have within a production at a specific point in time.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the roles a certain person has within a certain production at a certain point in time:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?roleLabel
WHERE {
  # Specify the person of interest
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          rdfs:label "Person Name" ;
          :hasPersonRoleInProductionAtTime ?pript .

  # Link to the pivot class
  ?pript a :Cl_PersonRoleInProductionAtTime ;
         :hasRole ?role ;
         :partOfProductionAtTime ?pat .

  # Retrieve role information
  ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel .

  # Link to the production at time
  ?pat a :Cl_ProductionAtTime ;
       :hasProduction ?production ;
       :hasTime ?time .

  # Specify the production and time of interest
  ?production rdfs:label "Production Name" .
  FILTER(?time = "YYYY-MM-DD"^^xsd:date)
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Person Selection:** The query begins by selecting a specific person using their label (replace `"Person Name"` with the actual name).
  
- **Navigating Relationships:**
  - `:hasPersonRoleInProductionAtTime` links the person to the `:Cl_PersonRoleInProductionAtTime` pivot class.
  - Within this pivot class, `:hasRole` obtains the roles associated with the person.
  - `:partOfProductionAtTime` connects the pivot class to the `:Cl_ProductionAtTime`, which combines the production and the time.
  
- **Production and Time Filtering:**
  - The production is specified by its label (replace `"Production Name"` with the actual production name).
  - The time is filtered to match the specific point in time of interest (replace `"YYYY-MM-DD"` with the actual date).

- **Retrieving Role Information:**
  - The role's label is retrieved to provide meaningful output.

**Note:** Ensure that the ontology contains the necessary individuals (`:Cl_Person`, `:Cl_Production`, roles, and time instances) with appropriate labels and connections as per the ontology's structure.
