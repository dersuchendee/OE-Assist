**No**

The given ontology lacks the necessary connections to fully answer the competency question. Specifically, there is no property linking an actor's role to a specific production at a certain point in time. However, we can extract partial information about the roles actors have in plays along with the dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorRole ?play ?roleDate
WHERE {
  ?actorRoleInstance a :Cl_ActorRole .
  ?actorRoleInstance :hasRole ?play .
  ?actorRoleInstance :hasRoleDate ?roleDate .
  
  # Since Cl_ActorRole is a subclass of Cl_Actor, we can infer that instances are actors.
  # However, there is no direct property linking actorRoleInstance to an actor.
  # Therefore, we cannot retrieve the actor directly unless more information is provided.

  # Optionally, if there's a property linking actor roles to actors, it would be included here.
  # For example:
  # ?actorRoleInstance :performedBy ?actor .
}
```

This query retrieves actor roles, the plays they are associated with, and the dates of those roles. However, without a direct link between actors and productions in the ontology, we cannot determine the roles a certain person has within a certain production at a certain point in time.
