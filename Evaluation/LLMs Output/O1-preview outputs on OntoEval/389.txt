**No**

The competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology because it lacks instances and relationships that link actors to their specific roles within productions at certain times. Specifically, there are no instances of `:Cl_ActorRole` that would connect an actor, a production, a role, and a time period.

However, we can extract partial information about actors and their participation in ensembles, although we cannot determine the roles they played or the specific productions at certain times.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract partial information:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?ensemble ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?ensembleMembership rdf:type :Cl_EnsembleMembership ;
                      :hasMember ?actor ;
                      :hasEnsemble ?ensemble ;
                      :hasTimePeriod ?date .
  ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
  ?date :festivalDate ?timePeriod .
}
```

This query retrieves actors, their names, the ensembles they are part of, and the time periods of their membership. Due to missing links between ensembles and productions, as well as absent role information, we cannot provide details about the roles actors have within specific productions at certain times.
