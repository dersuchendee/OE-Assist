**No**

The ontology does not fully support the competency question because there is no explicit connection between the `Cl_ProductionRole` and a specific `Cl_Production` individual. While `Cl_ProductionRole` is a subclass of both `Cl_Person` and `Cl_Production`, there isn't an object property linking a `Cl_ProductionRole` instance to a separate `Cl_Production` instance. Therefore, we cannot retrieve the roles a person has within a certain production at a certain point in time. 

However, we can extract a partial answer by retrieving the roles a person has and the dates, but without the specific production information.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?roleName ?roleDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasRoleInProduction ?productionRole .
  ?productionRole a :Cl_ProductionRole .
  ?productionRole :roleName ?roleName .
  ?productionRole :roleDate ?roleDate .
}
```
