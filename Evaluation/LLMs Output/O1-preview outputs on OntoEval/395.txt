**No**

The competency question cannot be fully answered by the ontology because there is no explicit connection between the role assignment and a specific production at a certain point in time. The ontology lacks an object property linking the `:Cl_RoleAssignment` to a `:Cl_Production` instance in a way that satisfies the CQ requirements.

However, we can extract a partial answer about the roles a person has and the dates, without explicitly associating them with a particular production.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?roleName ?roleDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasRoleInProduction ?roleAssignment .
  
  ?roleAssignment a :Cl_RoleAssignment .
  ?roleAssignment :roleName ?roleName .
  ?roleAssignment :roleDate ?roleDate .
}
```
