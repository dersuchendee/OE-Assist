Answer: **Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology, as it models that a production has exactly one premiere through a cardinality restriction on the `:hasPremiere` property in the definition of the `:Production` class.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the classes which have a cardinality restriction of exactly one on the `:hasPremiere` property:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?productionClass ?cardinality
WHERE {
  ?productionClass rdfs:subClassOf [
    a owl:Restriction ;
    owl:onProperty :hasPremiere ;
    owl:cardinality ?cardinality
  ] .
  FILTER(?cardinality = "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger)
}
```

This query will return the `:Production` class along with the cardinality "1", confirming that according to the ontology, each production has exactly one premiere.
