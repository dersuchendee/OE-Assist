**Answer: No**

There is insufficient information in the ontology to fully answer the competency question "What is the type of this actor?" because there are no individuals of type `actorODP:Actor` or any associations between actors and their types defined in the ontology. Under the closed-world assumption, without any instances or data linking actors to their types, we cannot extract the required information.

However, we can provide a partial SPARQL query that would retrieve actor types if such data were available:

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorType
WHERE {
  ?actor rdf:type actorODP:Actor .
  ?actor actorODP:actorType ?actorType .
}
```

This query attempts to select all actors and their corresponding types by querying for instances of `actorODP:Actor` and their `actorODP:actorType`. If the ontology contained individuals of actors and their types, this query would retrieve that information.
