Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is supported by the ontology. The ontology defines the class `:Cl_Production` and the object property `:hasPremier`, with a cardinality restriction specifying that each production has exactly one premier. This is expressed in the ontology with the following axioms:

```ttl
:Cl_Production a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf [
        a owl:Restriction ;
        owl:onProperty :hasPremier ;
        owl:cardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger
    ] .

:hasPremier a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Cl_Production ;
    rdfs:range :Cl_Premier .
```

Given this, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve all productions and their associated premier:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premier
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
}
```

This query will return all instances of `:Cl_Production` and their corresponding `:hasPremier`, satisfying the competency question.
