**Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premiere
WHERE {
  ?production rdf:type :TheatreProduction .
  ?production :hasPremiere ?premiere .
}
```

The ontology specifies that every `:TheatreProduction` has exactly one `:hasPremiere` property due to the cardinality restriction:

```ttl
:TheatreProduction rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf 
        :Event ,
        [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
          owl:onProperty :hasPremiere ;
          owl:cardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger
        ] ;
    rdfs:label "Theatre Production"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "A specific staging or performance of a play, which has exactly one premiere."@en .
```

Under the closed world assumption, we can query all productions and their associated premiere using the SPARQL query above. The query retrieves all instances of `:TheatreProduction` along with their corresponding `:Premiere`. Since the ontology enforces that each production must have exactly one premiere, the query effectively answers the competency question.
