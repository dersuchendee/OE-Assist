**No**

The ontology does not specify that each production has exactly one premier. We can retrieve productions and their associated premieres, but we cannot confirm that a production has exactly one premier due to the missing cardinality restriction from `:Cl_Production` to `:Cl_ProductionPremier`. Here's a partial SPARQL query to retrieve productions and their premieres:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?production ?premier
WHERE {
    ?premier rdf:type :Cl_ProductionPremier .
    ?premier :premierOf ?production .
}
```
