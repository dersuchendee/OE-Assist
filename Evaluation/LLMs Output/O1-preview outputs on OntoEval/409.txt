Answer: **Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?production
WHERE {
  ?production rdf:type :Cl_Production .
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)
```

In this query, we retrieve all instances of `:Cl_Production` and count the number of `:hasPremier` relationships they have. Under the closed world assumption, since the ontology specifies exactly one `:hasPremier` for each production, we conclude that each production has exactly one premier.
