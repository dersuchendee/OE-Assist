**Answer: Yes**

The competency question "A production has exactly one premier" is modeled in the ontology. The class `:Cl_Production` is defined with a qualified cardinality constraint indicating that each production has exactly one premier. This is represented in the ontology with the following restriction:

```ttl
:Cl_Production rdf:type rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf [
        rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
        owl:onProperty :hasPremier ;
        owl:qualifiedCardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
        owl:onClass :Cl_ProductionPremier
    ] .
```

This means every instance of `:Cl_Production` must have exactly one `:hasPremier` relationship to an instance of `:Cl_ProductionPremier`.

**SPARQL Query:**

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
    ?production rdf:type :Cl_Production .
    ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
    ?premier :hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
}
```

This query retrieves all productions and their associated premier dates, confirming that each production has exactly one premier as specified in the ontology.
