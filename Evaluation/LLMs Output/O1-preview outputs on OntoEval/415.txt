**No**

The ontology does not enforce that a production has exactly one premier due to the absence of cardinality constraints on the `:hasPremier` property. Therefore, we cannot confirm that a production has exactly one premier using this ontology.

However, we can extract productions and their premiers (if any) using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production rdf:type :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```

This query retrieves productions and their associated premier dates but does not verify the exact cardinality of premiers per production.
