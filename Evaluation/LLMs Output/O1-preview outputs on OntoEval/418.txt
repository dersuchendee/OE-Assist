**No**

The ontology provides information about productions and their premiers through the `:hasPremier` property and the `:Cl_ProductionPremier` class. However, it does not specify that a production has **exactly one** premierâ€”there are no cardinality constraints (like `owl:cardinality 1`) on the `:hasPremier` property. Under the closed-world assumption, we cannot conclude that each production has exactly one premier based solely on the ontology.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract the productions and their premier dates:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```

This query retrieves productions and their associated premier dates, but it does not confirm that there is exactly one premier per production.
