**No**

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?name ?bandName
WHERE {
  ?band a :Cl_MusicGroup ;
        :hasMember ?person ;
        :hasName ?bandName .
  ?person a :Cl_Musician ;
          :hasName ?name .
}
```

The ontology does not include information about which instruments a person plays. The property connecting persons to instruments (`:playsInstrument`) or an instrument class (`:Cl_Instrument`) is not present in the ontology. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question "What instruments does a certain person play?" However, we can extract partial information about musicians and the music groups they are members of.
