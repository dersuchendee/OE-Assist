Answer: **Yes**

The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to answer the competency question. The `:Cl_Person` class represents persons, the `:Cl_Instrument` class represents instruments, and the `:playsInstrument` object property connects persons to the instruments they play.

Here is the SPARQL query to retrieve the instruments that a certain person plays:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?instrument ?instrumentName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personName . }
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentName . }
}
```

This query selects all persons of type `:Cl_Person` and retrieves the instruments they play via the `:playsInstrument` property. It also attempts to get labels for the persons and instruments if available.
