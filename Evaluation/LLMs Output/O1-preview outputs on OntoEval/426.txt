The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to answer the competency question "What instruments does a certain person play?" Specifically, the `:plays` object property connects individuals of class `:Cl_Person` to `:Cl_Instrument`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the instruments played by a specific person.

Here's an example SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?instrumentName
WHERE {
  :PersonName a :Cl_Person .
  :PersonName :plays ?instrument .
  ?instrument :instrumentName ?instrumentName .
}
```

Replace `:PersonName` with the specific individual's URI (e.g., `:Flea`, `:JohnFrusciante`, etc.). This query retrieves the names of the instruments played by the specified person.

If you want to list all persons and the instruments they play, you can use:

```sparql
SELECT ?personName ?instrumentName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :name ?personName .
  ?person :plays ?instrument .
  ?instrument :instrumentName ?instrumentName .
}
```

This query returns a list of all individuals and the instruments they play.
