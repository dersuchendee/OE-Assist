The competency question "What instruments does a certain person play?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to represent persons, instruments, and the relationship between them through the class `Cl_InstrumentPlaying`. Here's how:

- `Cl_Person` represents persons.
- `Cl_Instrument` represents instruments.
- `Cl_InstrumentPlaying` acts as a reified association between `Cl_Person` and `Cl_Instrument`.
- The property `playsInstrument` connects a person to an instance of `Cl_InstrumentPlaying`.
- The property `playedBy` connects an instrument to the same instance of `Cl_InstrumentPlaying`.

Using these classes and properties, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the instruments played by each person.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?instrument ?instrumentName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personName . }
  
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrumentPlaying .
  ?instrumentPlaying a :Cl_InstrumentPlaying .
  
  ?instrumentPlaying :playedBy ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentName . }
}
```

This query performs the following steps:

1. Selects all instances of `Cl_Person`.
2. Connects each person to their `Cl_InstrumentPlaying` instance via `playsInstrument`.
3. From the `Cl_InstrumentPlaying` instance, retrieves the associated instrument via `playedBy`.
4. Optionally retrieves labels (`rdfs:label`) for persons and instruments for readability.

**Explanation:**

- The use of `Cl_InstrumentPlaying` as an intermediary class allows us to model the relationship between persons and instruments flexibly. It can accommodate additional details about the instrument playing event if needed (e.g., duration, proficiency level).
- The properties `playsInstrument` and `playedBy` establish the necessary connections to navigate from a person to the instruments they play.

**Note:** Ensure that your data includes instances of these classes and properties to retrieve meaningful results when running the query.
