Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "What is the type of this actor?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `:hasActorType` property, which associates an `:Actor` with its `:ActorType`. Since each actor is modeled to have at least one actor type (as specified by the cardinality restriction in the ontology), we can retrieve the actor's type using a SPARQL query.

Here's the SPARQL query to extract the actor's type:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/circular_value_network.owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?actorType ?actorTypeLabel
WHERE {
  :thisActor a :Actor ;
      :hasActorType ?actorType .
  OPTIONAL { ?actorType rdfs:label ?actorTypeLabel . }
}
```

In this query:
- Replace `:thisActor` with the actual URI of the actor you're inquiring about.
- The query retrieves the `?actorType` associated with the actor via the `:hasActorType` property.
- The optional `?actorTypeLabel` provides a human-readable label if available.
