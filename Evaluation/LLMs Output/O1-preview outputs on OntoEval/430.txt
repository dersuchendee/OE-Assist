**Yes**

The CQ "What instruments does a certain person play?" is answerable since the ontology includes the `:playsInstrument` property linking individuals of class `:Cl_Person` to individuals of class `:Cl_Instrument`. The ontology contains data about people and the instruments they play.

Here's the SPARQL query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}
```

If you want to find the instruments played by a specific person, you can specify the person, for example:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?instrument
WHERE {
  :John_Frusciante :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}
```
