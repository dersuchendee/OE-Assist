Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "What instruments does a certain person play?" is supported by the ontology. This is because the ontology includes:

- Individuals of type `:Cl_Person`, such as `:Anthony_Kiedis`, `:Flea`, `:John_Frusciante`, and `:Chad_Smith`.
- Individuals of type `:Cl_Instrument`, such as `:Vocals`, `:Bass`, `:Trumpet`, `:Keyboards`, `:Guitar`, and `:Drums`.
- An object property `:playsInstrument` that links persons to the instruments they play.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the instruments played by each person:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}
```

If you want to find the instruments played by a specific person, replace `?person` with the individual's URI. For example, to find the instruments played by `:Flea`:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?instrument
WHERE {
  :Flea :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}
```

This query will return all instruments that `:Flea` plays, as defined in the ontology.
