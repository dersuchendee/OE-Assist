**Yes**

The competency question can be answered because the ontology contains the `:playsInstrument` property, which relates instances of `:Cl_Person` to instances of `:Cl_Instrument`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the instruments played by a certain person.

To find the instruments that a specific person plays (e.g., `:AnthonyKiedis`), you can use the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?instrument
WHERE {
  :AnthonyKiedis :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}
```

If you want to parameterize the query for any person, you can use:

```sparql
SELECT ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  FILTER (?person = :PersonX)
}
```

Replace `:PersonX` with the URI of the person you're interested in.

Alternatively, to get all persons and the instruments they play, you can use:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}
```

This query will return all instances of `:Cl_Person` and the instruments they play according to the ontology.
