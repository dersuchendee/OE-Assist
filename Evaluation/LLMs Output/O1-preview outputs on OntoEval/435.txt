Answer: **Yes**

```sparql

SELECT ?instrument
WHERE {
  :CertainPerson :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}
```

Replace `:CertainPerson` with the actual person you're interested in, for example `:JohnFrusciante`.

This query retrieves the instruments that a certain person plays by querying the triples where the person is connected to instruments via the `:playsInstrument` property.
