Answer: **Yes**.

Because the ontology includes the classes `:Cl_Person` and `:Cl_Instrument`, and the object property `:playsInstrument`, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the instruments played by each person.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}
```
