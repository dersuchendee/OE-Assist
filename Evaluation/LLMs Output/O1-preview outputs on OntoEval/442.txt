**Answer: Yes**

The competency question can be answered because the ontology includes classes and properties that represent band memberships with start and end dates. This allows us to determine the members of a particular band at a specific point in time.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?personName ?role
WHERE {
  # Find persons and their memberships
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?membership :hasMembership ?band .
  
  # Band name filter (replace "BAND_NAME" with the desired band)
  ?band :hasName ?bandName .
  FILTER(STR(?bandName) = "BAND_NAME") .
  
  # Get membership start and end dates
  ?membership :membershipStart ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?endDate . }
  
  # Person's name and role (if available)
  OPTIONAL { ?person :hasName ?personName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :hasRole ?role . }
  
  # Date filter (replace "TARGET_DATE" with the desired date)
  FILTER(
    xsd:date(?startDate) <= xsd:date("TARGET_DATE") &&
    (
      !bound(?endDate) || xsd:date(?endDate) >= xsd:date("TARGET_DATE")
    )
  )
}
```

- Replace `"BAND_NAME"` with the name of the band you're interested in (e.g., `"Red Hot Chili Peppers"`).
- Replace `"TARGET_DATE"` with the date you're querying (e.g., `"2006-05-05"`).

This query retrieves all persons who were members of the specified band on the given date, along with their roles if available.
