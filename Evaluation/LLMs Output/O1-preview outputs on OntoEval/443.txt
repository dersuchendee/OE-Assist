Answer: **No**

Because the ontology does not contain specific time data for the membership intervals, we cannot determine the members of a particular band at a specific point in time.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the partial answer (members of a band, regardless of time):

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX time: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#>

SELECT ?bandName ?memberName
WHERE {
  ?band rdf:type :Band .
  OPTIONAL { ?band rdfs:label ?bandName . }
  
  ?membership rdf:type :Membership ;
              :membershipInBand ?band ;
              :membershipTime ?timeInterval .
              
  ?member rdf:type :Musician ;
          :hasName ?memberName ;
          :memberOf ?membership .
}
```

This query retrieves the members of each band but cannot filter by a specific point in time due to the lack of detailed time interval data in the ontology.
