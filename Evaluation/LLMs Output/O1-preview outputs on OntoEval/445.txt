The Competency Question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" is answerable with the given ontology. The ontology models band memberships using `ns1:BandMembership`, which associates a `ns1:Person` with a `ns1:Band` and includes temporal information about the membership period through `ns1:memberDuring` and time intervals.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the members of a given band at a specified date:

```sparql
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX time: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?role ?instrument
WHERE {
  # Specify the band and the date here
  BIND(ns1:RedHotChiliPeppers AS ?band)
  BIND("2006-08-11"^^xsd:date AS ?date)
  
  ?person ns1:hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership a ns1:BandMembership .
  ?membership ns1:membershipInBand ?band .
  ?membership ns1:memberDuring ?timeInterval .
  ?timeInterval ns1:hasBeginDate ?beginDate .
  ?timeInterval ns1:hasEndDate ?endDate .
  
  FILTER (?beginDate <= ?date && ?date <= ?endDate) .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?person ns1:hasRole ?role . }
  OPTIONAL { ?person ns1:playsInstrument ?instrument . }
}
```

This query returns all the persons who were members of the specified band (`?band`) during the given date (`?date`). Replace `ns1:RedHotChiliPeppers` and `"2006-08-11"^^xsd:date` with the desired band and date to retrieve the relevant members.
