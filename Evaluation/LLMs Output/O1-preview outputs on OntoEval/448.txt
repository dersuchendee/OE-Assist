Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" is answerable using the given ontology. The ontology models band memberships over time through the `BandMembership` class, which relates `Person`, `Band`, `Role`, and `TimeInterval`. Each `BandMembership` instance includes a member, the band they are part of, the role they play, and the time interval during which they are active in the band.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the members of a specific band at a given date:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?member ?memberName ?roleName
WHERE {
  # Specify the band name
  ?band a :Band ;
        rdfs:label ?bandName .
  FILTER ( ?bandName = "Red Hot Chili Peppers" )  # Replace with the desired band name

  # Retrieve band memberships associated with the band
  ?bandMembership :hasBand ?band ;
                  :involvesMember ?member ;
                  :hasRole ?role ;
                  :hasTimeInterval ?ti .

  # Get the time interval of the membership
  ?ti :startDate ?startDate ;
      :endDate ?endDate .

  # Specify the date of interest
  BIND ( "2006-08-11"^^xsd:date AS ?date )  # Replace with the desired date

  # Check if the date falls within the membership interval
  FILTER ( ?startDate <= ?date && ?date <= ?endDate )

  # Get member and role names
  ?member rdfs:label ?memberName .
  ?role rdfs:label ?roleName .
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Prefixes**: We declare the necessary prefixes for the ontology and XML Schema datatypes.
- **Band Selection**: We select the band of interest by filtering on its name.
- **Band Memberships**: We find all `BandMembership` instances associated with the band, involving members, roles, and time intervals.
- **Time Interval Filtering**: We specify the date of interest and filter memberships whose time intervals include this date.
- **Result Variables**: We retrieve the names of the members and their roles during that time.

**Usage**:

- Replace `"Red Hot Chili Peppers"` in the `FILTER` clause with the name of the band you're interested in.
- Replace `"2006-08-11"^^xsd:date` in the `BIND` clause with the date you're querying for.

This query will return all members of the specified band who were active on the given date, along with the roles they played in the band at that time.
