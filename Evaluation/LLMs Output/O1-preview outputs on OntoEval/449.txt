The competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology models the membership of persons in bands over time through the `:Cl_Membership` class, which includes `:startDate` and `:endDate` properties. This allows us to query for members of a band at a specific point in time.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the members of a specific band at a given date:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?member ?memberName
WHERE {
  # Input parameters:
  # Replace :SpecificBand with the band you're interested in
  # Replace "YYYY-MM-DD"^^xsd:date with the specific date

  :SpecificBand a :Cl_Band .

  ?membership a :Cl_Membership .
  ?membership :memberOf :SpecificBand .
  ?membership :member ?member .
  ?membership :startDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :endDate ?endDate . }

  ?member a :Cl_Person .
  ?member :name ?memberName .

  FILTER (
    xsd:date(?startDate) <= "YYYY-MM-DD"^^xsd:date &&
    (
      !bound(?endDate) || "YYYY-MM-DD"^^xsd:date <= xsd:date(?endDate)
    )
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Prefixes**: We declare the necessary prefixes for the ontology and XML schema datatypes.
- **Input Parameters**:
  - Replace `:SpecificBand` with the URI of the band you're querying (e.g., `:RedHotChiliPeppers`).
  - Replace `"YYYY-MM-DD"^^xsd:date` with the specific date you're interested in (e.g., `"2006-05-05"^^xsd:date`).
- **Query Structure**:
  - We select the `?member` (person URI) and their `?memberName`.
  - We ensure that `:SpecificBand` is a band in the ontology.
  - We find `?membership` instances where the membership is associated with the specific band and a member.
  - We retrieve the start and optional end dates of the membership.
  - We get the name of the member using the `:name` property.
- **Filter Condition**:
  - We check that the `?startDate` is on or before the specified date.
  - We also check that the `?endDate` is either not bound (membership is ongoing) or the specified date is on or before the `?endDate`.
  - This ensures that we only get members who were part of the band at the specified point in time.

**Example Usage:**

To find the members of the "Red Hot Chili Peppers" on May 5, 2006, you would replace `:SpecificBand` with `:RedHotChiliPeppers` and `"YYYY-MM-DD"^^xsd:date` with `"2006-05-05"^^xsd:date`:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?member ?memberName
WHERE {
  :RedHotChiliPeppers a :Cl_Band .

  ?membership a :Cl_Membership .
  ?membership :memberOf :RedHotChiliPeppers .
  ?membership :member ?member .
  ?membership :startDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :endDate ?endDate . }

  ?member a :Cl_Person .
  ?member :name ?memberName .

  FILTER (
    xsd:date(?startDate) <= "2006-05-05"^^xsd:date &&
    (
      !bound(?endDate) || "2006-05-05"^^xsd:date <= xsd:date(?endDate)
    )
  )
}
```

This query will return all members who were part of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on May 5, 2006, according to the data modeled in the ontology.
