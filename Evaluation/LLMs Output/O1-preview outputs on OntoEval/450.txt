**No**

The ontology does not provide time-dependent relationships between persons, their roles, and bands. While we can retrieve the roles a person has in a band, we cannot specify the point in time when they had that role. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question as it requires temporal information about roles.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer without the time component:

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?personName ?bandName ?roleLabel
WHERE {
  ?person rdf:type ex:Person ;
          ex:hasName ?personName ;
          ex:hasRole ?role .
  ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel .
  ?band rdf:type ex:Band ;
        ex:hasMember ?person .
  OPTIONAL { ?band rdfs:label ?bandName . }
}
```

This query retrieves the roles a person has within a band but lacks the temporal aspect required to fully answer the competency question.
