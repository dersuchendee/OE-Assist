Answer: **No**

The ontology lacks sufficient information about the time periods to determine band members at a specific point in time. Specifically, the `Cl_TimePeriod` class does not have properties defining start and end dates, so we cannot compare a given date to the membership periods.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer (listing band members and their associated membership periods without the ability to filter by a specific date):

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?membershipPeriod
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOfBand ?membership .
  ?membership :bandMember ?band .
  ?membership :membershipPeriod ?membershipPeriod .
}
```
