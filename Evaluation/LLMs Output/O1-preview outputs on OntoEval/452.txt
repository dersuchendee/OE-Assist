**No**

We cannot fully answer the competency question because the ontology lacks properties to specify the start and end dates of a `Cl_TimePeriod`. Without these, we cannot determine if a band member was active at a specific point in time. However, we can retrieve the band members and their associated time periods.

```sparql
SELECT ?band ?member ?membershipPeriod
WHERE {
  ?bandMembership a :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?bandMembership :memberOf ?member .
  ?bandMembership :hasMember ?band .
  ?bandMembership :membershipPeriod ?membershipPeriod .
}
```
