Answer: **No**.

The ontology does not allow us to determine the members of a band at a specific point in time, because there is no link between the `:Cl_Membership` instances (which have membership dates) and the `:Cl_Person` individuals (the band members). Without a property connecting `:Cl_Membership` to `:Cl_Person`, we cannot retrieve the members active in the band at a given date.

However, we can retrieve partial information about the members of the band without considering the time aspect.

```sparql
SELECT ?person
WHERE {
  ?person rdf:type :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf :Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers .
}
```
