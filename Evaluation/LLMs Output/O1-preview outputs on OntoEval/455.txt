**No**

The ontology provides information about band members and the start times of their memberships through the `:atTime` property, but it does not include the end times of memberships. Without the end times, we cannot determine whether a person was a member of a band at a specific point in time. Therefore, the competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" is not fully supported by the ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer (members and their membership start times):

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_BandMembership ;
              :membershipInBand :Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers ;
              :hasMember ?person ;
              :atTime ?membershipTime .
}
```
