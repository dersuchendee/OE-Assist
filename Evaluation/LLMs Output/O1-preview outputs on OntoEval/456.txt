**Yes**

The competency question "Which tracks are contained in the album 'Stadium Arcadium'?" is supported by the ontology, as the property `:containsTrack` links albums to tracks.

Here is the SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?track
WHERE {
  :StadiumArcadium :containsTrack ?track .
}
```

If you also want to retrieve the songs that each track is a recording of, you can use the following query:

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  :StadiumArcadium :containsTrack ?track .
  OPTIONAL { ?track :isRecordingOf ?song . }
}
```
