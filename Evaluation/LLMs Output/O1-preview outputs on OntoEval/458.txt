Answer: **Yes**

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the members of a specified band at a certain point in time:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?member ?memberName ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_BandMembership ;
              :memberOf :RedHotChiliPeppers ;
              :hasMember ?member ;
              :membershipTime ?membershipTime .
  
  FILTER (?membershipTime <= "YOUR_DATETIME_HERE"^^xsd:dateTime)
  
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberName . }
}
ORDER BY ?membershipTime
```

Replace `"YOUR_DATETIME_HERE"` with the specific date and time you're interested in, formatted according to `xsd:dateTime`. For example, to find the members as of January 1, 1990, use `"1990-01-01T00:00:00"`.

This query works under the **closed world assumption**, meaning it assumes that if there is no information indicating a member has left the band, they are still considered a member after their `:membershipTime`. Since the ontology does not contain information about membership end dates, we select all members who joined on or before the specified date.

**Explanation:**

- The query looks for instances of `:Cl_BandMembership` where:
  - The band is `:RedHotChiliPeppers`.
  - The membership started on or before the specified date.
- It retrieves the member (`?member`), their name (`?memberName`), and the membership start time (`?membershipTime`).
- The `OPTIONAL` clause attempts to get the member's label if it exists.
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by the membership start time.
