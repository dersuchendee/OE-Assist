Answer: **No**

The competency question is "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?"

In the given ontology, we have information about when each person joined the band (using `:hasTime`), but we do not have explicit end dates or durations for their memberships. Without end dates, we cannot determine if a person was still a member at a specific point in time. Under the closed world assumption, we cannot infer that a person remained a member indefinitely after their start date.

Therefore, while we can retrieve the start dates of band members, we cannot conclusively answer whether they were members at any arbitrary point in time.

Here is a SPARQL query that extracts available information about band members and their start dates:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?role ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_PersonRoleBandTime ;
              :hasPerson ?person ;
              :hasBand :RedHotChiliPeppers ;
              :hasTime ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :hasRole ?role . }
}
ORDER BY ?startDate
```

This query will list the members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers along with their roles and start dates, but it cannot determine membership at a specific point in time due to missing end date information.
