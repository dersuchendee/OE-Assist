SELECT DISTINCT ?actor ?competency
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :actorHasCompetency ?ac .
  ?ac :competencyOfActor ?competency .
}
```

The competency question "What actors hold this competency?" is answerable using the given ontology. The SPARQL query traverses from the `Cl_Actor` class through the `actorHasCompetency` property to the `Cl_ActorCompetency` class, and then to the `Cl_Competency` class via the `competencyOfActor` property. This effectively retrieves all actors and their associated competencies as defined in the ontology.
