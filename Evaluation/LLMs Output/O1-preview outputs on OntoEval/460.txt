Answer: **Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology because it includes the class `Cl_Membership`, which reifies the membership relationship between a person and a band with associated start and end dates. This allows us to query for members of a band at a specific point in time.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the members of a certain band at a certain point in time:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?member ?memberName ?roleName
WHERE {
  ?band a :Cl_Band ;
        rdfs:label ?bandName .
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership ;
              :membershipBand ?band ;
              :membershipPerson ?member ;
              :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :hasRole ?role . ?role :roleName ?roleName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberName . }

  FILTER (
    ?startDate <= ?date &&
    ( !bound(?endDate) || ?endDate >= ?date )
  )
}
```

**Parameters to provide:**
- `?bandName` — The name of the band (e.g., `"Red Hot Chili Peppers"`).
- `?date` — The date of interest in `xsd:date` format (e.g., `"2006-08-11"^^xsd:date`).

This query selects all members (`?member`) of the specified band at the given date, along with their names (`?memberName`) and roles (`?roleName`), ensuring that the date falls within their membership period.
