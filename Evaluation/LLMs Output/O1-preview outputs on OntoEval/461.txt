Replace `:GivenBand` with the specific band URI (e.g., `:RedHotChiliPeppers`), and `"GivenDate"` with the specific date (e.g., `"2006-08-11"`). This query retrieves all persons who were members of the given band at the specified point in time based on the membership information provided in the ontology.
