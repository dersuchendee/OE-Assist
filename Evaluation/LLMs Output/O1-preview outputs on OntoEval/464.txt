**Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the ontology by querying for band memberships that are active at a specific point in time. Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the members of a certain band at a given date:

```sparql
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?member
WHERE {
  ?member :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipInBand ?band .
  ?membership :membershipStart ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?endDate . }

  FILTER (
    ?startDate <= ?targetDate^^xsd:date &&
    ( !bound(?endDate) || ?targetDate^^xsd:date <= ?endDate )
  )
}
```

To use this query:
- Replace `?band` with the URI of the band you're interested in (e.g., `:RedHotChiliPeppers`).
- Bind `?targetDate` to the date you want to check membership for (e.g., `"2006-08-11"`).

If you have labels or names associated with persons, you can modify the query to include member names:

```sparql
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?member ?memberName
WHERE {
  ?member :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipInBand ?band .
  ?membership :membershipStart ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?endDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberName . }

  FILTER (
    ?startDate <= ?targetDate^^xsd:date &&
    ( !bound(?endDate) || ?targetDate^^xsd:date <= ?endDate )
  )
}
```

This query will return the members along with their names who were part of the specified band at the given date. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties (`:Cl_Membership`, `:membershipStart`, `:membershipEnd`, `:hasMembership`, and `:membershipInBand`) to model memberships over time, enabling the competency question to be answered.
