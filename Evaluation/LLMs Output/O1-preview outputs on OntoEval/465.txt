Answer: **No**

The given ontology does not provide sufficient information to answer the competency question fully because it lacks properties to represent specific time points or periods for `:Cl_TimePeriod`. Without start and end dates or timestamps, we cannot determine band membership at a certain point in time.

However, we can retrieve the members of a certain band, disregarding the time aspect:

```sparql
SELECT ?person
WHERE {
  ?band :hasMember ?bandMembership .
  ?person :isMemberOfBand ?bandMembership .
  FILTER (?band = :GivenBand)
}
```

This query lists all members associated with `:GivenBand`, but it does not filter them based on time since that information is not available in the ontology.
