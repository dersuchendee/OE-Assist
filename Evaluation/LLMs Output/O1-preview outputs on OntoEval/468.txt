This SPARQL query retrieves the role (`?Role`) that a person (`?PersonName`) has in a band (`?BandName`) at a specific point in time (`?Date`). It uses the `:Cl_BandMembership` class to link the person, band, role, and membership dates, allowing us to check whether the person was a member of the band during the given date. The ontology provides sufficient classes and properties to model this competency question.
