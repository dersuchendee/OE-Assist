**Explanation:**

The competency question asks: *What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?*

In the given ontology, we can determine:
- The **person** and their overall **role** (`ns1:hasRole` connects `ns1:Person` to `ns1:Role`).
- The **band** they are a member of, and the **time interval** during which they were members, through the `ns1:hasMembership` and `ns1:membershipInBand` properties and the `ns1:BandMembership` class.
- However, there is **no direct connection** between the **role** and the **band membership** or the **time interval**. The ontology does not specify the role a person had **in a specific band** at a specific time.

Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question with the given ontology, as it lacks the necessary linkage between a person's role and their band membership over time.

The provided SPARQL query extracts partial information:
- It retrieves the person, their role, the band they were members of, and the time interval of their membership.
- It does **not** link the role to the specific band membership or time interval, due to the missing ontology connections.
