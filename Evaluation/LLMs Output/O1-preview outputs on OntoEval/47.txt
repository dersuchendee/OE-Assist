**Yes**

The competency question "What actors hold this competency?" is answerable using the given ontology because it defines the necessary classes and properties to model this question. The ontology includes:

- The class **`:Actor`**, representing individuals or organizations that perform work.
- The class **`:Competency`**, representing skills or abilities.
- The object property **`:hasCompetency`**, which relates actors to the competencies they hold.

Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve actors who hold a specific competency.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/circular_value_network#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Actor .
  ?actor :hasCompetency :SpecificCompetency .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}
```

In this query, replace `:SpecificCompetency` with the URI of the specific competency you're interested in. This query will return all actors who hold that competency, along with their labels if available.
