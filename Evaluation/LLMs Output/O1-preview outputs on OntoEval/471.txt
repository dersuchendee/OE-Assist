```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role
WHERE {
    ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership .
    ?membership :hasPerson ?person .
    ?membership :hasBand ?band .
    ?membership :hasRole ?role .
    ?membership :hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
    ?timePeriod :startDate ?startDate .
    ?timePeriod :endDate ?endDate .
    # Assuming ?inputDate is bound to the point in time we're interested in
    FILTER (?inputDate >= ?startDate && ?inputDate <= ?endDate)
}
```

This query retrieves the role that a certain person has in a certain band at a certain point in time by leveraging the `:Cl_BandMembership` class, which connects persons, bands, roles, and time periods within the ontology. The `FILTER` condition ensures that only memberships active at the specified `?inputDate` are returned.
