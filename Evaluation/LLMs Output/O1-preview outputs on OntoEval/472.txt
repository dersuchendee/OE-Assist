Answer: **Yes**

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve the role(s) that a certain person has in a certain band at a certain point in time:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?roleName
WHERE {
  # Replace with the specific person, band, and date
  BIND (<http://example.org/music#JohnFrusciante> AS ?person)
  BIND (<http://example.org/music#RedHotChiliPeppers> AS ?band)
  BIND ("2000-01-01"^^xsd:date AS ?givenDate)
  
  ?bandMembership a :BandMembership ;
                  :involvesMember ?person ;
                  :hasBand ?band ;
                  :hasRole ?role ;
                  :hasTimeInterval ?ti .
                  
  ?ti :startDate ?startDate .
  ?ti :endDate ?endDate .
  
  FILTER (?givenDate >= ?startDate && ?givenDate <= ?endDate)
  
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
}
```

This query retrieves the role(s) that `?person` has in `?band` during the time interval that includes `?givenDate`. Make sure to replace `<http://example.org/music#JohnFrusciante>`, `<http://example.org/music#RedHotChiliPeppers>`, and `"2000-01-01"` with the specific person, band, and date you're interested in.
