Answer: **No**

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?roleName
WHERE {
  ?person rdf:type :Cl_Person .
  ?person :name ?personName .
  
  ?person :hasRole ?memberRole .
  ?memberRole :roleName ?roleName .
  
  OPTIONAL {
    ?memberRole :atTime ?timePeriod .
    ?timePeriod :startDate ?startDate .
    ?timePeriod :endDate ?endDate .
  }
}
```

This query extracts the roles associated with each person and any time periods if available. However, since the ontology does not link the `Cl_MemberRole` class to the `Cl_Band` class, we cannot determine the role a person has in a specific band at a certain point in time.
