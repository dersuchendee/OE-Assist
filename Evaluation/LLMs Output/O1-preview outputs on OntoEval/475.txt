**No**

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?time
WHERE {
  ?person :hasRole ?bandRole .
  ?band :roleOf ?bandRole .
  ?bandRole :rolePeriod ?time .
}
```

Unfortunately, the given ontology does not provide a way to retrieve the specific role (e.g., 'vocalist', 'guitarist') that a person has in a band at a certain point in time. While it models the relationships between a person, a band, and a time period through the `:Cl_BandRole` class and associated properties (`:hasRole`, `:roleOf`, `:rolePeriod`), there is no property or class in the ontology that captures the specific role name or type. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question with the given ontology under the closed world assumption.
