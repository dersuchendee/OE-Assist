The ontology supports the competency question because it models the relationships between a person, their role, the band, and the time through the `:Cl_PersonRoleBandTime` class and associated properties `:hasPerson`, `:hasRole`, `:hasBand`, and `:hasTime`.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the role a certain person has in a certain band at a certain point in time:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?Person ?PersonName ?Role ?RoleName ?Band ?BandName ?Time
WHERE {
    ?PersonRoleBandTime a :Cl_PersonRoleBandTime ;
        :hasPerson ?Person ;
        :hasRole ?Role ;
        :hasBand ?Band ;
        :hasTime ?Time .
    OPTIONAL { ?Person rdfs:label ?PersonName . }
    OPTIONAL { ?Role rdfs:label ?RoleName . }
    OPTIONAL { ?Band rdfs:label ?BandName . }
}
```

This query retrieves all instances where a person has a role in a band at a specific time, effectively answering the competency question.
