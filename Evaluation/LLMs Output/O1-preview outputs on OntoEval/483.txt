**Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the given ontology. Here's the SPARQL query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?roleName
WHERE {
  ?person :membership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipBand ?band .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate . }
  ?membership :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
  
  FILTER ( ?startDate <= ?time && ( !bound(?endDate) || ?time <= ?endDate ) )
}
```

In this query:
- `?person` is the individual of interest.
- `?band` is the band of interest.
- `?time` is the specific point in time (xsd:date).
- The query finds the role (`?roleName`) that the person has in the band at the given time by checking the membership start and end dates.
