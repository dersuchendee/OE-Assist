The competency question can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `Cl_Membership` class which models a person's membership in a band over time with a role. This allows us to query for the role a person has in a band at a specific point in time.

Here's the SPARQL query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?role
WHERE {
  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipIn ?band .
  ?membership :hasRole ?role .
  ?membership :membershipStart ?startDate .
  ?membership :membershipEnd ?endDate .
  FILTER (
    ?person = :SpecificPerson &&
    ?band = :SpecificBand &&
    xsd:date(:specificDate) >= ?startDate &&
    xsd:date(:specificDate) <= ?endDate
  )
}
```

In this query:

- Replace `:SpecificPerson` with the URI of the person you're interested in.
- Replace `:SpecificBand` with the URI of the band.
- Replace `:specificDate` with the date you're querying for (in `YYYY-MM-DD` format).

This query finds the role(s) that a given person had in a given band at a specific point in time by checking if the date falls within the membership start and end dates.
