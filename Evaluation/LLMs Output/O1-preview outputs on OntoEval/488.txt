Answer: **Yes**.

Here the CQ is answerable since the competency question is a Reification CQâ€”meaning all classes and datatypes in the CQ are connected via a reified class in the ontology (`:Cl_BandRole`). This allows us to formulate a SPARQL query to extract the desired information.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :hasRoleInBand ?bandRole .

  ?bandRole a :Cl_BandRole ;
            :playsRole ?role ;
            :roleDuring ?timePeriod .

  ?bandRole rdfs:subClassOf :Cl_Band .
  ?band a :Cl_Band .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, the band they have a role in, the specific role, and the time period during which they held that role. It leverages the reification class `:Cl_BandRole`, which connects `:Cl_Person`, `:Cl_Band`, `:Cl_Role`, and `:Cl_TimePeriod`.
