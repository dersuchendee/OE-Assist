Answer: **No**

The given ontology does not provide a direct connection between an album and its recording time period. Specifically, there is no property that links an instance of `:Cl_AlbumRecording` (which has the recording start and end dates) to its corresponding `:Cl_Album`. Without a property to associate an album recording with the album, we cannot fully answer the competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" using the ontology.

However, we can extract the recording time periods of album recordings in the ontology without associating them with specific albums. Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve the recording start and end dates of album recordings:

```sparql
SELECT ?albumRecording ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?albumRecording rdf:type :Cl_AlbumRecording .
  OPTIONAL { ?albumRecording :dp_recordingStartDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?albumRecording :dp_recordingEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of `:Cl_AlbumRecording` along with their recording start and end dates, if available. However, since we cannot link these recordings to specific albums, the query provides only a partial answer to the competency question.
