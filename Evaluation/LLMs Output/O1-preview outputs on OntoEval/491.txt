```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?album :dp_recordStartDate ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?album :dp_recordingEndDate ?endDate . }
}
```

**Explanation:**

The competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" cannot be fully answered by the given ontology because there is no direct connection between the album and the recording end date. While the ontology provides the `:dp_recordStartDate` property associated with `:Cl_Album`, it lacks a corresponding `:dp_recordEndDate` (or `:dp_recordingEndDate`) property connected to the album. The `:dp_releaseDate` might not accurately represent the recording end date. Therefore, we can only partially answer the question by retrieving the recording start dates of albums.

The provided SPARQL query extracts albums along with their labels, recording start dates, and (if available) recording end dates. This offers a partial answer based on the available data in the ontology.
