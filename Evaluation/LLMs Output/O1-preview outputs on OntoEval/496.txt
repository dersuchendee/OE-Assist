Answer: **No**

Under the closed world assumption, the ontology does not provide a way to identify a specific album (e.g., by name or identifier) because there is no data property for the album's name or a unique identifier. Therefore, we cannot retrieve the recording period for a certain album as requested by the competency question.

However, we can extract a partial answer by retrieving the recording periods for all albums present in the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?recordingPeriod
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasRecording ?recording .
  ?recording :recordingPeriod ?recordingPeriod .
}
```
