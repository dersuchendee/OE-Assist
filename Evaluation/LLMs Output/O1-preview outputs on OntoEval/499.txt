**No**

The ontology lacks properties that associate `Cl_TimePeriod` with specific dates or durations. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" because we cannot retrieve the actual time periods or dates associated with album recordings.

However, we can extract partial information about which albums were recorded and their associated time periods (without specific dates):

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumRecording ?timePeriod
WHERE {
    ?album a :Cl_Album .
    ?album :recordedDuring ?albumRecording .
    ?albumRecording a :Cl_AlbumRecording .
    ?albumRecording :hasRecording ?timePeriod .
    ?timePeriod a :Cl_TimePeriod .
}
```

This query retrieves albums and their related time periods but does not provide specific start or end dates for when the albums were recorded.
