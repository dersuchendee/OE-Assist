SELECT ?source ?type
WHERE {
  ?source a :Source .
  ?source :hasType ?type .
}
```

The competency question "Which is the type of a source?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology defines a property `:hasType` that connects a `:Source` to its `:Type`. The SPARQL query above selects all sources and their associated types by querying instances of `:Source` and retrieving their `:hasType` values.
