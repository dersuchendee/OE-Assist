Answer: **Yes**.

The ontology supports the competency question as it models the actors involved in a circular value network through the `:hasActor` property connecting `:ValueNetwork` to `:Actor`.

```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel
WHERE {
  ?valueNetwork a :ValueNetwork .
  ?valueNetwork :hasActor ?actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}
```
