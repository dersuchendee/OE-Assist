**Answer: Yes**

The competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to retrieve the recording period of an album. Specifically, it models albums (`:Cl_Album`), recording sessions (`:Cl_RecordingSession`), and the relationship between them via the `:recordedDuring` property. Each recording session has start and end dates specified by the `:recordingStartDate` and `:recordingEndDate` data properties.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the recording start and end dates for each album:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :recordedDuring ?recordingSession .
  ?recordingSession :recordingStartDate ?startDate .
  ?recordingSession :recordingEndDate ?endDate .
}
```

If you want to retrieve the recording period for a specific album, such as "Stadium Arcadium," you can use the following query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  :StadiumArcadium :recordedDuring ?recordingSession .
  ?recordingSession :recordingStartDate ?startDate .
  ?recordingSession :recordingEndDate ?endDate .
}
```

This query directly accesses the `:StadiumArcadium` individual of class `:Cl_Album` and retrieves its associated recording session's start and end dates.
