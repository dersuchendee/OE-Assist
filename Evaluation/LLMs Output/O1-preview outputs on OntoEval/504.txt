**Answer: Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology includes information about albums and their recording periods through the class `:Cl_RecordingPeriod`. Each recording period is linked to an album via the `:recordedAlbum` property and has data properties `:recordingStart` and `:recordingEnd`, which provide the time period during which the album was recorded.
