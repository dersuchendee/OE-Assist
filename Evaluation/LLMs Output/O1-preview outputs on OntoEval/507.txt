The competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that model albums, recording sessions, and the time periods associated with those sessions.

In the ontology:
- `:Cl_Album` represents albums.
- `:Cl_RecordingSession` represents recording sessions.
- Each `:Cl_RecordingSession` is linked to an album via the `:recordedDuring` property.
- The start and end dates of a recording session are given by the `:membershipStart` and `:membershipEnd` properties (though these property names might be better suited as `:sessionStart` and `:sessionEnd` for clarity).

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the recording time period for each album:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumName ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumName . }

  ?recordingSession a :Cl_RecordingSession .
  ?recordingSession :recordedDuring ?album .
  ?recordingSession :membershipStart ?startDate .
  ?recordingSession :membershipEnd ?endDate .
}
```

This query selects albums and their associated recording start and end dates by traversing the relationships defined in the ontology.
