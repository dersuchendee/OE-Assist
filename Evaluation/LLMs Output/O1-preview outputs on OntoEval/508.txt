Answer: **Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology includes the class `:Cl_Album` with data properties `:recordingStart` and `:recordingEnd`, which represent the start and end dates of an album's recording period. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the recording time period of each album.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album :recordingStart ?recordingStart . }
  OPTIONAL { ?album :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd . }
}
```
