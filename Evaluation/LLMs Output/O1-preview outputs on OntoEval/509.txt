**Answer**: **Yes**

The competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_Album` and the related class `:Cl_RecordingSession`, connected via the property `:hasRecordingSession`. The recording session has properties `:recordingStartDate` and `:recordingEndDate` which indicate the time period of the recording.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the recording start and end dates for each album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?startDate ?endDate WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasRecordingSession ?session .
  ?session :recordingStartDate ?startDate .
  ?session :recordingEndDate ?endDate .
}
```

If you are interested in a specific album, for example `:StadiumArcadium`, you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?startDate ?endDate WHERE {
  :StadiumArcadium a :Cl_Album .
  :StadiumArcadium :hasRecordingSession ?session .
  ?session :recordingStartDate ?startDate .
  ?session :recordingEndDate ?endDate .
}
```

This query will return the recording start and end dates for the specified album.
