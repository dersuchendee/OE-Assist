**No**

The ontology lacks a property to identify a specific album (such as an album name or label), so we cannot answer the CQ fully. However, we can provide a partial answer by retrieving the recording start and end dates for all albums.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album :recordingStart ?recordingStart . }
  OPTIONAL { ?album :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd . }
}
```
