**No**

The ontology does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" Under the closed world assumption, the ontology only specifies one track (`Hump de Bump`) for the album `Stadium Arcadium`, and it does not specify that the album contains 28 tracks as mentioned in the story.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer based on the available data:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel (COUNT(DISTINCT ?track) AS ?numberOfTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  OPTIONAL {
    { ?album :containsTrack ?track . }
    UNION
    { ?album :hasMusicTrack ?track . }
  }
}
GROUP BY ?album ?albumLabel
```

This query attempts to count the number of tracks associated with each album using the `:containsTrack` and `:hasMusicTrack` properties. Given the ontology, it will return the album `Stadium Arcadium` with one track (`Hump de Bump`), which is a partial answer to the competency question.
