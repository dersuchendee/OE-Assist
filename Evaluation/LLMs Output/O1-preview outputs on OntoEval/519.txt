Answer: **Yes**

Since the ontology includes classes `:Cl_Album` and `:Cl_Track` and defines the object property `:hasTrack` from albums to tracks, we can determine how many tracks a particular album contains by counting the number of `:hasTrack` relations for each album. Additionally, the ontology defines a data property `:trackCount` which, if populated, directly provides the number of tracks for an album.

Here is a SPARQL query to count the number of tracks for each album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numberOfTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album
```

Alternatively, if the `:trackCount` data property is used and populated in the ontology, we can retrieve the track count directly:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?trackCount
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :trackCount ?trackCount .
}
```
