**Yes**

Here is the SPARQL query that answers the competency question:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/cvn_ontology#>

SELECT ?cvn ?cvnLabel
WHERE {
  # Replace :ProcessA with the process of interest
  :ProcessA :isProcessOf ?cvn .
  OPTIONAL { ?cvn rdfs:label ?cvnLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves the CVNs in which a specific process (e.g., `:ProcessA`) is used. It leverages the `:isProcessOf` property, which connects a `:Process` to the `:CVN` it is part of, as defined in the ontology. The `rdfs:label` is optionally retrieved for better readability of the results.
