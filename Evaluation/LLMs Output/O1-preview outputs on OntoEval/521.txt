SELECT ?album (COUNT(?albumTrack) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?albumTrack .
  ?albumTrack a :Cl_AlbumTrack .
}
GROUP BY ?album
```

This query retrieves each album in the ontology and counts the number of associated tracks through the `:containsTrack` property. The `COUNT` function aggregates the number of `:Cl_AlbumTrack` instances for each album, effectively answering the competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?"
