**No**

The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" cannot be fully answered by the given ontology because the relationship between albums and tracks and the `:numberOfTracks` property are not modeled correctly to provide the exact count of tracks for an album.

However, we can extract partial information about which tracks are contained in an album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumTrack
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTracks ?albumTrack .
}
```

This query retrieves albums and their associated tracks but does not provide the count of tracks per album since the `:numberOfTracks` property is not properly connected to the album instances in a way that allows counting the tracks for a particular album.
