Answer: **Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the ontology because the ontology includes the `:numberOfTracks` data property for instances of `:Cl_Album`. Specifically, the album `:Stadium_Arcadium` has the `:numberOfTracks` property with the value 28.

Here is a SPARQL query to find out how many tracks a particular album contains (e.g., `:Stadium_Arcadium`):

```sparql
SELECT ?numTracks
WHERE {
  :Stadium_Arcadium a :Cl_Album .
  :Stadium_Arcadium :numberOfTracks ?numTracks .
}
```

If you want to parameterize the query for any album, you can use:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?numTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :numberOfTracks ?numTracks .
}
```

This query will return the number of tracks for all albums in the ontology.
