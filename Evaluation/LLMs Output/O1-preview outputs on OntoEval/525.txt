Answer: **Yes**

The competency question asks: *"How many tracks does a particular album contain?"*

In the given ontology, the class `:Cl_Album` has a data property `:numberOfTracks` that directly provides the number of tracks an album contains. Therefore, the CQ can be answered using this ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the number of tracks for each album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?numberOfTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :numberOfTracks ?numberOfTracks .
}
```

If you want to find out the number of tracks for a specific album, such as "Stadium Arcadium", you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?numberOfTracks
WHERE {
  :StadiumArcadium a :Cl_Album .
  :StadiumArcadium :numberOfTracks ?numberOfTracks .
}
```

This query will return the number of tracks contained in the specified album.
