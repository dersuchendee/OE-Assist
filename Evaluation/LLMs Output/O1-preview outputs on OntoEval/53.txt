# Since there are no individuals defined in the ontology, we cannot retrieve the actors involved in any value network.
# However, if instances were present, we could use the following query to obtain the actors involved in this value network.

SELECT ?actor ?valueNetwork
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :op_involvedIn ?valueNetwork .
