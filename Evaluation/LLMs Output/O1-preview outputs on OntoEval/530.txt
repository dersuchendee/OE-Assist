Answer: **Yes**.

You can retrieve the number of tracks that a particular album contains using the `:numberOfTracks` data property associated with the `:Cl_Album` class.

Here's a SPARQL query that answers the competency question:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?numberOfTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :numberOfTracks ?numberOfTracks .
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Cl_Album` and retrieves the value of their `:numberOfTracks` property, effectively providing the number of tracks for each album.

Alternatively, if you want to count the number of `:containsTrack` relationships for each album (in case the `:numberOfTracks` property is not available), you can use the following query:

```sparql
SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numberOfTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album
```

This query counts the number of tracks associated with each album through the `:containsTrack` object property, giving you the number of tracks that each album contains.
