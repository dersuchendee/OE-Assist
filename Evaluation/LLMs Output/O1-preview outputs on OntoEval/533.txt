The competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_Album`, the datatype property `:numberOfTracks`, and associates this property with `:Cl_Album`. Therefore, we can construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the number of tracks for a particular album.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the number of tracks for all albums:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumName ?numberOfTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumName . }
  ?album :numberOfTracks ?numberOfTracks .
}
```

If we want to retrieve the number of tracks for a specific album, for example, "Stadium Arcadium", we can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?numberOfTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         rdfs:label "Stadium Arcadium" ;
         :numberOfTracks ?numberOfTracks .
}
```

This query selects the `numberOfTracks` property for the album labeled "Stadium Arcadium".
