Answer: **Yes**

We can answer this competency question using the given ontology, as it includes classes and properties that represent albums and the number of tracks they contain.

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve how many tracks each album contains:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?trackCount
WHERE {
  ?album rdf:type :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTracks ?albumTrackCount .
  ?albumTrackCount :trackCount ?trackCount .
}
```
