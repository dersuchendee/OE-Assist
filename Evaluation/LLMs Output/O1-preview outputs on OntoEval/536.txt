Answer: **Yes**

The competency question can be answered because the ontology includes information about music albums and their release dates through the `:releaseDate` property associated with instances of `:MusicAlbum`.

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve the release date of each album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :MusicAlbum .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

This query selects all albums in the ontology, along with their labels (if available), and their release dates.
