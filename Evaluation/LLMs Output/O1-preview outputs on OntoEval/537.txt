**Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?albumName ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
  ?album :hasReleaseDate ?releaseDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?album :hasName ?albumName . }
}
```

**Explanation:**

The competency question asks: "**When was a certain album released?**"

From the provided ontology, we have the class `:Cl_MusicAlbum` representing music albums. Albums have the data property `:hasReleaseDate`, which provides the release date of the album. Additionally, albums may have a `:hasName` property that gives the album's name.

Here's how the ontology supports the CQ:

- **Classes and Properties:**
  - `:Cl_MusicAlbum`: Represents albums.
  - `:hasReleaseDate`: A datatype property linking an album to its release date (`xsd:date`).
  - `:hasName`: An optional property giving the name of the album.

- **Individuals (Example):**
  ```turtle
  :StadiumArcadium rdf:type :Cl_MusicAlbum ;
                   :hasName "Stadium Arcadium" ;
                   :hasReleaseDate "2006-05-05"^^xsd:date .
  ```

The SPARQL query retrieves all albums along with their names and release dates. If you have a specific album in mind, you can modify the query to filter by the album's name:

```sparql
SELECT ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
  ?album :hasReleaseDate ?releaseDate .
  ?album :hasName "Stadium Arcadium" .
}
```

This provides the release date for "Stadium Arcadium".
