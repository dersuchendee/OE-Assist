**No**

Under the closed world assumption, the ontology does not contain any instances of `:Cl_Album` or any data about release dates. Therefore, we cannot answer the competency question "When was a certain album released?" because there's no way to identify a specific album or retrieve its release date.

However, we can write a SPARQL query that would retrieve the release dates of albums if such data were present:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :release_date ?releaseDate .
}
```
