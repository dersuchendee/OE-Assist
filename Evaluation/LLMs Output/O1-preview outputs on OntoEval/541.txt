Answer: **Yes**

You can retrieve the release date of a specific album using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>

SELECT ?albumTitle ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album ;
         :albumTitle ?albumTitle ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

If you want to find the release date of a particular album (e.g., "Stadium Arcadium"), you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>

SELECT ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album ;
         :albumTitle "Stadium Arcadium" ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

This query will return the release date of the album "Stadium Arcadium" as stored in the ontology.
