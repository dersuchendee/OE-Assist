Answer: **No**

The ontology lacks a property to uniquely identify a specific album (e.g., by name or identifier). Therefore, we cannot specify a certain album in the query. The following SPARQL query retrieves the release dates of all albums in the ontology:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releasedAlbum ?release .
  ?release :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

In this query, `?album` represents each album in the ontology, and `?releaseDate` is its corresponding release date.
