The competency question "When was a certain album released?" can be answered by the ontology because it includes the necessary classes and properties to represent albums and their release dates. Specifically, the ontology defines:

- Class `:Cl_Album`
- Class `:Cl_AlbumRelease` which is associated with `:Cl_Album` via the property `:releasedOn`
- Property `:releaseDate` that associates an `:Cl_AlbumRelease` with an `xsd:date`

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve the release date of each album:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?releaseDate WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releasedOn ?albumRelease .
  ?albumRelease a :Cl_AlbumRelease .
  ?albumRelease :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

If you want to find the release date of a specific album (e.g., `:Stadium_Arcadium`), you can use the following query:

```sparql
SELECT ?releaseDate WHERE {
  :Stadium_Arcadium a :Cl_Album .
  :Stadium_Arcadium :releasedOn ?albumRelease .
  ?albumRelease a :Cl_AlbumRelease .
  ?albumRelease :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

These queries navigate from the album to its release event and extract the associated release date, thus answering the competency question using the provided ontology.
