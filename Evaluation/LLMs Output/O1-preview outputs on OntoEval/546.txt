The competency question "When was a certain album released?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes albums with their release dates through the `:releaseDate` datatype property associated with instances of `:Cl_Album`.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the release dates of albums:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
    ?album a :Cl_Album .
    ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

This query selects all albums and their corresponding release dates from the ontology.
