Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "When was a certain album released?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology contains instances of `:Cl_Album` with associated release dates through the `:releaseDate` data property. Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves albums and their release dates:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album rdf:type :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

If you want to find the release date of a specific album, such as "Stadium Arcadium," you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  :Stadium_Arcadium rdf:type :Cl_Album .
  :Stadium_Arcadium :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

This query will retrieve the release date of the album `:Stadium_Arcadium`, which is specified in the ontology as:

```turtle
:Stadium_Arcadium :releaseDate "2006-05-05"^^xsd:date .
```

Thus, the ontology supports the competency question, and the release date can be extracted using the provided SPARQL query.
