Answer: **Yes**

Because the ontology includes the `:releaseDate` data property for albums (`:Cl_Album`), and there are instances of albums associated with their release dates. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the release date of any album.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
          :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

This query retrieves all albums and their corresponding release dates from the ontology.
