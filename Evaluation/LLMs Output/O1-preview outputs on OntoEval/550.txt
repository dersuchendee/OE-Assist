**No**

The ontology lacks a way to identify a specific album by name because there is no property like `:albumTitle`. Without this, we cannot fully answer the competency question "When was a certain album released?" since we cannot specify which album we're querying about.

However, we can retrieve the release dates for all albums in the ontology:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album rdf:type :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

This query will return all albums along with their release dates, but it does not allow us to select a specific album by name.
