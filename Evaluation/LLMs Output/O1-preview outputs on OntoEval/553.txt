Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "When was a certain album released?" is answerable because the ontology includes the class `:Cl_Album` and the data property `:releaseDate` linking albums to their release dates.

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

This query retrieves all albums and their corresponding release dates from the ontology.
