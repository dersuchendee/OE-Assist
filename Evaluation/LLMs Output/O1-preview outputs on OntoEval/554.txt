**Yes**

The competency question "When was a certain album released?" is supported by the ontology since it includes the necessary classes and properties to answer it. The ontology has the class `:Cl_Album` and a data property `:releaseDate` that relates an album to its release date.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the release date of a specific album. You can replace `"Album Name"` with the name of the album you're interested in.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  FILTER (str(?albumLabel) = "Album Name")
}
```

If you want to retrieve the release dates of all albums, you can omit the FILTER clause:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Cl_Album` and retrieves their `:releaseDate`. The presence of the `:releaseDate` property in the ontology allows us to answer the competency question, confirming that the ontology supports it.
