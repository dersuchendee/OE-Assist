```sparql
SELECT ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album rdfs:label "Album Name" .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the release date of a specific album by filtering on the album's name using `rdfs:label`. Replace `"Album Name"` with the actual name of the album you're interested in (e.g., `"Stadium Arcadium"`). The ontology supports this query because it includes the `:releaseDate` data property connected to `:Cl_Album`, and we can use `rdfs:label` to identify the specific album.
