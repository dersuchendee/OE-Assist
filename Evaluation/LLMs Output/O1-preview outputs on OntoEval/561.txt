The competency question cannot be fully answered because the ontology does not explicitly link tracks to the songs they are recordings of. In the ontology, `ns1:Track` and `ns1:Song` are separate classes, but instances like `ns1:HumpDeBump` are modeled as both a `ns1:Track` and a `ns1:Song`. There is no property that connects a `ns1:Track` to a `ns1:Song` to indicate that the track is a recording of the song. The provided SPARQL query retrieves all tracks and their labels, which is a partial answer.
