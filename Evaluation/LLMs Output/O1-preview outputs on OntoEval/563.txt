Answer: **Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology includes the class `:Cl_Track` and the object property `:isRecordingOf` that links a track to the song it is a recording of. This allows us to retrieve the song associated with a specific track.

Here's a SPARQL query to find out what song a specific track is a recording of:

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  :SpecificTrack :isRecordingOf ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
```

Replace `:SpecificTrack` with the specific track you're interested in. If you want to retrieve this information for all tracks, you can use the following query:

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?trackLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?track rdfs:label ?trackLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
```
