**Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?songTitle
WHERE {
  # Specify the specific track you're interested in
  :SpecificTrack a :Track ;
                 :isRecordingOf ?song .
                 
  ?song :songTitle ?songTitle .
}
```

**Explanation:**

The competency question is: *"What song is a specific track a recording of?"*

In the provided ontology, we have:

- **Classes:**
  - `:Track`: Represents a recorded instance of a song.
  - `:Song`: Represents an abstract musical composition.

- **Object Properties:**
  - `:isRecordingOf`: Relates a `:Track` to the `:Song` it is a recording of (with `rdfs:domain :Track` and `rdfs:range :Song`).

- **Individuals:**
  - For example, `:HumpDeBump_Track` is an instance of `:Track`, and it `:isRecordingOf` `:HumpDeBump_Song`.

Given this structure, the ontology supports answering the competency question. The SPARQL query retrieves the song associated with a specific track using the `:isRecordingOf` property.

**To query a specific track by name:**

If you want to specify the track by its title, you can modify the query:

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?songTitle
WHERE {
  ?track a :Track ;
         :trackTitle "Track Name" ;
         :isRecordingOf ?song .
  ?song :songTitle ?songTitle .
}
```

Replace `"Track Name"` with the title of the track you're interested in (e.g., `"Hump de Bump"`).
