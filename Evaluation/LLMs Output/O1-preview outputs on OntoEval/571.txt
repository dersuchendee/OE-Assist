**Yes**

The competency question "What song is a specific track a recording of?" can be answered using the ontology because it includes the `:isRecordingOf` property that connects instances of `:Cl_Track` to instances of `:Cl_Song`.

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track rdf:type :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?song .
}
```
