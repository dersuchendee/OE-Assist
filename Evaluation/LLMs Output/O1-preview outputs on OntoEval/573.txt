Answer: **Yes**.

We can answer the competency question because the ontology includes the property `:recordingOf` linking tracks (`:Cl_Track`) to songs (`:Cl_Song`), and instances of tracks are related to songs via this property.

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track rdf:type :Cl_Track .
  ?track :recordingOf ?song .
}
```
