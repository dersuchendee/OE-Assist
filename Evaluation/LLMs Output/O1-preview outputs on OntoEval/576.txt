The ontology supports the competency question because it includes the class `:Cl_Track` for tracks and `:Cl_Song` for songs, connected by the object property `:trackOf`. This property allows us to find out which song a specific track is a recording of.

Here's the SPARQL query to retrieve the song that a specific track is a recording of:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?song
WHERE {
    :specifiedTrack :trackOf ?song .
}
```

Replace `:specifiedTrack` with the URI of the specific track you're interested in, such as `:Track_HumpDeBump`. For example:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?song
WHERE {
    :Track_HumpDeBump :trackOf ?song .
}
```

This query will return the song associated with the specified track.
