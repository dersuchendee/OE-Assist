**Yes**

The competency question "What song is a specific track a recording of?" is answerable using the ontology because it includes the relevant classes and properties:

- Classes: `:Cl_Track` and `:Cl_Song`.
- Object Property: `:isRecordingOf` which connects a track to the song it is a recording of.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the song associated with each track:

```sparql
SELECT ?track ?trackLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  OPTIONAL { ?track rdfs:label ?trackLabel . }

  ?track :isRecordingOf ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
```

If you are interested in a specific track (e.g., `:HumpDeBumpTrack`), the query would be:

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  :HumpDeBumpTrack a :Cl_Track .
  :HumpDeBumpTrack :isRecordingOf ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
```

This query will provide the song that the specified track is a recording of, fulfilling the competency question using the ontology provided.
