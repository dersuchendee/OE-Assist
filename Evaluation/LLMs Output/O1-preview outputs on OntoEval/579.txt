Answer: **Yes**

The ontology supports the competency question "What song is a specific track a recording of?" because it includes the classes `:Cl_Track` and `:Cl_Song`, and the object property `:isRecordingOf` that links a track to the song it records.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the song recorded by each track:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?track ?trackName ?song ?songName
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  OPTIONAL { ?track rdfs:label ?trackName . }
  
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songName . }
}
ORDER BY ?trackName
```

This query selects all individuals of type `:Cl_Track`, optionally retrieves their labels, and finds the songs they are recordings of via the `:isRecordingOf` property. It also optionally retrieves the labels of the songs.

If you are interested in a specific track (e.g., with a known URI), you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?song ?songName
WHERE {
  :SpecificTrack a :Cl_Track .
  
  :SpecificTrack :isRecordingOf ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songName . }
}
```

Replace `:SpecificTrack` with the actual URI of the track you're interested in. This query will retrieve the song that the specific track is a recording of.
