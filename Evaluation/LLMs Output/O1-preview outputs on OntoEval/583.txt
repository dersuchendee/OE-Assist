**Yes**

The competency question "When was a certain song composed?" is answerable using the provided ontology. In the ontology, we have:

- **Class**: `:Cl_Song` representing songs.
- **Data Property**: `:hasCompositionDate` with domain `:Cl_Song` and range `xsd:date`, linking songs to their composition dates.

Therefore, we can retrieve the composition date of songs using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?songName ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :hasName ?songName .
  ?song :hasCompositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
```

This query selects all songs in the ontology along with their names and composition dates, effectively answering the competency question.
