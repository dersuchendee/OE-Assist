We can answer the competency question "When was a certain song composed?" using the provided ontology. The ontology includes information about songs (`ns1:Song`) and their composition dates through the `ns1:composedOn` property. Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the composition date of each song:

```sparql
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?songLabel ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a ns1:Song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  ?song ns1:composedOn ?compositionDate .
}
ORDER BY ?songLabel
```

This query selects all resources of type `ns1:Song`, retrieves their labels (if available), and their composition dates. It effectively answers the competency question by providing the composition dates of songs present in the ontology.
