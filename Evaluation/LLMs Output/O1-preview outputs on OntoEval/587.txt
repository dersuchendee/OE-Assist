Answer: **Yes**

The Competency Question "When was a certain song composed?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Song` with a datatype property `:compositionDate`, which records the composition date of songs. 

Here is the SPARQL query to retrieve the composition date of a specific song:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?songTitle ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Song ;
        :songTitle ?songTitle ;
        :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
```

If you want to find the composition date of a specific song, such as "Hump de Bump", you can add a filter:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Song ;
        :songTitle "Hump de Bump" ;
        :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
```

This query will return the composition date of the song "Hump de Bump", which according to the ontology is "2004-01-26".
