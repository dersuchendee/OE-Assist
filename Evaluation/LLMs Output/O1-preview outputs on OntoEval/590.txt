```sparql
SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :composedOn ?composition .
  ?composition a :Cl_SongComposition .
  ?composition :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
```

This query retrieves songs and their composition dates by traversing the relationships defined in the ontology:

- `:Cl_Song` represents songs.
- `:composedOn` links a song to its composition event.
- `:Cl_SongComposition` represents the composition event.
- `:compositionDate` provides the date when the song was composed.

If you are interested in a specific song, for example, "Hump de Bump", you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song ;
        rdfs:label "Hump de Bump" ;
        :composedOn ?composition .
  ?composition :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
```

This modified query filters the song by its label to find the composition date of "Hump de Bump".
