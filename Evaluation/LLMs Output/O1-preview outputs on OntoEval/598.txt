Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "When was a certain song composed?" is answerable using the ontology provided. The ontology defines a class `:Cl_Song` and a datatype property `:composedOn` that links a song to its composition date.

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?date
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :composedOn ?date .
}
```
