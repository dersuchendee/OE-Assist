Answer: **Yes**.

The competency question "Which is the context of production of a source?" is answerable using the given ontology. The ontology models sources (`:Cl_Source`) and their contexts (`:Cl_SourceContext`). Each source can have a context via the `:hasContext` property, and the context includes details such as who created it (`:createdBy`), where (`:hasCreationPlace`), when (`:hasCreationDate`), the goal (`:hasGoal`), and related events (`:relatesToEvent`). Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the context of production for each source.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?source ?sourceType ?context ?creator ?creationDate ?creationPlace ?goal ?relatedEvent
WHERE {
    ?source a :Cl_Source .
    OPTIONAL {
        ?source a ?sourceType .
        FILTER(?sourceType != :Cl_Source)
    }
    OPTIONAL {
        ?source :hasContext ?context .
        OPTIONAL { ?context :createdBy ?creator . }
        OPTIONAL { ?context :hasCreationDate ?creationDate . }
        OPTIONAL { ?context :hasCreationPlace ?creationPlace . }
        OPTIONAL { ?context :hasGoal ?goal . }
        OPTIONAL { ?context :relatesToEvent ?relatedEvent . }
    }
}
```

This query retrieves each source and its associated context of production, including who created it, when and where it was created, its goal, and any related events. The `OPTIONAL` clauses are used to include information when it's available, allowing for partial data without excluding sources that may lack some context details.
