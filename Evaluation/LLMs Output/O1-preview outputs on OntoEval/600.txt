**Yes**

The ontology includes the class `:Cl_Song` and the datatype property `:composedDate` with domain `:Cl_Song` and range `xsd:date`. This means we can query for songs and their composition dates.

Here's a SPARQL query to find out when a certain song was composed:

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?composedDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :composedDate ?composedDate .
}
```

If you want to find the composed date of a specific song (e.g., "Hump de Bump"), assuming that song instances have labels, you can use:

```sparql
SELECT ?composedDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :composedDate ?composedDate .
  ?song rdfs:label "Hump de Bump" .
}
```
