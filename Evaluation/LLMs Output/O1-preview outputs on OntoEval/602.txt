**No**

The ontology lacks a property to identify a specific song (e.g., by name or title). Without a way to specify "a certain song," we cannot fully answer the competency question. However, we can provide a partial answer by listing all songs with their composed dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?composedDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :composedDate ?composedDate .
}
```
