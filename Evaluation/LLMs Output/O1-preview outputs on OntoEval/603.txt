**Yes**

The competency question "When was a certain song composed?" is supported by the ontology, as it models songs, their compositions, and composition dates through the classes and properties `:Cl_Song`, `:Cl_SongComposition`, and `:compositionDate`.

```sparql
SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :composedOn ?composition .
  ?composition a :Cl_SongComposition .
  ?composition :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
```
