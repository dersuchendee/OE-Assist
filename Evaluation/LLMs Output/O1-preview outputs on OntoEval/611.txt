The competency question "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes classes such as `:Cl_Critic`, `:Cl_Record`, and `:Cl_Review`, and properties that connect them, specifically `:givenBy`, `:about`, and `:reviewText`. This allows us to retrieve the review text that a specific critic has provided about a specific record.

Here's the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?reviewText
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_Review .
  ?review :givenBy :CertainCritic .
  ?review :about :CertainRecord .
  ?review :reviewText ?reviewText .
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `?review a :Cl_Review .` selects all instances of the `:Cl_Review` class.
- `?review :givenBy :CertainCritic .` filters reviews given by the specific critic (`:CertainCritic`).
- `?review :about :CertainRecord .` filters reviews that are about the specific record (`:CertainRecord`).
- `?review :reviewText ?reviewText .` retrieves the text of the review.

Make sure to replace `:CertainCritic` and `:CertainRecord` with the actual URIs of the critic and record you are interested in.
