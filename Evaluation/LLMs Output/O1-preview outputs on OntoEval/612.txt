The Competency Question (CQ) "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes classes and properties that represent critics, albums, reviews, and the relationships between them. Specifically, we have:

- `:Cl_Critic` representing critics.
- `:Cl_Album` representing albums.
- `:Cl_CriticReview` representing the review instance relating a critic to an album.
- Properties such as `:reviewsAlbum`, `:reviewedAlbum`, and `:reviewText` that connect critics to reviews and albums.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves what a certain critic says about a certain album:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?criticName ?albumTitle ?reviewText
WHERE {
  ?critic a :Cl_Critic ;
          rdfs:label ?criticName ;
          :reviewsAlbum ?criticReview .
  
  ?criticReview a :Cl_CriticReview ;
                :reviewedAlbum ?album ;
                :reviewText ?reviewText .
  
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         rdfs:label ?albumTitle .
         
  # Uncomment and modify the following lines to specify a particular critic and album
  # FILTER(?criticName = "Brian Hiatt")
  # FILTER(?albumTitle = "Stadium Arcadium")
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The query selects the names of critics, album titles, and the review texts.
- It matches individuals of class `:Cl_Critic` and retrieves their names.
- It finds the reviews (`:Cl_CriticReview`) that the critic has via the `:reviewsAlbum` property.
- It retrieves the associated album and its title through the `:reviewedAlbum` property.
- The review text is obtained via the `:reviewText` property.
- Optionally, you can filter the results to a specific critic and album by using the `FILTER` clauses (uncomment and adjust them as needed).

**Note:** This query assumes that `rdfs:label` properties are used to store the names of critics and titles of albums. If your ontology uses different properties for names and titles, please adjust the query accordingly.
