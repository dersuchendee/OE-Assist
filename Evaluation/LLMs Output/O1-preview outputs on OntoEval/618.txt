```sparql
SELECT ?critic ?record ?reviewText
WHERE {
    ?review rdf:type :Cl_Review .
    ?review :reviewedBy ?critic .
    ?review :reviewOf ?record .
    ?review :reviewText ?reviewText .
}
```

This SPARQL query retrieves the critic, the record, and the review text from the ontology. It effectively answers the competency question "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" by extracting the relevant information from the `Cl_Review` instances, connecting them with the critic (`:reviewedBy`), the record (`:reviewOf`), and fetching the review content (`:reviewText`).
