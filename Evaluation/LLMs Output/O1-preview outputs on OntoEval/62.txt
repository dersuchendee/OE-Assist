```sparql
SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel
WHERE {
  ?process a :Process .
  ?process :involvesActor ?actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}
```

This SPARQL query retrieves all actors involved in any process within the circular value network as defined in the ontology. It selects actors (`?actor`) and their labels (`?actorLabel`) by traversing the `:involvesActor` object property from instances of `:Process` to instances of `:Actor`.
