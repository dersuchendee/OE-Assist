Answer: **Yes**

The given ontology defines the class `:Cl_PerformanceEvent` and the data property `:hasPerformanceDate`, which associates a performance event with its date. Therefore, we can retrieve the date of any performance event defined in the ontology. 

Here is the SPARQL query to find out when a certain performance took place:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performanceEvent ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performanceEvent a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?performanceEvent :hasPerformanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```

This query selects all performance events and their corresponding dates, effectively answering the competency question "When did a certain performance take place?".
