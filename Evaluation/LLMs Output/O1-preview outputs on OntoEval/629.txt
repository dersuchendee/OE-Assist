**Yes**

The competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_PerformanceEvent` with the data property `:hasPerformanceDate`, which records the date of the performance. There are instances of performance events in the ontology, such as `:PortlandPerformance`, which has an associated performance date.

Here's the SPARQL query to retrieve the dates of performances:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?performance :hasPerformanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```

This query selects all performance events and their dates from the ontology. If you want to find the date of a specific performance, for example, the "PortlandPerformance", you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  :PortlandPerformance rdf:type :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  :PortlandPerformance :hasPerformanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
```

This confirms that the ontology supports the competency question under the closed world assumption.
