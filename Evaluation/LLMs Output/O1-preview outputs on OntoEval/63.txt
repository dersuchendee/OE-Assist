**No**

The current ontology does not provide sufficient modeling to fully answer the competency question "What is the type of a specific resource?" While it defines the classes and properties related to resources and their types, it lacks the necessary connections or instances to determine the specific type of a resource. Specifically, there's no linkage between individual resources and their types using the `:hasType` property or instances of `:Cl_ResourceType`.

Here is a SPARQL query that extracts a partial answer by listing resources, but it cannot retrieve their types due to the incomplete modeling:

```sparql
SELECT ?resource
WHERE {
  ?resource a :Cl_Resource .
}
```
