Answer: **Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  ?performance :hasTimeInterval ?timeInterval .
  ?timeInterval :startDate ?startDate .
  ?timeInterval :endDate ?endDate .
}
```

This query retrieves all performances along with their start and end dates, effectively answering the competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" using the provided ontology.
