Answer: **Yes**.

The competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties related to performances and their dates, specifically the `:Cl_Performance` class and the `:performanceDate` property.

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve performances and their dates:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?date .
}
```

This query selects all instances of performances along with their associated dates, answering the competency question based on the ontology.
