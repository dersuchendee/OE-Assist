**Answer: Yes**

The Competency Question (CQ) "When did a certain performance take place?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_Performance` with the data property `:performanceDate`, which captures the date of each performance. This allows us to retrieve the date(s) of performances using a SPARQL query.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the performance dates:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?date .
}
```

This query retrieves all performances and their corresponding dates from the ontology.
