Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" is supported by the ontology. We can retrieve the performance dates of performances recorded in the ontology by querying instances of `:Cl_Performance` and their associated `:performanceDate`.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?date .
}
```
