The competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_Performance` with a data property `:performanceDate` that records the date of a performance. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the date of a specific performance.

Here is the SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?date .
}
```

If you want to find the date of a specific performance, for example, the Portland performance, you can specify it directly:

```sparql
SELECT ?date
WHERE {
  :PortlandPerformance :performanceDate ?date .
}
```

This query will return the date when `:PortlandPerformance` took place.
