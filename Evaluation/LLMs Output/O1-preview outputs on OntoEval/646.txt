Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_Performance` and the data property `:performanceDate`, which allows us to retrieve the date of a performance.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the date of a specific performance:

```sparql
SELECT ?date
WHERE {
  :SpecificPerformance a :Cl_Performance .
  :SpecificPerformance :performanceDate ?date .
}
```

Replace `:SpecificPerformance` with the URI of the performance you are interested in.

Alternatively, to retrieve the dates of all performances, you can use the following query:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?date .
}
```
