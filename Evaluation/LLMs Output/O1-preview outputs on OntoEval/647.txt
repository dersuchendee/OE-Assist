**Yes**

The competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology defines classes and properties related to performances and their dates.

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve the date of each performance:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?participation a :Cl_PerformanceParticipation .
  ?participation :performance ?performance .
  ?participation :performanceDate ?date .
}
```

This query selects all performances (`?performance`) and their corresponding dates (`?date`) by traversing through `:Cl_PerformanceParticipation` instances, which link performances to their dates via the `:performanceDate` property.
