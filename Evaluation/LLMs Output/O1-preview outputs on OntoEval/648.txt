**No**

We cannot directly link performances to the "Red Hot Chili Peppers" band using the given ontology, as there is no object property connecting `:Cl_Performance` to `:Cl_Band`. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question. However, we can extract a partial answer listing performances with their dates and locations.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?date ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedOn ?date .
  ?performance :performanceLocation ?location .
}
ORDER BY ?date
```
