Answer: **Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?component ?material
WHERE {
  :productX a :Cl_Product .
  :productX :hasComponent ?component .
  ?component :isComposedOf ?material .
}
```

This query retrieves the components of a specific product (`:productX`) by traversing the `:hasComponent` property from the product to its components and then using the `:isComposedOf` property to find the materials that each component is composed of.

If you want to retrieve components for all products, you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?product ?component ?material
WHERE {
  ?product a :Cl_Product .
  ?product :hasComponent ?component .
  ?component :isComposedOf ?material .
}
```

This will list all products along with their components and the materials those components are composed of.
