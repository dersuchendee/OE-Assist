Answer: **Yes**

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the songs played in each performance:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }

  ?performance :hasSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song
```
