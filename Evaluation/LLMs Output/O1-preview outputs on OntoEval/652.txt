**Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology includes classes and properties that connect performances to songs via the property `:hasPerformance`. Specifically, `:Cl_PerformanceEvent` instances are linked to `:Cl_MusicTrack` instances (songs) through the `:hasPerformance` property.

Here's the SPARQL query to retrieve the songs played in a certain performance:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?song ?songName
WHERE {
  # Specify the performance of interest
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  FILTER (?performance = :PortlandPerformance)
  
  # Find songs associated with the performance
  ?performance :hasPerformance ?song .
  ?song rdf:type :Cl_MusicTrack .
  
  # Optional: Get the song name if available
  OPTIONAL { ?song :hasName ?songName . }
}
```

This query selects the songs (`?song`) and their names (`?songName`) that were played during the specified performance (`:PortlandPerformance`). You can replace `:PortlandPerformance` with any other performance URI to get songs played in that performance.
