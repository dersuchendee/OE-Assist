Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" is supported by the ontology. We can write a SPARQL query to extract the songs performed at a given performance event.

Here's the SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?songPerformance a :Cl_SongPerformance .
  ?songPerformance :performedAt ?performance .
  ?songPerformance :performedSong ?song .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }

  FILTER (?performance = :SpecificPerformance)
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Classes and Properties Used:**
  - `:Cl_SongPerformance`: Represents the performance of a song.
  - `:performedAt`: Links a `:Cl_SongPerformance` to a `:Cl_Performance`.
  - `:performedSong`: Links a `:Cl_SongPerformance` to a `:Cl_Song`.
  - `:Cl_Performance`: Represents the performance event.
  - `:Cl_Song`: Represents the song that was performed.

- **Query Breakdown:**
  - We select the variables `?performance`, `?performanceLabel`, `?song`, and `?songLabel` to retrieve the performance and song information.
  - We find all instances of `:Cl_SongPerformance`.
  - We traverse the `:performedAt` property to get the specific performance we're interested in.
  - We traverse the `:performedSong` property to get the songs performed.
  - We use `OPTIONAL` clauses to get labels for better readability (if available).
  - The `FILTER` condition `(?performance = :SpecificPerformance)` ensures we retrieve songs for a particular performance. Replace `:SpecificPerformance` with the actual URI of the performance you're querying.

- **Notes:**
  - Ensure that the ontology includes instances of `:Cl_SongPerformance`, `:Cl_Performance`, and `:Cl_Song`, and that they are properly connected via the `:performedAt` and `:performedSong` properties.
  - The query operates under the Closed World Assumption, meaning it considers only the information explicitly provided in the ontology.

**Usage Example:**

If you have a performance event with the URI `:Performance_001`, replace `:SpecificPerformance` in the query with `:Performance_001`:

```sparql
FILTER (?performance = :Performance_001)
```

**Alternate Query Without Specific Performance:**

If you wish to retrieve songs for all performances, you can omit the `FILTER` clause:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?songPerformance a :Cl_SongPerformance .
  ?songPerformance :performedAt ?performance .
  ?songPerformance :performedSong ?song .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
```

This will return all songs performed at all performances recorded in the ontology.
