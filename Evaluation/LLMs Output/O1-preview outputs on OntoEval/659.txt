Here is the SPARQL query to retrieve the songs played in a certain performance:

```sparql
SELECT ?song
WHERE {
    # Replace <PERFORMANCE_URI> with the URI of the specific performance you're interested in
    BIND(<PERFORMANCE_URI> AS ?performance)
    
    ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
    ?performance :playedSong ?performanceSong .
    ?performanceSong a :Cl_PerformanceSong .
    ?performanceSong :songPlayed ?song .
    ?song a :Cl_Song .
}
```

This query works as follows:

- It selects all songs (`?song`) that were played during a specific performance (`?performance`).
- It starts by binding the specific performance URI to `?performance`.
- It ensures that `?performance` is an instance of `:Cl_Performance`.
- It uses the `:playedSong` property to find `?performanceSong` instances associated with the performance.
- It verifies that `?performanceSong` is an instance of `:Cl_PerformanceSong`, which connects performances and songs.
- It uses the `:songPlayed` property to find the songs (`?song`) associated with the performance song.
- It ensures that `?song` is an instance of `:Cl_Song`.

This query leverages the ontology's classes and properties to navigate from a performance to the songs played during that performance, thus confirming that the competency question is answerable using the provided ontology.
