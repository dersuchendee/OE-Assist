**Yes**

You can answer the competency question using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?song
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :hasSetlist ?setlist .
  ?setlist :includesSong ?song .
}
```

This query retrieves all performances along with the songs played during each performance.

If you want to find the songs played in a specific performance, for example, `:PerformanceStadiumArcadiumPortland`, you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?song
WHERE {
  :PerformanceStadiumArcadiumPortland :hasSetlist ?setlist .
  ?setlist :includesSong ?song .
}
```

This query will return all songs that were included in the setlist of the specified performance.
