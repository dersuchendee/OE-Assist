```sparql
SELECT ?song
WHERE {
  ?setlist :performedDuring :Performance_Portland .
  ?setlist :includesSong ?song .
}
```

This query retrieves the songs played during a specific performance (in this case, `:Performance_Portland`) by navigating the relationships defined in the ontology:
- `:setlist` is of type `:Cl_PerformanceSetlist` that is linked to the performance via `:performedDuring`.
- The songs included in the setlist are retrieved using the `:includesSong` property.

If you want the query to be applicable to any performance, you can use a variable for the performance:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?song
WHERE {
  ?setlist :performedDuring ?performance .
  ?setlist :includesSong ?song .
}
```

This version allows you to retrieve songs for all performances recorded in the ontology.
