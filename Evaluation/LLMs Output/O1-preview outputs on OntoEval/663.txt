**Yes**

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve the songs played in a certain performance, specifically the `:PortlandPerformance`:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?song ?songTitle
WHERE {
  # Find the performance setlist associated with the specific performance
  ?setlist :performedIn :PortlandPerformance .
  
  # Get the songs included in the setlist
  ?setlist :includesSong ?song .
  
  # Optionally retrieve the song's title if available
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songTitle . }
}
```

This query uses the ontology's classes and properties to navigate from a specific performance to the songs played during that performance. Under the closed world assumption, the ontology provides the necessary classes (`:Cl_Performance`, `:Cl_PerformanceSetlist`, `:Cl_Song`) and properties (`:performedIn`, `:includesSong`) to retrieve the required information.
