**Yes**

The competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" is answerable because the ontology includes the class `:Cl_Performance` and the property `:performedSongs` which links performances to songs. This allows us to retrieve the songs performed at a given performance.

SELECT ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  # Replace :performance1 with the specific performance of interest
  :performance1 a :Cl_Performance .
  :performance1 :performedSongs ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
