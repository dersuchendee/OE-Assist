```sparql
SELECT ?song
WHERE {
  # Specify the performance of interest
  # Replace :SpecificPerformance with the URI of the performance you're interested in
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  
  # If you have a specific performance, you can uncomment the following line and specify it
  # FILTER(?performance = :SpecificPerformance) 

  # Find the songs included in the performance
  ?performance :includesSong ?performedSong .
  
  # Get the song performed
  ?performedSong :songPerformed ?song .
