Answer: **Yes**.

We can answer the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" using the ontology provided, since there is a relationship between performances and songs through the `:featuresSong` object property, which connects `:Cl_Performance` instances to `:Cl_Song` instances.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the songs played in each performance:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?performance ?song
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :featuresSong ?song .
}
```

This query selects all performances and the songs featured in them by querying instances of `:Cl_Performance` and retrieving the associated `:Cl_Song` instances via the `:featuresSong` property.
