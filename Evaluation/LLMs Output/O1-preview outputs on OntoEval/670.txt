The competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes the classes and properties needed to represent songs, performances, and the relationships between them:

- **Classes**:
  - `:Cl_Song`: Represents songs.
  - `:Cl_Performance`: Represents performances.
  - `:Cl_SongPerformance`: Represents the event of a song being performed in a performance.

- **Object Properties**:
  - `:performedSong`: Links a `:Cl_SongPerformance` to a `:Cl_Song`.
  - `:inPerformance`: Links a `:Cl_SongPerformance` to a `:Cl_Performance`.

By querying the `:Cl_SongPerformance` instances that are associated with a specific performance (e.g., `:SpecificPerformance`), we can retrieve all the songs performed in that performance.

**Note**: Replace `:SpecificPerformance` with the actual identifier of the performance you're interested in.
