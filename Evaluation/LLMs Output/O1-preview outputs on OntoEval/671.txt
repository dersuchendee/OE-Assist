```sparql
SELECT ?song ?songTitle
WHERE {
  # Specify the performance of interest, e.g., with a known URI :GivenPerformance
  # or filter by date and location if available
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedSongs ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songTitle . }
  # If the performance is known:
  FILTER ( ?performance = :GivenPerformance )
  # If you need to filter by date or location, include these lines:
  # ?performance :performedOn ?date .
  # ?performance :performanceLocation ?location .
  # FILTER ( ?date = "2006-08-11"^^xsd:date && ?location = :Portland_Oregon )
}
