We can answer the competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" using the provided ontology because it includes information about performances and their locations. The ontology defines classes such as `Performance` and `Place`, and properties like `takesPlaceAt` that link performances to their locations.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the place where a performance took place:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?place ?placeName
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  
  ?performance :takesPlaceAt ?place .
  OPTIONAL { ?place :placeName ?placeName . }
}
```

This query selects all performances and retrieves the names of the places where they took place. If you're interested in a specific performance (e.g., `:Performance_RHCP_Portland_2006`), you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?placeName
WHERE {
  :Performance_RHCP_Portland_2006 :takesPlaceAt ?place .
  ?place :placeName ?placeName .
}
```
