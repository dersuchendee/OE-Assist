Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology models performances, performance events, and locations, and includes properties that connect these entities.

In the ontology, we have:

- **Classes**:
  - `:Cl_Performance` represents performances.
  - `:Cl_PerformanceEvent` represents performance events.
  - `:Cl_Location` represents locations.

- **Object Properties**:
  - `:performanceEvent` connects a performance (`:Cl_Performance`) to a performance event (`:Cl_PerformanceEvent`).
    - Domain: `:Cl_Performance`
    - Range: `:Cl_PerformanceEvent`
  - `:performedAt` connects a performance event (`:Cl_PerformanceEvent`) to a location (`:Cl_Location`).
    - Domain: `:Cl_PerformanceEvent`
    - Range: `:Cl_Location`

Given these classes and properties, we can traverse from a performance to its location via the performance event.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }

  ?performance :performanceEvent ?event .

  ?event a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?event :performedAt ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves:

- The performance (`?performance`) and its label (`?performanceLabel`), if available.
- The location (`?location`) where the performance took place and its label (`?locationLabel`), if available.

**Explanation**:

- We first select instances of `:Cl_Performance`.
- We use the `:performanceEvent` property to find the associated `:Cl_PerformanceEvent`.
- From the performance event, we use the `:performedAt` property to find the `:Cl_Location` where the performance took place.
- We include optional labels to make the output more readable.

This SPARQL query directly answers the competency question by leveraging the ontology's structure that connects performances to locations through performance events.
