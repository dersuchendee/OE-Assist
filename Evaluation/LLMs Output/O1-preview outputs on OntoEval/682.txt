**Yes**

Here the competency question is answerable because the ontology includes classes and properties that connect performances to their locations. Specifically, the ontology defines the `:Cl_Performance` and `:Cl_Location` classes, and the properties `:takesPlaceAt` and `:locationOf` link performances to locations.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :takesPlaceAt ?performanceLocation .
  ?performanceLocation :locationOf ?location .
}
```

This SPARQL query retrieves performances and their associated locations by navigating through the `:takesPlaceAt` and `:locationOf` properties as defined in the ontology. It starts from instances of `:Cl_Performance`, follows the `:takesPlaceAt` property to reach `:Cl_PerformanceLocation`, and then uses the `:locationOf` property to find the corresponding `:Cl_Location`.
