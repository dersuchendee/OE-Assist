**No**

The ontology lacks sufficient properties to fully answer the competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?". Specifically, while it connects performances to locations via the `:tookPlaceAt` property, it does not provide detailed information about the location such as city, region, or country. Therefore, under the closed world assumption, we cannot fully specify the place where a performance took place.

However, we can extract partial information about performances and their associated locations using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?performance ?performanceLocation
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :tookPlaceAt ?performanceLocation .
  ?performanceLocation a :Cl_Location .
}
```

This query retrieves performances and their associated locations but cannot provide more detailed location information.
