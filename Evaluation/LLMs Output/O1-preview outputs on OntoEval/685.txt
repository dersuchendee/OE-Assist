**Answer:** **Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?city
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedIn ?city .
}
```

This query retrieves all performances and their corresponding locations (cities) by selecting instances of `:Cl_Performance` and using the `:performedIn` property to find the associated city.
