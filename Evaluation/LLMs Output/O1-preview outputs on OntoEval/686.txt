The competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that model performances (`:Cl_Performance`), venues (`:Cl_Venue`), and the relation `:takesPlaceIn` which connects a performance to the venue where it occurred.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves performances and their locations:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?venue ?venueName ?city ?cityName ?region ?regionName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate . }
  ?performance :takesPlaceIn ?venue .
  OPTIONAL { ?venue rdfs:label ?venueName . }
  OPTIONAL { 
    ?venue :locatedIn ?city .
    OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityName . }
    OPTIONAL { 
      ?city :isLocatedIn ?region .
      OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionName . }
      OPTIONAL { 
        ?region :isPartOf ?country .
        OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryName . }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query retrieves all performances along with their dates and locations, including the venue, city, region, and country if available. The use of `OPTIONAL` allows for partial information if some location details are missing.
