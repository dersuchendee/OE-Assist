Answer: **Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
    ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
    ?performance :hasLocation ?location .
}
```

The competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the ontology because it includes information about performances and their locations through the `:hasLocation` property linking `:Cl_Performance` individuals to `:Cl_Location` individuals.
