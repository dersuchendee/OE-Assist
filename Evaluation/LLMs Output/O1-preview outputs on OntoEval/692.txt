Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes the class `:Cl_Performance` and the object property `:performanceLocation` that relates a performance to its location (`:Cl_Location`). Thus, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the location of any given performance.

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceLocation ?location .
}
```

This query selects all performances and their associated locations from the ontology.
