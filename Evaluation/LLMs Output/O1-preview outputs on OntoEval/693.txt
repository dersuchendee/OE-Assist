The CQ "Where did a certain performance take place?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology defines the necessary classes and properties to represent performances and their locations. Specifically, it includes the classes `:Cl_Performance`, `:Cl_PerformanceParticipation`, and `:Cl_Location`, along with the property `:performanceLocation` that relates a performance participation to a location.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract the locations of performances:

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?participation a :Cl_PerformanceParticipation ;
                 :performance ?performance ;
                 :performanceLocation ?location .
}
```

This query retrieves all performances and their associated locations by traversing the `:Cl_PerformanceParticipation` instances and accessing the `:performanceLocation` property.
