**No**

The competency question asks for the context of production of a source, specifically details like where, when, and who created the source. In the provided ontology, the class `:Source` does not have properties that link it directly to any information about its own context of production. The `:ContextOfProduction` class is associated with `:Organ` objects and represents the context in which an organ was produced, not a source.

While there is a pathway from `:Source` to `:OrganComponent` via the `:hasUnreliableInformation` property, and from `:OrganComponent` to `:Organ` via `:isComponentOf`, and then to `:ContextOfProduction`, this context relates to the organ, not the source itself. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the CQ with the given ontology.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves available information about sources, but it cannot provide the context of production:

```sparql
SELECT ?source
WHERE {
  ?source a :Source .
}
```
