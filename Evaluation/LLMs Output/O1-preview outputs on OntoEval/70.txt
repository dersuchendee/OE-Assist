```sparql
SELECT ?resource ?componentOrMaterial
WHERE {
  ?resource a :Resource .
  ?resource :hasComposition ?composition .
  ?composition :isComposedOf ?componentOrMaterial .
}
```

This query retrieves the composition of each resource by selecting resources that have a composition and then retrieving the materials or components that constitute that composition. If you have a specific resource in mind, you can modify the query to focus on that resource:

```sparql
SELECT ?componentOrMaterial
WHERE {
  :SpecificResource :hasComposition ?composition .
  ?composition :isComposedOf ?componentOrMaterial .
}
```

Replace `:SpecificResource` with the URI of the resource you're interested in. This query answers the competency question by providing the composition details of the specific resource as defined in the ontology.
