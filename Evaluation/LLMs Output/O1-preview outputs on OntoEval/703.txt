**No**

We cannot fully answer the competency question because the ontology lacks individual instances of cities and regions; it only defines classes and their relationships through restrictions. However, we can extract partial information about city classes and their associated region classes based on the subclass restrictions.

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve city classes and the regions they are associated with via the `:locatedIn` property:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city rdfs:subClassOf :Cl_City .
  ?city rdfs:subClassOf ?cityRestriction .
  
  ?cityRestriction owl:onProperty :locatedIn .
  ?cityRestriction owl:someValuesFrom ?region .
  
  ?region rdfs:subClassOf :Cl_Region .
}
```

This query selects city classes that are subclasses of `:Cl_City` and have a restriction indicating they are `:locatedIn` some region. It then retrieves the region classes that are subclasses of `:Cl_Region`.
