Answer: **Yes**

The CQ is answerable because the ontology includes `:Cl_City` and `:Cl_Region` classes, and properties that connect them via `:cityRegion` and `:regionOfCity`. Thus, it's possible to write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityRegion ?cityRegion .
  ?cityRegion :regionOfCity ?region .
}
```
