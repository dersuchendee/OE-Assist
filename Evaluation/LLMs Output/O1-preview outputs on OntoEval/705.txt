**No**

The competency question cannot be fully answered by the ontology because there is no direct property linking cities to regions. The properties `:locatedIn` and `:regionOf` involve the intermediate class `:Cl_CityRegion`, which is a subclass of both `:Cl_City` and `:Cl_Region`, but they do not provide a direct relationship between instances of cities and regions.

However, we can extract a partial answer by listing all the cities defined in the ontology.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?city
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
}
```
