The ontology includes classes `:Cl_City` and `:Cl_Region`, and the object property `:locatedInRegion` that connects instances of cities to their respective regions. Additionally, the ontology contains individuals such as `:Portland` (an instance of `:Cl_City`) and `:Oregon` (an instance of `:Cl_Region`), with the relationship `:Portland :locatedInRegion :Oregon`.
