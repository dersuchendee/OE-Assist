**Yes**

Because the ontology includes classes `:Cl_City` and `:Cl_Region`, and an object property `:locatedIn` connecting `:Cl_City` to `:Cl_Region`. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the regions where cities are located.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?region .
}
```
