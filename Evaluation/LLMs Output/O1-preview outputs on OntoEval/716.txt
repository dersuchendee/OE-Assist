Answer: **Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?country
WHERE {
  :YourRegion a :Cl_Region .
  :YourRegion :isInCountry ?country .
}
```

This query retrieves the country associated with a specific region (`:YourRegion`). Replace `:YourRegion` with the URI of the region you're inquiring about. The ontology supports this competency question as it includes the classes `:Cl_Region` and `:Cl_Country`, and the property `:isInCountry` that relates a region to the country it is located in.
