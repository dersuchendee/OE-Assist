Answer: **Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the ontology provided because cities are connected to regions through the properties `:locatedInRegion` and `:regionIncludes`. Here is the SPARQL query to retrieve the regions in which cities are located:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedInRegion ?cityRegion .
  ?cityRegion :regionIncludes ?region .
}
```
