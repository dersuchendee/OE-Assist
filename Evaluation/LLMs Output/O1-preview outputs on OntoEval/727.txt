**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between a region and its country that allows us to answer the competency question "In what country is a certain region located?". The properties `:regionCountry` and `:countryOfRegion` involve the class `:Cl_RegionCountry`, which is a subclass of both `:Cl_Region` and `:Cl_Country`, but there is no straightforward path from a region instance to its country.

A partial SPARQL query to list regions is:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?region
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
}
```

This query retrieves all instances of regions in the ontology, but does not provide the countries they are located in due to the missing direct relationship.
