The competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" can be answered using the ontology provided. Although there isn't a direct property connecting `:Cl_Region` directly to `:Cl_Country`, the ontology models this relationship via the reification class `:Cl_RegionCountry`, which acts as an association between regions and countries.

Here's the SPARQL query to retrieve the countries for given regions:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  ?region :locatedInCountry ?regionCountry .
  ?regionCountry :countryOf ?country .
  ?country a :Cl_Country .
}
```

This query works by:
1. Selecting all instances of regions (`?region`) that are of type `:Cl_Region`.
2. Using the `:locatedInCountry` property to find the associated `?regionCountry` instances.
3. From the `?regionCountry` instances, using the `:countryOf` property to find the corresponding `?country` instances.
4. Ensuring that `?country` is of type `:Cl_Country`.

By traversing these relationships, we can effectively determine the country in which a specific region is located, as modeled by the ontology.
