**Yes**

The CQ is answerable because the ontology models regions and their association to countries via the property `:regionInCountry`. Regions are instances of `:Cl_Region`, and countries are instances of `:Cl_Country`. The relationship between them allows us to query which country a certain region is located in.

Here is the SPARQL query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?regionName ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?region rdf:type :Cl_Region .
  ?region :locationName ?regionName .
  ?region :regionInCountry ?country .
  ?country :locationName ?countryName .
}
```
