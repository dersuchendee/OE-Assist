The CQ "In what country is a certain region located?" can be answered using the given ontology because it includes the classes `:Cl_Region` and `:Cl_Country`, and the object property `:regionInCountry` that relates a region to a country.

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve the country for each region:

```sparql
SELECT ?region ?regionLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionLabel . }

  ?region :regionInCountry ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Cl_Region`, retrieves their associated country via the `:regionInCountry` property, and optionally includes labels for better readability.
