Answer: **Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the ontology because it includes the necessary classes and properties to determine when a theatre festival took place. Specifically, the ontology defines the class `:TheatreFestival` with the property `:hasDate` that associates a festival with its date. Additionally, festivals have the `:hasName` property, allowing us to specify or list festivals by name.

Here is the SPARQL query to find out when theatre festivals took place:

```sparql
SELECT ?festivalName ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasName ?festivalName .
  ?festival :hasDate ?date .
}
```

This query retrieves the names and dates of all theatre festivals in the ontology. If you want to find the date of a specific festival, such as "Roma Loves Shakespeare," you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasName "Roma Loves Shakespeare" .
  ?festival :hasDate ?date .
}
```

This will provide the date when the specified theatre festival took place.
