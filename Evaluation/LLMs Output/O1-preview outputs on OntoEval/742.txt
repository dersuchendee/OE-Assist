**No**

Because the competency question cannot be directly answered via SPARQL over the data. The CQ refers to a modeling constraint specified in OWL class definitions, which cannot be queried directly with SPARQL. We can, however, extract partial information about albums and their tracks.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
    ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
    OPTIONAL { ?album :hasTrack ?track . }
}
```
