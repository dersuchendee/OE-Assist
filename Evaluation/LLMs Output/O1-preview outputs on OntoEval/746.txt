It appears that the OWL ontology code provided does not correspond with the Ontology Story (OS) and the Competency Question (CQ) given. The OS discusses music production involving the band "Red Hot Chili Peppers," and the CQ is:

**CQ:** *A record always contains at least one track.*

However, the OWL code provided relates to medical degrees, hospitals, unions, and seminars, which doesn't align with the music domain described in the OS and CQ.

To accurately verify whether the ontology models the CQ, we need the correct OWL ontology that pertains to music production, including classes such as `Record`, `Track`, and the relationships between them.

Could you please provide the appropriate OWL ontology code that corresponds to the OS and CQ about music production? This will allow us to determine if the CQ is supported by the ontology and to construct the relevant SPARQL query.
