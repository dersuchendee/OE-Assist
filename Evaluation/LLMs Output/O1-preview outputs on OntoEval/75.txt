**No**

Although the ontology includes festival occurrences with dates (`:Cl_FestivalOccurrence` with `:hasDate`), there is no property linking these occurrences back to the specific theatre festivals (e.g., to get the festival's name). Therefore, we cannot fully answer the CQ "When did a certain theatre festival take place?" as we cannot associate the dates with the names of the festivals. Here is a SPARQL query that extracts a partial answer by retrieving the dates of festival occurrences:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival rdf:type :Cl_FestivalOccurrence .
  ?festival :hasDate ?date .
}
```
