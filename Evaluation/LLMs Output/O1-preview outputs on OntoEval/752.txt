Answer: **No**

The ontology does not enforce that every record contains at least one track. There are no cardinality restrictions specified that require a `:Cl_Record` to have at least one `:Cl_Track`. Under the closed-world assumption, we cannot conclude that a record always contains at least one track based solely on the ontology.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract records and any tracks they may contain:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?record ?track
WHERE {
    ?record a :Cl_Record .
    OPTIONAL {
        ?record :containsTrack ?recordTrack .
        ?recordTrack :containedInRecord ?track .
    }
}
```
