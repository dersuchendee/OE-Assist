**Yes**

The ontology includes a restriction stating that every album (`:Cl_Album`) must have at least one track via the `:containsTrack` property pointing to a track (`:Cl_Track`). This correctly models the competency question that a record always contains at least one track.

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album rdf:type :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```

This SPARQL query retrieves all albums and their associated tracks, demonstrating that each album contains at least one track as specified by the ontology.
