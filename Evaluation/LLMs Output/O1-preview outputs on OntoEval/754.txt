**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track." is modeled by the ontology. This is represented in the ontology through the following OWL restriction:

```rdf
:Cl_Record owl:equivalentClass [
  rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
  owl:onProperty :containsTrack ;
  owl:someValuesFrom :Cl_Track
] .
```

This restriction states that every instance of `:Cl_Record` must have at least one `:containsTrack` relationship to an instance of `:Cl_Track`.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves this information from the ontology:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>

SELECT ?onProperty ?someValuesFrom
WHERE {
  :Cl_Record owl:equivalentClass ?restriction .
  ?restriction owl:onProperty ?onProperty .
  ?restriction owl:someValuesFrom ?someValuesFrom .
}
```

This query selects the properties involved in the restriction on `:Cl_Record`, showing that every record must contain at least one track.
