**Answer: Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is modeled in the ontology via the `owl:minCardinality 1` restriction on the `:containsTrack` property for the `:Cl_Album` class. This means every instance of `:Cl_Album` must have at least one associated track.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve all albums and their tracks, confirming that every album contains at least one track:

```sparql
SELECT ?album ?track
WHERE {
    ?album rdf:type :Cl_Album .
    ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
```

This query selects all albums (`?album`) that have at least one `:containsTrack` relationship to a track (`?track`). The presence of this data, along with the ontology's class restriction, supports the competency question under the closed world assumption.
