Answer: **Yes**

The ontology models that a record (album) always contains at least one track by defining `:Cl_Album` as equivalent to having at least one `:containsTrack` relationship with `:Cl_AlbumTrack`. This is specified using an `owl:equivalentClass` with a `owl:minCardinality` restriction of 1 on the `:containsTrack` property.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve this constraint from the ontology:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>

SELECT ?property ?cardinality
WHERE {
  :Cl_Album owl:equivalentClass ?restriction .
  ?restriction owl:onProperty ?property .
  ?restriction owl:minCardinality ?cardinality .
}
```

This query will return the property (`:containsTrack`) and the minimum cardinality (`1`), confirming that every album must contain at least one track according to the ontology.
