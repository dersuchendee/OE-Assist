**Yes**

The competency question "A record always contains at least one track" is supported by the ontology. The ontology models this by including a `minCardinality` restriction on the `:hasTrack` property for `:Cl_Album`, ensuring that every album has at least one track.

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve the restriction that enforces this:

```sparql
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?albumRestriction ?minCardinality
WHERE {
  :Cl_Album rdfs:subClassOf ?albumRestriction .
  ?albumRestriction rdf:type owl:Restriction .
  ?albumRestriction owl:onProperty :hasTrack .
  ?albumRestriction owl:minCardinality ?minCardinality .
}
```

This query will retrieve the restriction on `:Cl_Album` that specifies the minimum cardinality of `1` for the `:hasTrack` property, confirming that every album must have at least one track.
