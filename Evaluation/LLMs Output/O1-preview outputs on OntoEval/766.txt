The competency question "What medical degrees does a certain person have?" is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology defines classes for `Person`, `MedicalDegree`, and its subclasses (`NursingAssistantDegree` and `CertifiedNurseDegree`), as well as the object property `hasDegree` linking a person to their medical degrees. The individual `PasqualeDiGennaro` is an instance of `Person` and has degrees linked via the `hasDegree` property.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the medical degrees for each person in the ontology:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?degree ?degreeLabel
WHERE {
    ?person a :Person .
    OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
    ?person :hasDegree ?degree .
    OPTIONAL { ?degree rdfs:label ?degreeLabel . }
}
```

This query selects all individuals of type `Person` and retrieves the medical degrees they have via the `hasDegree` property. It also optionally retrieves labels for better readability.
