We can answer the competency question "What medical degrees does a certain person have?" using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the `ns1:Person` class, the `ns1:MedicalDegree` class, and the properties `ns1:hasDegree` and `ns1:hasMedicalDegree` that associate a person with their medical degrees.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the medical degrees for each person:

```sparql
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?degree ?degreeLabel
WHERE {
  ?person a ns1:Person .
  ?person ns1:hasDegree ?degree .
  ?degree a ns1:MedicalDegree .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?degree rdfs:label ?degreeLabel . }
}
```

This query selects all individuals of type `ns1:Person`, retrieves the medical degrees they have via the `ns1:hasDegree` property, ensures the degrees are indeed `ns1:MedicalDegree`, and optionally gets their labels for readability.
