Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "What medical degrees does a certain person have?" is supported by the ontology because it includes the necessary classes (`Cl_Person`, `Cl_MedicalDegree`) and the property `hasMedicalDegree` that relates a person to their medical degrees. Additionally, the datatype property `degreeName` allows us to retrieve the names of these degrees.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?medicalDegree ?degreeName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?medicalDegree .
  ?medicalDegree :degreeName ?degreeName .
}
```

This SPARQL query selects all persons and their associated medical degrees, retrieving the degree names for each. It leverages the `hasMedicalDegree` property to link a person with their medical degrees as defined in the ontology.
