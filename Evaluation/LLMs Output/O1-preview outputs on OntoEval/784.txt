The competency question "What medical degrees does a certain person have?" is supported by the ontology since there exists a direct relationship between a person and their medical degrees through the `:hasMedicalDegree` property. Here's a SPARQL query to extract the answer:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree
WHERE {
    ?person a :Cl_Person .
    ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
    ?degree a :Cl_MedicalDegree .
}
```

This query retrieves all individuals of type `:Cl_Person` and their associated medical degrees of type `:Cl_MedicalDegree`.
