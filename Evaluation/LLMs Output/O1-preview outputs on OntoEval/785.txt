**Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the ontology as it contains the necessary classes and properties to relate a person to their medical degrees via the class `:Cl_PersonMedicalDegree` and the properties `:hasPerson` and `:hasMedicalDegree`.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract the medical degrees held by a certain person:

```sparql
SELECT ?medicalDegree
WHERE {
  ?personMedicalDegree a :Cl_PersonMedicalDegree .
  ?personMedicalDegree :hasPerson :PersonOfInterest .
  ?personMedicalDegree :hasMedicalDegree ?medicalDegree .
}
```

Replace `:PersonOfInterest` with the specific person you're inquiring about.
