**Answer: Yes**

The competency question "What medical degrees does a certain person have?" is answerable using the given ontology. Even though the ontology uses a reification class `Cl_StudyForDegree` to represent the relationship between a person and their medical degree, we can retrieve the necessary information by navigating through this reified class.

Here is a SPARQL query that extracts the medical degrees of persons:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree
WHERE {
  ?study a :Cl_StudyForDegree .
  ?study :hasStudent ?person .
  ?study :hasDegree ?degree .
}
```

This query works as follows:

- It selects instances of the class `Cl_StudyForDegree`.
- From each `Cl_StudyForDegree` instance (`?study`), it retrieves the associated person (`?person`) via the `:hasStudent` property and the medical degree (`?degree`) via the `:hasDegree` property.

By executing this query, you can obtain the medical degrees associated with each person in the ontology.
