**No**

The ontology does not fully support the competency question because it lacks information about the time period during which a person studied for a specific degree. While it contains data about the degrees a person has obtained and the date of obtaining the degree (degreeObtainedDate), it does not include the start and end dates of the study periods.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract partial information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?degree ?degreeTitle ?degreeObtainedDate
WHERE {
    ?person rdf:type :Cl_Person .
    OPTIONAL { ?person :hasName ?personName . }
    ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
    ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle .
    OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeObtainedDate ?degreeObtainedDate . }
}
```

This query retrieves the person's name, the degrees they have obtained, the titles of those degrees, and the dates when the degrees were obtained, if available.
