This SPARQL query retrieves the time intervals during which persons participated in study events for specific degrees. It leverages the ontology's modeling of `StudyEvent`, which connects a `Person`, a `Degree`, and a `TimeInterval`. The query selects all instances where a person studied for a degree and extracts the start and end dates of that study period.
