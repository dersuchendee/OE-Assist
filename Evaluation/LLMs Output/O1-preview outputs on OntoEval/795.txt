Answer: **Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology models the required concepts and relationships. Specifically, the ontology includes:

- The class `:Cl_Person` to represent persons.
- The class `:Cl_Degree`, subclass of `:Cl_Education`, to represent degrees.
- The pivot class `:Cl_StudyingForDegree` (reification) to represent the study period of a person for a degree.
- Object properties `:studiedFor`, `:hasDegree`, `:startedStudying`, and `:endedStudying` to connect persons, study periods, degrees, and time periods.
- Data properties `:degreeName`, `:degreeDate` to capture degree details.

Therefore, we can retrieve the time periods during which a person studied for a specific degree using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?personName ?degreeName ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :personName ?personName .
  ?person :studiedFor ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod a :Cl_StudyingForDegree .
  ?studyPeriod :hasDegree ?degreeInstance .
  ?degreeInstance a :Cl_Degree .
  ?degreeInstance :degreeName ?degreeName .
  ?studyPeriod :startedStudying ?startDate .
  ?studyPeriod :endedStudying ?endDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the person's name, the degree name, and the start and end dates of the study period, satisfying the competency question.
