**No**

The ontology does not provide sufficient information to retrieve the time period during which a person studied for a specific degree. Specifically, there is no direct property connecting the `:Cl_PersonDegreeStudy` to a specific `:Cl_MedicalDegree`, which is necessary to answer the competency question fully.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?studyPeriod
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :studiedFor ?study .
  ?study a :Cl_PersonDegreeStudy .
  ?study :studyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
}
```

This query retrieves persons and their study periods, but it does not associate the study period with a specific degree due to the missing linkage in the ontology.
