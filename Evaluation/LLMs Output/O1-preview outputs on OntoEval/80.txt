Answer: **Yes**

The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to retrieve the dates when a certain theatre festival took place. Specifically:

- **Classes**:
  - `:Cl_TheatreFestival` - Represents a theatre festival.
  - `:Cl_FestivalEvent` - A subclass of `:Cl_TheatreFestival`, which has date properties.
- **Properties**:
  - `:festivalName` - A data property of `:Cl_TheatreFestival` to specify the name of the festival.
  - `:startDate` and `:endDate` - Data properties of `:Cl_FestivalEvent` to specify the dates when the festival takes place.

Given that `:Cl_FestivalEvent` is a subclass of `:Cl_TheatreFestival` and includes date properties, we can query for festivals by name and retrieve their start and end dates.

**SPARQL Query**:

```sparql
SELECT ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_FestivalEvent ;
            :festivalName "Roma Loves Shakespeare" ;
            :startDate ?startDate ;
            :endDate ?endDate .
}
```

This query will return the start and end dates for the festival named "Roma Loves Shakespeare".
