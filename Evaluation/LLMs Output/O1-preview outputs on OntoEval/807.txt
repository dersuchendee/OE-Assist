Answer: **No**

The ontology lacks the necessary properties to connect a specific person and a specific degree to the study period during which the person studied for that degree. While we can retrieve which degrees a person has using the `:hasMedicalDegree` property, we cannot retrieve the time period of study because there are no object properties connecting `:Cl_PersonDegreeStudy` to specific `:Cl_Person` and `:Cl_MedicalDegree` instances.

Partial SPARQL query to extract available information (persons and their degrees):

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree
WHERE {
  ?person rdf:type :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
}
```
