The competency question can be answered by the ontology since it includes the necessary classes and properties to represent the study periods of individuals for specific degrees. The class `:Cl_StudyForDegree` acts as a reification class connecting persons and degrees with their study periods.

Here is the SPARQL query to extract the study start and end dates for each person and degree:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?study rdf:type :Cl_StudyForDegree .
  ?study :hasStudent ?person .
  ?study :hasDegree ?degree .
  ?study :studyStartDate ?startDate .
  ?study :studyEndDate ?endDate .
}
```

If you want to find the study period for a specific person and a specific degree, you can parameterize the query as follows (replace `:PersonX` and `:DegreeY` with the appropriate URIs):

```sparql
SELECT ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?study rdf:type :Cl_StudyForDegree .
  ?study :hasStudent :PersonX .
  ?study :hasDegree :DegreeY .
  ?study :studyStartDate ?startDate .
  ?study :studyEndDate ?endDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the time period during which the specified person studied for the specified degree, as required by the competency question.
