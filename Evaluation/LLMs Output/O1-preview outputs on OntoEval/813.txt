**Yes**

The competency question "When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?" can be answered using the provided ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that model persons, their employment at hospitals, and the employment start dates.

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve the required information:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?personName ?hospital ?hospitalName ?employmentDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :isEmployedAt ?hospital ;
          :hasEmploymentStartDate ?employmentDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?person :hasName ?personName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital :hasName ?hospitalName . }
}
```

This query retrieves:

- `?person`: The URI of the person.
- `?personName`: The name of the person (if available).
- `?hospital`: The URI of the hospital where the person is employed.
- `?hospitalName`: The name of the hospital (if available).
- `?employmentDate`: The start date of the person's employment at the hospital.

**Explanation:**

- The `:isEmployedAt` property connects a person (`:Cl_Person`) to a hospital (`:Cl_Hospital`).
- The `:hasEmploymentStartDate` property provides the employment start date.
- The `:hasName` property provides optional labels for better readability.

**Therefore, the ontology supports the competency question, and the answer is affirmative.**
