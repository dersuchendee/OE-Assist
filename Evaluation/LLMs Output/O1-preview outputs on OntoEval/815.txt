Answer: **No**

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/hospital#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?startDate
WHERE {
    ?person a :Person .
    ?person :hasFirstEmployment ?firstEmployment .
    ?firstEmployment :hasStartDate ?startDate .
}
```

This query provides the first employment start date for a person but does not connect the employment to a specific hospital due to missing links in the ontology. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question with the given ontology.
