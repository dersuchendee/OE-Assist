**Yes**

The competency question, "When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?", is answerable using the provided ontology. The ontology contains the necessary classes and properties to model persons, hospitals, employments, and employment start dates.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the earliest employment start date of a specific person at a specific hospital:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?firstEmploymentDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Employment ;
              :hasEmployee :PersonX ;
              :hasEmployer :HospitalY ;
              :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
}
ORDER BY ?startDate
LIMIT 1
```

Replace `:PersonX` with the URI of the specific person (e.g., `:Pasquale_Di_Gennaro`), and `:HospitalY` with the URI of the specific hospital (e.g., `:Ospedale_Riunito_delle_Tre_Valli`). This query retrieves the earliest (first) employment start date of the person at the hospital by ordering the start dates and limiting the result to the first entry.

**Explanation:**

- **Classes Used:**
  - `:Person`: Represents individuals.
  - `:Hospital`: Represents hospitals and is a subclass of `:Organization`.
  - `:Employment`: Represents employment events linking a person to an organization with a start date.

- **Properties Used:**
  - `:hasEmployee`: Relates an employment to the person who is employed.
  - `:hasEmployer`: Relates an employment to the organization (hospital) that employs.
  - `:employmentStartDate`: The date when the employment began.

- **Query Logic:**
  - Find all employment instances where the `:hasEmployee` is the specific person and `:hasEmployer` is the specific hospital.
  - Retrieve the `:employmentStartDate` for these employments.
  - Order the results by `?startDate` to get the earliest date.
  - Use `LIMIT 1` to get the first (earliest) employment start date.

This query leverages the ontology's structure to directly answer the competency question, satisfying the requirement under the closed-world assumption.
