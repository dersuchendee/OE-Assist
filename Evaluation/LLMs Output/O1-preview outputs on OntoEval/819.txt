```sparql
SELECT (MIN(?employmentDate) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment :atHospital ?hospital .
  ?employment :employmentDate ?employmentDate .
  FILTER (?person = :CertainPerson)
  FILTER (?hospital = :CertainHospital)
}
```

This query retrieves the earliest employment date (`?firstEmploymentDate`) of a specific person (`:CertainPerson`) at a specific hospital (`:CertainHospital`). The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to answer the CQ:

- `:Cl_Person` class represents persons.
- `:Cl_Employment` class represents employment instances.
- `:Cl_Hospital` class represents hospitals.
- `:employedAt` property links a person to their employment(s).
- `:atHospital` property links an employment to a hospital.
- `:employmentDate` property provides the date of employment.

By querying these properties and applying the `MIN` function, we obtain the earliest (first) employment date of the person at the hospital, thus answering the competency question.
