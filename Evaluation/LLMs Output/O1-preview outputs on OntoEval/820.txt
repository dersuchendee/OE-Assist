**Yes**

Here the competency question is answerable because the ontology includes classes and properties that model persons, employments, hospitals, and employment start dates. Specifically, the ontology contains the classes `:Cl_Person`, `:Cl_Employment`, and `:Cl_Hospital`, as well as properties `:employedAt`, `:hospital`, and `:employmentStartDate`. These allow us to query for when a certain person was first employed at a certain hospital.

```sparql
SELECT (MIN(?employmentStartDate) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  # Bind the specific person and hospital of interest
  BIND(:InputPerson AS ?person) .
  BIND(:InputHospital AS ?hospital) .
  
  # Ensure ?person is a Cl_Person
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  
  # Find employments of the person
  ?person :employedAt ?employment .
  
  # Find the hospital associated with the employment
  ?employment :hospital ?hospital .
  
  # Get the employment start date
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
}
```

In this query, replace `:InputPerson` and `:InputHospital` with the URIs of the specific person and hospital you are interested in. This query retrieves the earliest (`MIN`) employment start date for the person at the hospital, effectively answering the question of when the person was first employed at that hospital.
