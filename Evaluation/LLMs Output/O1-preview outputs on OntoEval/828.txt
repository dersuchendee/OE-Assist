**Answer: Yes**

The ontology supports the competency question because it contains information about persons, their employments at hospitals, and the employment start dates. The `:Cl_Employment` class connects a person to a hospital through the `:employmentOf` and `:employedAt` object properties, and records the start date using the `:employmentStartDate` data property.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the employment start date of a specific person at a specific hospital:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?startDate
WHERE {
    ?employment rdf:type :Cl_Employment .
    ?employment :employmentOf :PasqualeDiGennaro .
    ?employment :employedAt :OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli .
    ?employment :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
}
```

To retrieve the employment start dates for all persons at all hospitals, you can use the following query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital ?startDate
WHERE {
    ?employment rdf:type :Cl_Employment .
    ?employment :employmentOf ?person .
    ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
    ?employment :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
}
```

This query will return all employment records, connecting each person to the hospital they were employed at, along with the employment start date.
