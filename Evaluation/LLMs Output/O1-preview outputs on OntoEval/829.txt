Answer: **Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?date
WHERE {
  ?employmentLink rdf:type :Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment .
  ?employmentLink :personEmployedAtHospital ?person .
  ?employmentLink :hospitalHasEmployee ?hospital .
  ?employmentLink :employmentStartedOn ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentDate ?date .
  
  FILTER (?person = :Person_X && ?hospital = :Hospital_Y)
}
ORDER BY ?date ASC
LIMIT 1
```

This query retrieves the earliest employment date of a specific person (`:Person_X`) at a specific hospital (`:Hospital_Y`). It navigates through the reification class `:Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment` to connect the person, hospital, and employment date, fulfilling the competency question.
