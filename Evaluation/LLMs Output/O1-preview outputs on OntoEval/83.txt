**No**

The ontology does not provide a property to identify a specific theatre festival (e.g., a name or label). Therefore, the competency question "When did a certain theatre festival take place?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology.

However, we can extract the dates of all theatre festivals using the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasDate ?date .
}
```
