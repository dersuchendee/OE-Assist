```sparql
SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?startDate) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment a :Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment .
  ?employment :hasHospital ?hospital .

GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
ORDER BY ?person ?hospital
```

This SPARQL query retrieves the earliest employment start date (`?firstEmploymentDate`) for each person-hospital pair. It leverages the ontology's classes and properties:

- `:Cl_Person` represents persons.
- `:Cl_Hospital` represents hospitals.
- `:Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment` reifies the employment relationship between a person and a hospital.
- `:hasEmployment` links a person to their employment(s).
- `:hasHospital` links an employment to the hospital.
- `:employmentStartDate` captures the start date of the employment.

By grouping the results by `?person` and `?hospital`, and using `MIN(?startDate)`, the query finds the earliest start date for each person at each hospital, thus answering the competency question.
