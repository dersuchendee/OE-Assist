Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "In what city is a certain hospital located?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes the class `ns1:Hospital` and the object property `ns1:locatedIn` which associates a hospital with the city it is located in. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve each hospital along with the city where it is located.

```sparql
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital a ns1:Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
  ?hospital ns1:locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}
```
