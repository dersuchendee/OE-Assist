Answer: **Yes**

The competency question "When did a certain theatre festival take place?" can be answered using the ontology, as it contains information about festivals and their occurrence dates.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the festivals and their dates:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival rdf:type :Cl_Festival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :hasDate ?date .
}
```
