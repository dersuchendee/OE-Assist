**No**

The ontology does not provide a direct connection between the main hospital individual `:Ospedale_Riunito_delle_Tre_Valli` and the city `:Nocera_Inferiore` via the `:locatedIn` property. Since there's no explicit `:locatedIn` relationship connecting the hospital to its city, we cannot answer the competency question under the closed world assumption.

However, we can extract the hospitals and attempt to find any associated locations:

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
    OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
  }
}
```

This query retrieves hospitals and any associated cities if the `:locatedIn` property is available. In this case, it may only return partial data due to the missing `:locatedIn` relationship for the main hospital individual.
