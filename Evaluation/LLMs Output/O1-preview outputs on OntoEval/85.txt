Answer: **Yes**

The ontology supports the competency question "When did a certain theatre festival take place?" because it includes the class `:Cl_TheatreFestival` with instances that have the date property `:dp_date`. This allows us to query the dates of theatre festivals present in the ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract the dates of theatre festivals:

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
    ?festival rdf:type :Cl_TheatreFestival .
    ?festival :dp_date ?date .
}
```

This query retrieves all individuals of type `:Cl_TheatreFestival` along with their associated dates when they took place.
