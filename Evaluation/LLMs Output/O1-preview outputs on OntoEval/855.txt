**Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology includes the classes `:Cl_Hospital` and `:Cl_City`, and the object property `:locatedIn` that connects hospitals to cities. This allows us to write a SPARQL query to retrieve hospitals and the cities they are located in.

```sparql
SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalName ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalName . }
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityName . }
}
```
