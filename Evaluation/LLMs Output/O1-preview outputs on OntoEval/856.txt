**Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology contains the class `:Cl_Hospital`, the class `:Cl_City`, and the object property `:locatedIn` which connects hospitals to cities (`rdfs:domain :Cl_Hospital ; rdfs:range :Cl_City`). This allows us to retrieve the city in which any given hospital is located.

```sparql

SELECT ?hospital ?city
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
}
