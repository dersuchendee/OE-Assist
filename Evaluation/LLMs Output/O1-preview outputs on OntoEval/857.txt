**Answer: Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the given ontology because it includes classes for cities and countries, the relationship between them, and specific instances (individuals) of cities and countries along with the `op_isLocatedIn` property connecting them.

Here is the SPARQL query to find out in which country a certain city is located:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :op_isLocatedIn ?country .
  ?country a :Cl_Country .
}
```

This query selects all pairs of cities and countries where the city is located in the country, according to the ontology provided.
