**Answer: Yes**

The CQ is answerable since the ontology provides a way to connect a city to a country through the reified class `:Cl_CityLocation`. Even though there isn't a direct property from `:Cl_City` to `:Cl_Country`, the reification allows us to retrieve the information needed.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :cityName ?cityName . }
  
  ?city :cityLocation ?cityLocation .
  ?cityLocation :locationCountry ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?country :countryName ?countryName . }
}
```

This query retrieves cities and their associated countries by traversing the reified relationships in the ontology.
