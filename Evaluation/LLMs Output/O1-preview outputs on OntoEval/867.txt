The competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" can be answered using the ontology because the ontology includes the classes `Cl_City` and `Cl_Country`, and the object property `:locatedIn` that connects a city to a country.

Here's the SPARQL query to retrieve the country in which a given city is located:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
    ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
    OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityName . }
    ?city :locatedIn ?country .
    ?country rdf:type :Cl_Country .
    OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryName . }
    
    FILTER( ?cityName = "Nocera Inferiore" )
}
```

This query selects the country that the city "Nocera Inferiore" is located in. It uses the `:locatedIn` property to navigate from a city to its country, leveraging the ontology's structure to provide the answer.
