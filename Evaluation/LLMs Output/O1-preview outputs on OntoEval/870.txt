Answer: **Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology includes the classes `:Cl_City` and `:Cl_Country`, and the object property `:isLocatedIn` which relates a city to the country it is located in. Therefore, we can write the following SPARQL query to extract the information:

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
    ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
    ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
}
```
