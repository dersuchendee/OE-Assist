Answer: **Yes**

The ontology contains the necessary classes and properties to determine the country in which a given city is located. Specifically, it includes:

- **Classes**: `:Cl_City`, `:Cl_Country`, and `:Cl_CityLocation`.
- **Object Properties**: `:cityLocatedIn` (linking `:Cl_CityLocation` to `:Cl_Country`) and `:cityLocationOf` (linking `:Cl_CityLocation` to `:Cl_City`).
- **Data Properties**: `:cityName`, `:countryName`.

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve the country in which each city is located:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?cityName ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City ;
        :cityName ?cityName .

  ?cityLocation rdf:type :Cl_CityLocation ;
                :cityLocationOf ?city ;
                :cityLocatedIn ?country .

  ?country rdf:type :Cl_Country ;
           :countryName ?countryName .
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The query selects the names of cities and their corresponding countries.
- It retrieves all individuals of type `:Cl_City` and gets their `:cityName`.
- It finds the `:Cl_CityLocation` that links each city to a country via the properties `:cityLocationOf` and `:cityLocatedIn`.
- It retrieves the `:countryName` of each country.

This query will return the following result based on the ontology data:

| cityName          | countryName |
|-------------------|-------------|
| "Nocera Inferiore" | "Italy"     |

This satisfies the competency question, confirming that the ontology models the required information.
