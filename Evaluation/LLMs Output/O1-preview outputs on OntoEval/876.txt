**Yes**

The ontology includes classes for cities (`:Cl_City`) and countries (`:Cl_Country`), as well as an object property `:isLocatedIn` that links a city to the country it is located in. Thus, we can write a SPARQL query to answer the competency question.

```sparql
SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?country ?countryLabel WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
}
```
