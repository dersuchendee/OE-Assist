Answer: **No**

The provided ontology does not include properties or relationships that specify the union an employee is a member of, nor does it include temporal data about union memberships to determine membership at a certain point in time. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered using the ontology.

Here is a partial SPARQL query that retrieves employees who have union memberships, but it cannot filter by a certain union or point in time:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.hospitalontology.org/ontologies/hospital.owl#>
PREFIX collectionentity: <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/collectionentity.owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?employee ?employeeName ?unionMembership
WHERE {
  ?employee a :Employee .
  OPTIONAL { ?employee rdfs:label ?employeeName . }
  ?employee :hasUnionMembership ?unionMembership .
}
```

This query retrieves the employees and their union memberships but lacks the necessary temporal and union-specific information to fully answer the competency question.
