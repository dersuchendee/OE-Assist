This query retrieves all members (`?member`) of a specific union (`:UnionOfMaleNurses`) who were members at a given date (`?givenDate`). It checks if the given date is after the membership's start date (`?startDate`) and before the end date (`?endDate`), if an end date exists. The `:Cl_UnionMembership` class connects members to unions with associated dates, allowing us to answer the competency question using the provided ontology.
