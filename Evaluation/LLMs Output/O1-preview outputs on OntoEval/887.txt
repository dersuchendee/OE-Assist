**No**

The ontology provided lacks the necessary connections and properties to fully support the competency question: *"Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?"* Specifically, the ontology does not adequately link employees to unions with explicit time periods for their memberships.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer (listing employees and the unions they are associated with, without time constraints):

```sparql
SELECT ?employee ?union
WHERE {
  ?employee rdf:type :Cl_Employee .
  ?union rdf:type :Cl_Union .
  ?union :hasMember ?member .
  ?member :memberOf ?union .
  ?employee :hasUnionMembership ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?membership :hasMember ?member .
}
```

This query retrieves employees and the unions they are associated with but does not factor in the time periods of their membership due to the missing connections in the ontology.
