Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the members of a specific union at a certain point in time:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :union :SpecificUnion .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate . }

  FILTER ( xsd:date("YYYY-MM-DD") >= ?startDate ) .
  FILTER ( !BOUND(?endDate) || xsd:date("YYYY-MM-DD") <= ?endDate ) .
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Namespaces:**
  - We define the necessary prefixes for the ontology.
- **Variables:**
  - `?person`: Individuals of type `:Cl_Person`.
- **Triple Patterns:**
  - `?person a :Cl_Person`: Selects all persons.
  - `?person :memberOf ?membership`: Retrieves the union memberships of each person.
  - `?membership :union :SpecificUnion`: Filters memberships to the specific union of interest (replace `:SpecificUnion` with the actual union URI).
  - `?membership :membershipStartDate ?startDate`: Retrieves the start date of the membership.
  - `OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate }`: Optionally retrieves the end date if it exists.
- **Filters:**
  - `FILTER ( xsd:date("YYYY-MM-DD") >= ?startDate )`: Ensures the point in time (replace `"YYYY-MM-DD"` with the specific date) is after the membership started.
  - `FILTER ( !BOUND(?endDate) || xsd:date("YYYY-MM-DD") <= ?endDate )`: Includes memberships that are still active or ended after the point in time.
  
**Note:** Replace `:SpecificUnion` with the actual URI of the union in question, and `"YYYY-MM-DD"` with the specific date you are interested in.

This query utilizes the classes and properties defined in the ontology to answer the competency question by finding all persons who are members of a particular union at a specified point in time.
