**Yes**

Here is the SPARQL query to answer the competency question:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?personName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personName . }

  ?person :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?membership :memberOf ?union .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?startDate .

  FILTER(?union = :SpecificUnionURI && ?startDate <= xsd:dateTime("YYYY-MM-DD"))
}
```

Replace `:SpecificUnionURI` with the URI of the specific union you're interested in, and `"YYYY-MM-DD"` with the date you're querying.

This query retrieves all persons who are members of a certain union at a certain point in time by checking the membership start date and assuming continuous membership unless specified otherwise, as per the closed world assumption.
