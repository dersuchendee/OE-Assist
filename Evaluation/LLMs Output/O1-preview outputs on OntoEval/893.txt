The ontology supports querying for members of a certain union at a certain point in time using the union membership information, which includes the membership start date.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the members of a specific union at a given date:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person
WHERE {
  ?person rdf:type :Cl_Person .
  ?person :isMemberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :memberOf :YourUnionURI .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
  
  FILTER ( ?startDate <= xsd:date("YourDateOfInterest") )
}
```

Replace `:YourUnionURI` with the URI of the union you're interested in (e.g., `:UnionOfMaleNurses`), and `"YourDateOfInterest"` with the date you're querying for (e.g., `"2005-01-01"`).

This query selects all persons whose union membership in the specified union started on or before the given date, effectively retrieving the union members at that point in time.
