**Answer: Yes**

The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to determine who are the members of a certain union at a specific point in time. The union memberships are represented as instances of `:Cl_UnionMembership`, which associate a `:unionMember` (person) with a `:memberOfUnion` (union), along with `:membershipStartDate` and optionally `:membershipEndDate`.

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the members of a specified union at a given date:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personLabel
WHERE {
  # Specify the union and date of interest
  BIND (:Union_Male_Nurses AS ?union)  # Replace with the URI of the desired union
  BIND ("2003-05-15"^^xsd:date AS ?queryDate)  # Replace with the desired date

  # Find union memberships matching the union and active on the query date
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :unionMember ?person ;
              :memberOfUnion ?union ;
              :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate . }

  # Filter memberships active at the query date
  FILTER ( ?startDate <= ?queryDate && ( !bound(?endDate) || ?queryDate <= ?endDate ) )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The query binds the specific union and date of interest using `BIND`. Replace `:Union_Male_Nurses` and `"2003-05-15"^^xsd:date` with the appropriate union URI and date.
- It selects persons who are members of the specified union whose membership includes the query date.
- The `FILTER` ensures that the `?queryDate` falls between the `?startDate` and `?endDate` of the membership. If `?endDate` is not bound (i.e., the membership is ongoing), it includes those memberships as well.
- `OPTIONAL` is used to retrieve labels for the persons when available.

**Note:** You can parameterize the `?union` and `?queryDate` variables to make the query reusable for different unions and dates.
