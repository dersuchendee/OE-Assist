Answer: **Yes**

The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to answer the competency question: "Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?"

Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the persons who are members of a specific union during a given date:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_PersonUnionMembership ;
          :memberOf :SpecificUnion ;
          :membershipStartDate ?startDate ;
          :membershipEndDate ?endDate .
  FILTER ( xsd:date("2021-01-01") >= ?startDate && xsd:date("2021-01-01") <= ?endDate )
}
```

**Notes:**

- Replace `:SpecificUnion` with the URI of the union you're interested in.
- Replace `"2021-01-01"` with the date for which you want to check the membership.

This query works because:

- `:Cl_PersonUnionMembership` is a reification class that represents the membership of a person in a union.
- Each membership instance is associated with a `:memberOf` property linking it to the union.
- The membership period is captured using `:membershipStartDate` and `:membershipEndDate`.
- Since `:Cl_PersonUnionMembership` is a subclass of `:Cl_Person`, each instance also represents a person.
- The `FILTER` ensures that only memberships active on the specified date are retrieved.
