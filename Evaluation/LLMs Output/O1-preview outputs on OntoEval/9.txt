Answer: **Yes**

The competency question is supported by the ontology since it includes the `:Source` class, the `:ContextOfUsage` class, and the object property `:hasContextOfUsage` linking a source to its context of usage.

Here is the SPARQL query to retrieve the context of usage of each source:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?source ?sourceLabel ?contextOfUsage ?contextLabel
WHERE {
  ?source a :Source .
  OPTIONAL { ?source rdfs:label ?sourceLabel . }
  ?source :hasContextOfUsage ?contextOfUsage .
  OPTIONAL { ?contextOfUsage rdfs:label ?contextLabel . }
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Source` and retrieves their associated contexts of usage through the `:hasContextOfUsage` property, along with any available labels for better readability.
