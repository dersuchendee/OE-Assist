This SPARQL query retrieves all persons who are members of a specific union at a specific point in time. The ontology supports this query because it includes the classes and properties related to union membership, specifically:

- `:Cl_UnionMembership` represents the membership instances.
- `:hasUnion` links a membership instance to a union.
- `:hasPerson` links a membership instance to a person.
- `:membershipStartDate` and `:membershipEndDate` provide the temporal validity of the membership.

By querying the `:Cl_UnionMembership` class and filtering based on the provided date, we can accurately determine the members of a union at that time, satisfying the competency question under the closed-world assumption.
