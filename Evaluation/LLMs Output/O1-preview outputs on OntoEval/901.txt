Here is a SPARQL query to find the members of a specific union at a certain point in time:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?member
WHERE {
  # Replace :UnionX with the union of interest, or bind ?union to the desired URI
  # Replace "YYYY-MM-DD"^^xsd:date with the specific date of interest
  BIND (:UnionX AS ?union) .
  BIND ("YYYY-MM-DD"^^xsd:date AS ?date) .

  # Union membership
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?membership :hasMember ?member .
  ?membership :memberOf ?union .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?startDate .

  # Optional membership end date
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate . }

  # Filter memberships active at the given date
  FILTER (
    ?startDate <= ?date &&
    ( !BOUND(?endDate) || ?date <= ?endDate )
  )
}
```

This query selects all members (`?member`) who are part of the specified union (`?union`) during the specified date (`?date`). It checks the membership's start and optional end dates to ensure the membership was active on that date.
