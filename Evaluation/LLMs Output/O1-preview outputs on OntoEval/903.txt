This SPARQL query retrieves the role (`?role`) that a specific person (`?person`) has within a specific union group (`?unionGroup`) at a specific point in time (`?time`). It checks the `roleStartDate` and `roleEndDate` to ensure that the role membership is valid at the given time. The query assumes that the variables `?specifiedPerson`, `?specifiedUnionGroup`, and `?specifiedTime` are provided with the specific values for the person, union group, and time you are inquiring about.
