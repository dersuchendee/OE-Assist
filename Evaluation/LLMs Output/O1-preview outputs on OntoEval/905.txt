Answer: **Yes**

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the roles that a person has within a union group at a certain point in time:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?role ?unionGroup ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person :hasName ?personName . }

  ?person :hasRoleMembership ?roleMembership .
  ?roleMembership a :Cl_UnionRoleMembership .
  ?roleMembership :roleOfMembership ?role .
  ?roleMembership :roleMembershipIn ?unionGroup .

  ?roleMembership :roleStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?roleMembership :roleEndDate ?endDate . }

  # Replace "YYYY-MM-DD" with the desired date
  FILTER( ?startDate <= xsd:date("YYYY-MM-DD") &&
          ( !bound(?endDate) || xsd:date("YYYY-MM-DD") <= ?endDate ) )
}
```

This query retrieves the person, their role within a union group, and the start and end dates of that role membership. By filtering with a specific date (replace `"YYYY-MM-DD"` with the desired date), you can find out what role a person had in a union group at that point in time.

The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to model this information:

- **Classes**: `:Cl_Person`, `:Cl_UnionRole`, `:Cl_UnionGroup`, `:Cl_UnionRoleMembership`
- **Object Properties**:
  - `:hasRoleMembership` links a person to their role membership events.
  - `:roleOfMembership` specifies the role involved in the membership.
  - `:roleMembershipIn` links the role membership to a union group.
- **Data Properties**:
  - `:roleStartDate` and `:roleEndDate` capture the time period of the role membership.

Therefore, the competency question is answerable using the provided ontology.
