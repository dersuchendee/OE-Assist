**No**

The ontology does not provide temporal information associated with the roles that a person holds within a union at specific points in time. While we have information about persons, unions, roles, and membership periods, the specific time points when a person holds a particular role within a union are not modeled in the ontology. The `ns1:hasRole` property does not include temporal qualifiers, and there is no mechanism to associate time intervals with roles.

Here is a SPARQL query to extract partial information about persons, their roles within unions, and union memberships:

```sparql
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX time: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#>
PREFIX xsd:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?personName ?union ?unionName ?role ?roleName ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?person a ns1:Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person foaf:name ?personName . }

  OPTIONAL {
    ?person ns1:memberOf ?unionMembership .
    ?unionMembership ns1:hasUnion ?union .
    OPTIONAL { ?union rdfs:label ?unionName . }

    OPTIONAL {
      ?unionMembership ns1:hasMembershipPeriod ?membershipPeriod .
      ?membershipPeriod time:hasBeginning ?membershipStart .
      OPTIONAL { ?membershipPeriod time:hasEnd ?membershipEnd . }
    }
  }

  OPTIONAL {
    ?person ns1:hasRole ?role .
    ?role a ns1:UnionRole .
    OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleName . }
    ?role ns1:roleInUnion ?union .
  }
}
```

This query retrieves:

- Persons and their names.
- Unions and their names that the persons are members of.
- Roles that the persons have within unions.
- Membership start and end dates (if available).

**Note:** The query provides partial information because it lacks the temporal association between the roles and specific points in time. Without modeling the temporal aspect of role assignments (e.g., using a reified relationship or associating time intervals with `ns1:hasRole`), we cannot fully answer the competency question.
