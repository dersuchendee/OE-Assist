Answer: **No**

The given ontology lacks the temporal aspect associated with a person's role within a union. While it defines classes and properties related to `Person`, `Role`, and `Union`, and even temporal properties for membership (`:hasMemberAt`, `:memberOfAt`), there is no property that links a person's role within a union to a specific point in time. 

To extract a partial answer (the role of a person within a union without considering the time), we can use the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?personName ?role ?roleName ?union ?unionName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personName . }
  
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleName . }
  
  ?role :withinUnion ?union .
  OPTIONAL { ?union rdfs:label ?unionName . }
}
```

This query retrieves the person, their role, and the union associated with that role. However, since the ontology does not associate the role with a specific time, we cannot answer the CQ fully.
