SELECT ?role
WHERE {
  # Given inputs: ?person, ?union, and ?queryTime (as xsd:dateTime)
  
  ?assignment a :UnionRoleAssignment ;
               :hasAgent ?person ;
               :inUnion ?union ;
               :hasRole ?role ;

  ?timeInterval :startDate ?startDate ;
                :endDate ?endDate .
  
  FILTER ( ?queryTime >= ?startDate && ?queryTime <= ?endDate )
}
```

This query retrieves the role (`?role`) that a specific person (`?person`) has within a specific union (`?union`) at a certain point in time (`?queryTime`). It matches the `UnionRoleAssignment` where:

- The assignment involves the given person (`:hasAgent ?person`).
- The assignment is within the given union (`:inUnion ?union`).
- The assignment has a role (`:hasRole ?role`).
- The assignment is valid during a time interval that includes the given time (`?queryTime` falls between `:startDate` and `:endDate`).

This aligns with the ontology provided, utilizing the classes and properties related to union role assignments and time intervals.
