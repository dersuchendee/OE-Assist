**No**

The CQ cannot be fully answered because the ontology does not include a data property for the theatre festival name or a way to identify a specific festival. Therefore, we cannot specify "a certain theatre festival" in the query. However, we can retrieve the occurrence dates of all theatre festivals present in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :occurrenceDate ?date .
}
```
