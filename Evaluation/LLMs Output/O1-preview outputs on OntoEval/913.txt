**No**

The CQ cannot be fully answered using the given ontology because there is no property or class that directly represents the name or type of the role that a person has within a union group. The ontology defines the classes and relationships between `Cl_Person`, `Cl_Union`, and `Cl_UnionRole`, and includes the date of the role (`:roleDate`), but it lacks a property to specify the role's name or type. Under the Closed World Assumption, we cannot infer information that is not explicitly modeled in the ontology.

However, we can extract a partial answer that shows which persons have roles in which unions at certain points in time.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?union ?date
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasRole ?unionRole .
  ?unionRole a :Cl_UnionRole .
  ?unionRole :hasRole ?union .
  ?union a :Cl_Union .
  ?unionRole :roleDate ?date .
}
```

This query retrieves the person, the union they have a role with, and the date of the role, but it cannot provide the specific role that the person holds within the union.
