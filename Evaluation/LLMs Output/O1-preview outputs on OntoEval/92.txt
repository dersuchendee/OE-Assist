Answer: **No** partial answer:

The CQ cannot be fully answered because the ontology does not provide a way to specify a particular theatre festival (e.g., by name). However, we can retrieve all theatre festivals and their occurrence dates.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?occurrenceDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :occurrenceDate ?occurrenceDate .
}
```
