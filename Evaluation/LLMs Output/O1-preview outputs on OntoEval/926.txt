**No**

The competency question cannot be fully answered using the given ontology because there is no individual of type `:Cl_Doctor` defined. Specifically, `:Doctor1` is referenced in the ontology but is not declared as an instance of `:Cl_Doctor` or provided with any properties (such as a name). Under the closed world assumption, this means we lack the necessary information to identify the doctor who gave the evaluation statement.

However, we can extract a partial answer that includes the evaluation statements and the employees they evaluate, even though we cannot provide details about the doctor.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?evaluation ?evaluationDate ?evaluationContent ?employeeName
WHERE {
  ?evaluation a :Cl_EvaluationStatement .
  ?evaluation :evaluatesEmployee ?employee .
  ?employee :hasName ?employeeName .
  OPTIONAL { ?evaluation :hasEvaluationDate ?evaluationDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?evaluation :hasEvaluationContent ?evaluationContent . }
}
```

This query retrieves:

- `?evaluation`: The evaluation statement.
- `?evaluationDate`: The date of the evaluation (if available).
- `?evaluationContent`: The content of the evaluation (if available).
- `?employeeName`: The name of the employee being evaluated.

Since we cannot retrieve information about the doctor who wrote the evaluation (due to the absence of `:Doctor1` as a defined individual with properties), we cannot fully answer the competency question.
