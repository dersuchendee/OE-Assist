```sparql
SELECT ?doctor ?employee ?evaluation_text
WHERE {
  ?evaluation_event a :Cl_EvaluationEvent .
  ?evaluation_event :evaluation_text ?evaluation_text .
  
  ?doctor a :Cl_Doctor ;
          :conducts_evaluation_event ?evaluation_event .
  
  ?employee a :Cl_Employee ;
            :undergoes_evaluation_event ?evaluation_event .
}
```

This query retrieves the evaluation statements (`?evaluation_text`) given by doctors (`?doctor`) to employees (`?employee`). It utilizes the relationships defined in the ontology:

- **`:conducts_evaluation_event`** links a doctor to the evaluation event they conducted.
- **`:undergoes_evaluation_event`** links an employee to the evaluation event they underwent.
- **`:evaluation_text`** provides the text of the evaluation.

The query selects all instances where a doctor has conducted an evaluation event that an employee has undergone, retrieving the associated evaluation text.
