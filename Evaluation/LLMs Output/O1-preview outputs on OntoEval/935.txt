Answer: **Yes**

The competency question is answerable because the ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to represent evaluations given by doctors to employees. Specifically, we have:

- `:Cl_Employee` and `:Cl_Doctor` classes representing employees and doctors.
- `:evaluatedBy` property connecting an employee to an evaluation.
- `:doctor` property connecting an evaluation to a doctor.
- `:evaluationStatement` property holding the content of the evaluation.

Here's a SPARQL query to extract the evaluation statements given by doctors for employees:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?employee ?doctor ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  ?employee a :Cl_Employee .
  ?employee :evaluatedBy ?evaluation .
  ?evaluation :doctor ?doctor .
  ?evaluation :evaluationStatement ?evaluationStatement .
}
```

This query retrieves all employees who have been evaluated (`:evaluatedBy`), the evaluations they have received, the doctors who provided these evaluations, and the evaluation statements themselves.
