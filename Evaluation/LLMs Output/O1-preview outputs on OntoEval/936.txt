**No**

The ontology does not provide a property that connects evaluations to employees. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the competency question "What is the evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee?". However, we can partially retrieve evaluation statements given by doctors.

```sparql
SELECT ?doctor ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  ?doctor a :Cl_Doctor .
  ?doctor :givesEvaluation ?evaluation .
  ?evaluation :evaluationStatement ?evaluationStatement .
}
```
