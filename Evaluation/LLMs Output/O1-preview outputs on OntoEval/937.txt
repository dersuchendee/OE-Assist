**Answer: No**

The competency question cannot be fully answered because the ontology lacks instances of `Cl_EvaluationStatement` and `Cl_Doctor`. Therefore, we cannot retrieve evaluation statements given by doctors to employees. However, we can extract partial information about employees in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?employee ?employeeName
WHERE {
  ?employee rdf:type :Cl_Employee .
  OPTIONAL { ?employee rdfs:label ?employeeName . }
}
```
