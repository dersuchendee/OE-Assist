**No**

The ontology does not provide properties to uniquely identify a specific theatre festival (e.g., by name or identifier). Therefore, we cannot answer "When did a certain theatre festival take place?" completely. However, we can extract the dates of theatre festivals present in the ontology.

Partial SPARQL query:

```sparql
SELECT ?theatreFestival ?date
WHERE {
  ?theatreFestival rdf:type :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?theatreFestival :hasDate ?date .
}
```
