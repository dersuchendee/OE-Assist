**Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the ontology provided. Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the evaluation statements given by doctors to employees:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?doctor ?doctorName ?employee ?employeeName ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  ?evaluation rdf:type :Cl_Evaluation ;
              :evaluatedBy ?doctor ;
              :evaluates ?employee ;
              :evaluationStatement ?evaluationStatement .
  OPTIONAL { ?doctor rdfs:label ?doctorName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?employee rdfs:label ?employeeName . }
}
```

This query selects all evaluation statements along with the associated doctor and employee. It utilizes the following classes and properties from the ontology:

- Classes:
  - `:Cl_Evaluation`
  - `:Cl_Doctor`
  - `:Cl_Employee`
- Object Properties:
  - `:evaluatedBy`
  - `:evaluates`
- Datatype Properties:
  - `:evaluationStatement`
- Individuals:
  - `:Dr_Smith` (an instance of `:Cl_Doctor`)
  - `:Pasquale_Di_Gennaro` (an instance of `:Cl_Person`, presumably a `:Cl_Employee`)

**Explanation:**

- The query looks for all instances of `:Cl_Evaluation`.
- For each evaluation, it retrieves:
  - The doctor who evaluated (`:evaluatedBy`).
  - The employee who was evaluated (`:evaluates`).
  - The evaluation statement (`:evaluationStatement`).
- `OPTIONAL` clauses are used to get labels (`rdfs:label`) for the doctor and employee if they are available.

**Note:** This SPARQL query assumes that the ontology includes instances and that the properties are used as specified. Under the closed-world assumption, since all the necessary classes, properties, and individuals are defined in the ontology, the competency question is fully supported.
