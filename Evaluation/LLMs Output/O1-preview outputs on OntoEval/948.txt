**Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the ontology provided. The ontology includes the necessary classes and properties to represent doctors, employees, evaluations, and evaluation statements.

Here's the SPARQL query to retrieve the evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  # Specify the doctor and employee URIs
  BIND (<Doctor_URI> AS ?doctor)
  BIND (<Employee_URI> AS ?employee)
  
  # Ensure the doctor is of type Cl_Doctor
  ?doctor rdf:type :Cl_Doctor .

  # The doctor evaluates an evaluation
  ?doctor :evaluates ?evaluation .

  # The evaluation is for the specified employee
  ?evaluation :evaluationFor ?employee .

  # Ensure the employee is of type Cl_Employee
  ?employee rdf:type :Cl_Employee .

  # Retrieve the evaluation statement
  ?evaluation :evaluationStatement ?evaluationStatement .
}
```

Please replace `<Doctor_URI>` and `<Employee_URI>` with the actual URIs of the doctor and employee you're interested in.

This query works by:

- Selecting the evaluation statements (`?evaluationStatement`) associated with evaluations where:
  - A specific doctor (`?doctor`) who is a `:Cl_Doctor` evaluates (`:evaluates`) an evaluation (`?evaluation`).
  - The evaluation is for a specific employee (`?employee`) who is a `:Cl_Employee`.
- The evaluation has an `:evaluationStatement` which contains the desired information.
