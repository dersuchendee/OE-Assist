**No**

Because the ontology lacks a data property to identify a specific festival (e.g., no `:festivalName`), we cannot fully answer the CQ "When did a certain theatre festival take place?" However, we can extract the occurrence dates of all festivals.

```sparql
SELECT ?festival ?occurrenceDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :occurrenceDate ?occurrenceDate .
}
```
