**Yes**

The competency question can be answered using the ontology, as it models the relationships between books or CDs and the articles they contain through the properties `:hasArticle` and `ce:hasMember`. Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the articles composed within each specific book or CD:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX ce: <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/collectionentity.owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?bookOrCD ?bookOrCDLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a ?bookOrCDType .
  FILTER (?bookOrCDType = :Book || ?bookOrCDType = :CD) .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?bookOrCD rdfs:label ?bookOrCDLabel . }
  
  ?bookOrCD ce:hasMember|:hasArticle ?article .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Book` or `:CD`, retrieves their labels, and finds the articles they are composed of using the `ce:hasMember` or `:hasArticle` properties. It also retrieves the labels of the articles, if available.
