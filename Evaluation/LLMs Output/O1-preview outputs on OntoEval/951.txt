This SPARQL query retrieves the articles that a specific book or CD (in this case, `:ArticleCollection_NursePractices`) is composed of, along with their titles. The ontology models the relationship between books/CDs and articles using the `:op_composedOf` object property, making it possible to answer the competency question.
