**Yes**

The CQ is answerable since the ontology models Books and CDs (as `ns1:ArticleCollection`) and uses the `ns1:hasArticle` property to associate them with their constituent articles. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the articles that compose a specific book or CD.

Here's a SPARQL query to retrieve the articles contained in a specific book or CD:

```sparql
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  # Replace the URI below with the specific book or CD you're interested in
  ns1:NursePracticesInCancerPatientCare ns1:hasArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
```

To generalize for any book or CD, you can use the following query:

```sparql
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?collection ?collectionLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?collection rdf:type ?collectionType .
  VALUES ?collectionType { ns1:Book ns1:CD } .
  OPTIONAL { ?collection rdfs:label ?collectionLabel . }

  ?collection ns1:hasArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves all books and CDs along with their associated articles. The `VALUES` clause specifies that we're interested in individuals of type `ns1:Book` or `ns1:CD`. The `ns1:hasArticle` property is used to find the articles contained within each collection.
