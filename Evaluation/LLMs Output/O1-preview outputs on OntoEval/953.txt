**No**

The ontology provides the classes and properties for `ArticleCollection`, `Book`, `CD`, and `Article`, and the relationship `:contains` between them. However, under the Closed World Assumption, since there are no individuals (instances) of specific books, CDs, or articles defined in the ontology, we cannot extract the articles of a specific book or CD. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered with the given ontology.

Here is a SPARQL query that partially answers the question by retrieving any articles contained in any book or CD:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/articlecollection#>

SELECT ?collection ?article
WHERE {
  ?collection a :ArticleCollection .
  ?collection :contains ?article .
}
```

This query retrieves all articles contained in any `ArticleCollection` (which includes `Book` and `CD`), but without specific instances, it cannot provide the articles for a specific book or CD.
