This query retrieves the articles (`?article`) contained in a specific book or CD (`?publication`). It filters for publications that are instances of `:Cl_Book` or `:Cl_CD`, matches the specific publication by its title `"Specific Publication Title"`, and then finds all articles associated with it via the `:containsArticle` property. The titles of the articles are retrieved if available.
