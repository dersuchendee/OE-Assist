Answer: **Yes**

The ontology includes classes and properties that represent books, CDs, articles, and their composition relationships. Specifically, `:Book` and `:CD` are subclasses of `:ArticleCollection`, which in turn is a subclass of `:Collection`. The `:ArticleCollection` class has an object property `:hasMember` that relates it to its member articles (instances of `:Article`). Therefore, we can construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the articles that a specific book or CD is composed of.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>

SELECT ?bookOrCD ?bookOrCDTitle ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a ?collectionType .
  VALUES ?collectionType { :Book :CD } .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?bookOrCD :title ?bookOrCDTitle . }
  
  ?bookOrCD :hasMember ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article :title ?articleTitle . }
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Book` or `:CD` and retrieves the articles they contain via the `:hasMember` property. It also optionally retrieves titles for the books/CDs and articles if such information is available.
