**No**

The competency question "Where did a certain festival take place?" cannot be fully answered using the given ontology because there is no direct connection between a specific festival (`:Cl_Festival`) and its occurrence (`:Cl_FestivalOccurrence`), nor is there a property associating a festival occurrence with its festival name. The ontology lacks a property that links `:Cl_Festival` instances to `:Cl_FestivalOccurrence` instances.

However, we can extract partial information about festival occurrences and the cities where they took place. Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves festival occurrences and their locations:

```sparql
SELECT ?festivalOccurrence ?date ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?festivalOccurrence rdf:type :Cl_FestivalOccurrence .
  ?festivalOccurrence :hasDate ?date .
  ?festivalOccurrence :tookPlaceIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :hasName ?cityName . }
}
```

This query will provide the festival occurrences (`?festivalOccurrence`), the dates they occurred (`?date`), and the cities where they took place (`?cityName`), if the city names are available. Unfortunately, without a link between the festival and its occurrence, we cannot determine "where a certain festival took place" based solely on the festival's name.
