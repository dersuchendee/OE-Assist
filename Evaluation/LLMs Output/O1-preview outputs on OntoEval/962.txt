Answer: **Yes**

You can retrieve the articles that a specific book or CD is composed of using the following SPARQL query. Replace `:SpecificPublication` with the URI of the book or CD you're interested in.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
    :SpecificPublication :composedOf ?article .
    ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
}
```

For example, to find the articles in the book "*Nurse practices in cancer patient care â€“ longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals*", use:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
    :NursePracticesInCancerPatientCare :composedOf ?article .
    ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
}
```

This query will return all articles that are components of the specified book or CD, along with their titles.
