Here is a SPARQL query to find the articles that a specific book or CD is composed of:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?bookOrCD ?bookOrCDLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a ?type .
  FILTER (?type = :Cl_Book || ?type = :Cl_CD) .
  ?bookOrCD :containsArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?bookOrCD rdfs:label ?bookOrCDLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves all books or CDs (`?bookOrCD`) along with their associated articles (`?article`). It uses the `:containsArticle` property to find the articles contained in each book or CD. The `FILTER` ensures that only instances of `:Cl_Book` or `:Cl_CD` are considered. The `OPTIONAL` clauses are used to get labels if they are available.
