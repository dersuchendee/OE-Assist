**No**

Given the ontology, there is no direct relationship between a specific book or CD and the articles it is composed of. The ontology defines that an `:ArticleCollection` contains articles through the `:containsArticle` property, but there is no link between `:Cl_Book` or `:Cl_CD` and `:Cl_ArticleCollection`. Therefore, we cannot write a SPARQL query to answer the competency question as is.

However, we can extract partial information about which articles are contained in article collections:

```sparql
SELECT ?articleCollection ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?articleCollection a :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  ?articleCollection :containsArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
```
