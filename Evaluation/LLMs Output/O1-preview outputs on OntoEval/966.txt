**No**

Despite the ontology including classes like `Cl_Book`, `Cl_ArticleCollection`, and `Cl_Article`, there is no explicit relationship connecting specific books or CDs directly to the articles they are composed of. The property `:containsArticle` connects `Cl_ArticleCollection` to `Cl_Article`, but there is no property linking `Cl_Book` to `Cl_ArticleCollection` or directly to `Cl_Article`.

Here's a SPARQL query that extracts a partial answer by retrieving articles within article collections, but it cannot associate them with specific books or CDs due to the missing relationships:

```sparql
SELECT ?articleCollection ?articleCollectionTitle ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?articleCollection rdf:type :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  OPTIONAL { ?articleCollection :collectionTitle ?articleCollectionTitle . }
  
  ?articleCollection :containsArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle . }
}
```

This query retrieves articles contained in article collections but cannot link them to specific books or CDs.
