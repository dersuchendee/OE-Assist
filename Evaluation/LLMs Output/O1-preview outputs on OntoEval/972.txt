**Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?numPages
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Cl_Book .
  ?book :hasBookDetails ?details .
  ?details :hasNumberOfPages ?numPages .
}
```

The given ontology contains all the necessary information to answer the competency question. We can retrieve the number of pages for a particular book by following the relationships defined:

- **:Cl_Book** represents books in the ontology.
- Each book has a **:hasBookDetails** property linking it to its details.
- The book details have a **:hasNumberOfPages** property that specifies the number of pages.

By querying for instances of **:Cl_Book** and navigating through **:hasBookDetails** to **:hasNumberOfPages**, we can obtain the number of pages for each book present in the ontology.
