```sparql
SELECT ?book ?bookTitle ?numPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?book rdfs:label ?bookTitle . }
  ?book :hasNumberOfPages ?numPages .
}
```

The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the provided ontology because it includes:

- The class `:Book`, representing books.
- The datatype property `:hasNumberOfPages`, which associates a book with its number of pages.

The SPARQL query above selects all books and retrieves their titles (if available) and the number of pages they contain. If you are interested in a specific book, for example, "Nurse Practices in Cancer Patient Care â€“ longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals," you can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
SELECT ?numPages
WHERE {
  :NursePracticesInCancerPatientCare :hasNumberOfPages ?numPages .
}
```

This query directly retrieves the number of pages for the specific book identified by `:NursePracticesInCancerPatientCare`.
