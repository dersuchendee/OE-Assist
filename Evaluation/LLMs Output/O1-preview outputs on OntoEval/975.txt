**Answer: Yes**

The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" is supported by the ontology. The ontology includes the class `ns1:Book` and the datatype property `ns1:hasTotalPages`, which associates books with their total number of pages. Therefore, we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the number of pages for any book in the ontology.

```sparql
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?book ?bookLabel ?totalPages
WHERE {
  ?book a ns1:Book .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?book rdfs:label ?bookLabel . }
  
  ?book ns1:hasTotalPages ?totalPages .
}
```

This query retrieves all books in the ontology, their labels (if available), and their total number of pages.
