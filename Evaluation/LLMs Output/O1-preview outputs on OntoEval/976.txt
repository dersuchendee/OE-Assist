**No**

The ontology provided lacks properties to uniquely identify a particular book (e.g., by title or identifier). Without a way to specify which book we're referring to, we cannot extract the number of pages for a specific book as required by the competency question. However, we can write a partial SPARQL query that retrieves the number of pages for all books defined in the ontology.

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?pageNumber
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book .
  ?book :pageNumber ?pageNumber .
}
```

This query will retrieve all books and their respective page numbers, but it doesn't allow us to focus on a particular book due to the absence of identifiers or distinguishing properties in the ontology.
