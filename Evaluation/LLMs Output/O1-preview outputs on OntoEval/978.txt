**Yes**

The competency question is answerable using the provided ontology, as it includes the class `:Book` and the datatype property `:pageCount` associated with it. Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the page count of a particular book based on its title:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>

SELECT ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book .
  ?book :title "Nurse practices in cancer patient care â€“ longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals" .
  ?book :pageCount ?pageCount .
}
```

This query selects the `?pageCount` of the book with the specified title. The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to answer the competency question under the closed-world assumption.
