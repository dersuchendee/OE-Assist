**Answer: Yes**

The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" can be answered using the given ontology. The ontology includes classes and properties that represent books and their number of pages.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves the number of pages for each book:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?title ?pages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :title ?title .
  ?book :pages ?pages .
}
```

This query selects all instances of `:Cl_Book`, retrieves their titles using the `:title` property, and gets the number of pages using the `:pages` property.
