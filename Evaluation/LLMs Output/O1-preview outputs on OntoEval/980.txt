Answer: **No**.

The ontology lacks a property to identify a specific book (e.g., by its title), so we cannot fully answer the competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" However, we can extract partial information about books and their page counts.

Partial SPARQL query:
```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?book ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
    ?book a :Cl_Book .
    ?book :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages .
}
```
