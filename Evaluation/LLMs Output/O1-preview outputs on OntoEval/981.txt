Answer: **No**

The competency question cannot be fully answered because the ontology lacks a property to identify a particular book (e.g., a 'title' property). Without the ability to specify which book we are referring to, we cannot determine the number of pages of a particular book.

Partial SPARQL query to retrieve the number of pages for all books:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :hasDetails ?bookDetails .
  ?bookDetails :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages .
}
```
