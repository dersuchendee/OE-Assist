Answer: **Yes**

The competency question can be answered because the ontology includes the `:pageCount` property for books, and the page count is specified for the individual book `:Book_Nurse_Practices`.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the number of pages a particular book contains:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?bookTitle ?pageCount
WHERE {
    ?book a :Cl_Book .
    ?book rdfs:label ?bookTitle .
    ?book :pageCount ?pageCount .
}
```

This query retrieves the titles and page counts of all books in the ontology. If you want to find the page count of a specific book, you can modify the query by adding a filter or specifying the book title:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?pageCount
WHERE {
    ?book a :Cl_Book .
    ?book rdfs:label "Nurse practices in cancer patient care â€“ longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals" .
    ?book :pageCount ?pageCount .
}
```

This query will return the page count for the specified book.
