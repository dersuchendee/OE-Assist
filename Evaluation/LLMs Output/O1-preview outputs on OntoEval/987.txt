The competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" is supported by the ontology. We can extract the number of pages of a book from the ontology since it contains the class `Cl_Book` with a data property `numberOfPages`.

Here is a SPARQL query to retrieve the number of pages for each book in the ontology:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?bookTitle ?numPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?book rdfs:label ?bookTitle . }
  ?book :numberOfPages ?numPages .
}
```

If you want to find the number of pages for a specific book, for example, "Nurse practices in cancer patient care – longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals", you can use the following query:

```sparql
SELECT ?numPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book ;
        rdfs:label "Nurse practices in cancer patient care â longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals" ;
        :numberOfPages ?numPages .
}
```
