**No**

The given ontology defines the class `:Cl_Book` and associates the data property `:pageCount` with instances of `:Cl_Book`. However, there is no property to identify a particular book (e.g., no title or identifier). Under the closed world assumption, we cannot specify or retrieve the page count of a specific book since the ontology lacks the means to uniquely identify it.

Here is a SPARQL query that extracts a partial answer by listing all books and their page counts:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :pageCount ?pageCount .
}
```
