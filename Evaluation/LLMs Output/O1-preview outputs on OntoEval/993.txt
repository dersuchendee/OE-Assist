**No**

The ontology does not provide a property to identify a particular book (e.g., by title or identifier), so we cannot specify which book we are querying about. Therefore, we cannot fully answer the CQ "How many pages does a particular book contain?"

Partial SPARQL query to list all books and their page counts:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :hasPageCount ?pageCount .
}
```
