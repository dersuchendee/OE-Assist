Answer: **No**

The ontology does not include properties to identify a particular book, such as a title or unique identifier. Therefore, we cannot specify a particular book in our query to find out how many pages it contains. However, we can retrieve the number of pages for all books present in the ontology.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?book ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Cl_Book .
  ?book :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages .
}
```
