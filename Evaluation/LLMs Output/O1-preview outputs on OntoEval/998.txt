Answer: **Yes**.

The competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" can be answered using the provided ontology. Both `ns1:Book` and `ns1:CD` are subclasses of `ns1:Publication`, and instances of these classes have the `ns1:hasPublicationDate` property, which contains the publication date.

Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves books or CDs and their publication dates:

```sparql
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?publication ?pubLabel ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?publication a ?pubType .
  VALUES ?pubType { ns1:Book ns1:CD }
  OPTIONAL { ?publication rdfs:label ?pubLabel . }
  ?publication ns1:hasPublicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```

This query selects all instances of `ns1:Book` or `ns1:CD`, retrieves their labels (if available), and their publication dates.
