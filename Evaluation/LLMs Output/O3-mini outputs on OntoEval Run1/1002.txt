**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves publication instances with their publication dates for publications that are either books or CDs:

———————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?publication ?publicationTitle ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?pubInst a :Cl_PublicationInstance ;
           :hasPublication ?publication ;
           :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
  ?publication :publicationTitle ?publicationTitle .
  ?publication a ?pubType .
  FILTER(?pubType = :Cl_Book || ?pubType = :Cl_CD)
}
ORDER BY ?publicationDate
———————————————————————————————

In this query we assume that a “publication instance” (of type Cl_PublicationInstance) is linked via the object property :hasPublication to a publication (either a Book or a CD) whose title is given by the data property :publicationTitle, and the publication date is recorded by :publicationDate. This design (using the pivot class Cl_PublicationInstance) means that the competency question “When was a certain book or CD published?” is fully answerable by the ontology under a closed world assumption.
