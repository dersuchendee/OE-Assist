**Yes**

Assuming we know which book or CD we wish to inspect (or else retrieving all such publications), a SPARQL query that answers “when was a certain book or CD published?” might be written as follows:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
SELECT ?publication ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?publication a ?type .
  FILTER(?type IN (:Cl_Book, :Cl_CD)) .
  ?publication :published ?pubObj .
  ?pubObj :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
ORDER BY ?publication

This query uses the ontology’s model for publications by retrieving instances of :Cl_Book or :Cl_CD, following the published relation to a publication object and then extracting its publicationDate.
