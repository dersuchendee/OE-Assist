**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closedâ€‘world assumption, retrieves the publication date of resources that are either a book or a CD (using the classes :Cl_Book and :Cl_CD) along with their titles:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?publication ?title ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  { ?publication a :Cl_Book }
  UNION
  { ?publication a :Cl_CD } .
  ?publication :publicationTitle ?title .
  ?publication :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
ORDER BY ?publication

This query answers the competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" by extracting the publication date (and title) of all individuals that are instances of either :Cl_Book or :Cl_CD.
