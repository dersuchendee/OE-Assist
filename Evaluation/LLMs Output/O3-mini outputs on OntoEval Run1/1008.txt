**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the publication date for books and CDs from the ontology:

-----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?publication ?title ?pubDate
WHERE {
  { ?publication a :Cl_Book ;
                  :publicationDate ?pubDate .
    OPTIONAL { ?publication :publicationTitle ?title . }
  }
  UNION
  { ?publication a :Cl_CD ;
                  :publicationDate ?pubDate .
    OPTIONAL { ?publication :publicationTitle ?title . }
  }
}
-----------------------------------

By retrieving the publication date for any individual that is modeled as a book or CD, this query answers the competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" under the closed world assumption.
