**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, extracts the city where a given theatre festival (for example "Roma Loves Shakespeare") took place by linking a festival’s occurrence (via :festivalHasOccurrence) to a city (via :cityHasOccurrence):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            rdfs:label "Roma Loves Shakespeare" ;
            :festivalHasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?city a :Cl_City ;
         :cityHasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel. }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology connects a theatre festival to its occurrence and further to a geographical location (a city), so the CQ “Where did a certain festival take place?” is indeed answerable.
