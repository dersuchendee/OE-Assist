**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that returns the publication date for instances of books or CDs (here represented as members of the class Cl_ArticleCollection):

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?bookOrCD ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  ?bookOrCD :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology explicitly provides a publication date for article collections (which are modelled as books and CDs). Under the closed-world assumption, all relevant publication dates are expected to be asserted in the ontology.
