**Yes**

Assuming the ontology uses closed‚Äêworld reasoning and that all instances of a book or CD will have an associated publication date via the :publicationDate property, you can fully answer the CQ. For example, you can extract the publication date of all instances of :Cl_Book and :Cl_CD with the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?item ?pubDate
WHERE {
  { ?item a :Cl_Book } UNION { ?item a :Cl_CD } .
  ?item :publicationDate ?pubDate .
}
ORDER BY ?pubDate

This query returns each book or CD (?item) along with its publication date (?pubDate).
