**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the seminar and its held date:

-----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?heldOnDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :heldOnDate ?heldOnDate .
}
-----------------------------------

Explanation:
The ontology models seminars as instances of the class :Cl_Seminar with the data property :heldOnDate. Therefore, the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" is fully answerable using the information provided by the ontology.
