**Yes**

We can answer the CQ since the ontology explicitly represents seminars and associates them with dates via the property :hasDate. Under the closed‐world assumption, only those seminars that are known to have a date (and thus satisfy the restriction) would be returned. For example, you can extract when a seminar took place using this query:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/seminar#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasDate ?date .
}
ORDER BY ?date

This query retrieves all seminars and their associated dates, thus answering “When did a certain seminar take place?”
