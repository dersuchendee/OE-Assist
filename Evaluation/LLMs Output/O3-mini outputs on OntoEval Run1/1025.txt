**Yes**

Assuming a seminar is represented as an instance of :Cl_Seminar with an associated start date via the :startDate property, you can extract the date of a given seminar. For example, if the “certain seminar” is identified (e.g. by its URI or by a label), the following query returns its start date:

-------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :startDate ?startDate .
  # Uncomment and adjust the following line if you need to filter for a specific seminar
  # FILTER(?seminar = :YourSeminarIdentifier)
}
-------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question by directly linking a seminar instance with its date under a closed‐world assumption.
