**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the date(s) associated with seminar instances (using the class :Cl_Seminar and its property :seminarDate):

----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
----------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology provides the necessary classes and properties (namely, the seminar class and its corresponding date property) so that “When did a certain seminar take place?” can be answered from the knowledge base.
