**Yes**

Below is a sample SPARQL query that retrieves seminar instances along with their scheduled dates, which answers the CQ “When did a certain seminar take place?” by extracting the seminar’s date (using the seminarDate property defined for :Cl_Seminar):

-------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
-------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption the query returns only those seminars with an explicitly stated date, fully supporting the competency question.
