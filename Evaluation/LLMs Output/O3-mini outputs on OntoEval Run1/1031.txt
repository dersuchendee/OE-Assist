**Yes**

We can extract the seminar’s date from the ontology. For instance, the ontology defines a class Cl_Seminar and a data property seminarDate. A SPARQL query to answer “When did a certain seminar take place?” could be:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate 
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
---------------------------------

This query retrieves all seminars (e.g., :SeminarOnNursePractices) along with their associated seminar dates (e.g., "2008-12-01"^^xsd:date), showing that the CQ is indeed modelled in the ontology under the closed world assumption.
