**Yes**

We can answer this competency question using the ontology. In the ontology there is a class for seminars (Cl_Seminar) that is connected with the data property :seminarDate. For example, one seminar is represented as an individual (:Seminar_2008) with a :seminarDate.

A SPARQL query answering “When did a certain seminar take place?” is for instance:

--------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?label
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           rdfs:label ?label ;
           :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
  # Optional filter to target a specific seminar if needed
  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?label), "nurse practices"))
}
--------------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the seminar individual(s), its label, and the date it took place.
