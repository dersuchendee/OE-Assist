**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves seminars and the dates on which they took place:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
ORDER BY ?seminarDate
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology provides a class for seminars (Cl_Seminar) and a data property (:seminarDate) that connects seminars with the date they took place, thus fully supporting the competency question.
