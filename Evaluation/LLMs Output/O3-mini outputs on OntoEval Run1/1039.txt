SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
```

This query retrieves all seminars and their dates (assuming that seminar instances in the ontology have the data property :seminarDate), which answers the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" under the closed world assumption.
