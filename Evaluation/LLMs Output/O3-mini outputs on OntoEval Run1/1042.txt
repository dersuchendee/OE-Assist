SELECT ?seminar ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE { 
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentedArticle ?article .
  ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
  
  # Uncomment the next line to restrict to a particular seminar:
  # FILTER(?seminar = :Seminar_Dec2008)
}
ORDER BY ?seminar ?articleTitle

This query demonstrates that the ontology models the competency question since we can extract the articles presented at a seminar using the provided properties (:hasPresentedArticle and :presentedAt).
