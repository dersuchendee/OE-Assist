**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world interpretation of the ontology, retrieves the articles (and their titles) that have been presented in a given seminar – for example, by filtering on a seminar individual such as :Ind_Seminar2008:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?article ?title ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article ;
           :dp_title ?title ;
           :op_presentedIn ?presentation .
           
  ?presentation a :Cl_SeminarPresentation ;
                :op_presents ?seminar .
                
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :dp_date ?date .
           
  # Specify the particular seminar (adjust as needed)
  FILTER(?seminar = :Ind_Seminar2008)
}
ORDER BY ?article

In this query the link from the article (:Cl_Article) to the presentation event (:Cl_SeminarPresentation) and then to the seminar (:Cl_Seminar) allows us to extract exactly the data asked by the CQ.
