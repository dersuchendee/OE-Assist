Assuming that a “certain seminar” is identified (for example, by its title), the following SPARQL query makes use of the relations defined in the ontology (the :SeminarArticle class and the :presentedIn & :hasArticleTitle properties) to extract all articles presented in that seminar. Under the closed‐world assumption, any article not connected as specified is considered not presented in that seminar.

For example, if the seminar is identified by its title "December 2008 Seminar", the query is:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/seminararticles#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?article a :SeminarArticle .
  ?article :presentedIn ?seminar .
  ?seminar a :Seminar ;
           :hasSeminarTitle "December 2008 Seminar" .
  OPTIONAL { ?article :hasArticleTitle ?articleTitle . }
}

This query returns all articles (and optionally their titles) that were presented in the seminar titled "December 2008 Seminar".
