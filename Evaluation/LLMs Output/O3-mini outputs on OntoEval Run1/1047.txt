**Yes**

Assuming that the seminar of interest is identified by its IRI (or that we are interested in all seminars), here is a SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the articles presented in each seminar along with any available titles:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarTitle ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentedArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarTitle . }
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleTitle . }
}
------------------------------------------------

This query models the competency question by directly retrieving the articles (via the :hasPresentedArticle property) that were presented during a seminar, fulfilling the information requested by the CQ.
