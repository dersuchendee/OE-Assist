**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the city (location) where a given theatre festival took place. In this example the query returns all festivals along with their heldIn city. (If you want to filter on a “certain festival” by its label or URI you can add an appropriate FILTER clause.)

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  ?festival :heldIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}

This query extracts the instances of Cl_TheatreFestival along with the associated city (via the property heldIn), demonstrating that the CQ “Where did a certain festival take place?” is answerable using the ontology.
