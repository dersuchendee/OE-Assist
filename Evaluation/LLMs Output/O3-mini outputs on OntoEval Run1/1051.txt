We can answer the competency question “What articles were presented in a certain seminar?” because the ontology includes a reification of the presentation event. In particular, an article (of type Cl_Article) is connected via the object property presentedAt to a reified presentation (of type Cl_SeminarPresentation) that in turn is constrained to be related to a seminar (of type Cl_Seminar). Under a closed‐world assumption, we can assume that if a seminar is not linked by the property (using the given pattern) to a presentation, then no article was presented there.

A corresponding SPARQL query is shown below. (Replace <http://www.example.org/test#SomeSeminar> with the URI of the particular seminar of interest.)

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?article ?articleLabel ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
  ?article :presentedAt ?presentation .
  ?presentation :presentedAt ?seminar .
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate . }
  
  FILTER(?seminar = <http://www.example.org/test#SomeSeminar>)
}
ORDER BY ?article

This query extracts all articles associated (via a reified presentation) with the designated seminar, which shows that the CQ is supported by the ontology.
