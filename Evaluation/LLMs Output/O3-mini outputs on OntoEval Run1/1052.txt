Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves all articles (instances of Cl_Article) which were presented in a given seminar (here, for instance, the seminar with identifier :SeminarOnNursePractices):

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
SELECT ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article ;
           :articleTitle ?articleTitle ;
           :presentedIn ?presentation .
  ?presentation :presentationOf :SeminarOnNursePractices .
}
------------------------------------------------------------

In this query the pathway from an article, through its associated seminar presentation (via the property :presentedIn), to the seminar (via :presentationOf) is used to extract articles that were presented in that seminar.
