Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the articles (and optionally their titles) presented in a given seminar. In this example the seminar is identified by its individual (e.g. :SeminarOnNursePractices):

------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?article ?articleTitle ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
  ?article :presentedIn ?presentation .
  ?presentation :presentationOf ?seminar .
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle . }
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate . }
  
  FILTER(?seminar = :SeminarOnNursePractices)
}
ORDER BY ?seminarDate
------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology provides sufficient connections—in particular through the properties :presentedIn and :presentationOf—to answer the competency question "What articles were presented in a certain seminar?" under a closed world assumption.
