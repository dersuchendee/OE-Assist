**Yes**

Assuming that the individual for the seminar is already identified (for example, as :SeminarInDecember2008), the following SPARQL query extracts the articles (and their titles) that were presented in that seminar:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?presentation a :Cl_SeminarPresentation ;
                :presentedIn :SeminarInDecember2008 ;
                :presentationOf ?article .
  ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query works under the closed-world assumption by explicitly using the known individual (:SeminarInDecember2008) and the reified structure that connects seminar presentations to articles via the properties :presentedIn and :presentationOf.
