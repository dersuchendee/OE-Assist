Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the articles (represented as seminar presentations which are also articles) that were included in a given seminar. (You can filter by a specific seminarâ€”for example by its date or by a known identifier.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarDate ?seminarDate ;
           :seminarIncludesPresentation ?presentation .
  ?presentation a :Cl_Article .
  OPTIONAL { ?presentation rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
  BIND(?presentation AS ?article) .
  
  # Optionally, filter for a particular seminar.
  # For example, if you want the seminar held in December 2008:
  # FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?seminarDate), "2008-12"))
}
ORDER BY ?seminar ?seminarDate ?article

In this query the property :seminarIncludesPresentation links a seminar to its presentations, and because the presentation class is defined as a subclass of both Cl_Seminar and Cl_Article, we are able to extract the articles presented in the seminar.
