**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the articles presented during a given seminar. (Replace <seminarURI> with the URI of the seminar you wish to inspect.)

---------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  # Identify the specified seminar
  <seminarURI> a :Cl_Seminar .
  
  # From the seminar, follow the relation to its seminar article presentation instance.
  <seminarURI> :containsPresentationOf ?presentation .
  
  # Ensure that the presentation is defined as a seminar article presentation (i.e. reified article presentation)
  ?presentation a :Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation .
  
  # Since the reification class indicates that the presentation instance embodies the article,
  # we treat ?presentation as the article.
  BIND(?presentation AS ?article)
  
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

In this ontology, the CQ “What articles were presented in a certain seminar?” is answerable because the reification class Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation connects the seminar (via :containsPresentationOf and :presentedIn) with the article content.
