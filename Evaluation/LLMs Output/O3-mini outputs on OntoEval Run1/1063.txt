SELECT ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  # Specify the seminar of interest. Replace :SeminarXYZ with the desired seminar IRI.
  :SeminarXYZ a :Cl_Seminar .

  # Find articles that are connected via the property :presentedIn.
  ?article a :Cl_Article ;
           :presentedIn :SeminarXYZ .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
----------------------------------------------------

In this query the competency question "What articles were presented in a certain seminar?" is answerable by the ontology since the classes and object property (presentedIn) allow one to directly link a seminar (an instance of :Cl_Seminar) with the articles (instances of :Cl_Article) that were presented during that seminar.
