**Yes**
Below is one example SPARQL query that retrieves the location at which a chosen seminar took place. In this query we assume that a seminar is connected to a seminar event using the property P_isOccurrenceOf and that the event is linked to a location using the property P_occursAt.

------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?seminar ?location
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminarEvent :P_isOccurrenceOf ?seminar .
  ?seminarEvent :P_occursAt ?location .
}
------------------------------------------------------

This query returns, for each seminar, the corresponding location where its seminar event occurred, thereby answering the CQ under the closed world assumption.
