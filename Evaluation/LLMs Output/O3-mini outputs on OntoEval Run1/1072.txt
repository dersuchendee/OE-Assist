**Yes**

Assuming the ontology represents seminars with the class Cl_Seminar and the location of a seminar is indicated through a two‐step relation—first via the property tookPlaceAt linking the seminar to an instance of Cl_SeminarLocation, and then via the property seminarLocation linking that instance to a Cl_Location—you can extract the seminar’s location with a query such as:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLocation ?location
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :tookPlaceAt ?seminarLocation .
  ?seminarLocation :seminarLocation ?location .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves each seminar, its associated seminar location instance, and the linked location (e.g., a hospital or other place) where the seminar took place, thus fully answering the competency question under a closed world assumption.
