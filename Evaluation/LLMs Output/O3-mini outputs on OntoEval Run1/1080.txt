**Yes**

We can extract the answer using a query that retrieves seminars (of type Cl_Seminar) and their associated locations (via the seminarLocation property). For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?hospital ?hospitalLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarLocation ?hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?seminarDate

This query answers “Where did a certain seminar take place?” by retrieving the hospital where the seminar was held. The result set should include the seminar’s identifier, its date (if available), and the hospital (and its label) where it took place.
