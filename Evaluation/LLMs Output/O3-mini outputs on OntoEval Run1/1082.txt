**Yes**

Assuming the closed‐world interpretation, the ontology explicitly models seminars via the class Cl_Seminar and their locations via the object property seminarTookPlaceAt (with range Cl_Location). This allows us to directly write a SPARQL query to retrieve “where” a particular seminar took place. For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?seminar ?location
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarTookPlaceAt ?location .
}

This query retrieves all seminars (instances of Cl_Seminar) along with their corresponding locations, which answers the competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" under the closed world assumption.
