**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the seminar along with the hospital (its location) at which it was held, based on the property :seminarHeldAt in the ontology:

---------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?hospital ?hospitalLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
  ?seminar :seminarHeldAt ?hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
}
---------------------------------------------------------

In this closed‐world interpretation we assume that only seminars explicitly having a :seminarHeldAt property are considered to have a location, hence the query “Where did a certain seminar take place?” is fully answerable from the ontology.
