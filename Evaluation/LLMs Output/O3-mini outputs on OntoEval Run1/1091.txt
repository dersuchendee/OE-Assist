**Yes**

The ontology asserts that every Seminar (i.e., every instance of :Seminar) has at least one associated article via the restriction:

  :Seminar rdfs:subClassOf [ a owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :presents ; owl:minCardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] .

Thus, under the closed world assumption the competency question “At least one article is always presented at each seminar” is answerable via a query that retrieves each seminar together with the article(s) it presents. One such SPARQL query is:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/seminararticles#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :presents ?article .
}
ORDER BY ?seminar

This query lists all seminars along with at least one article they present.
