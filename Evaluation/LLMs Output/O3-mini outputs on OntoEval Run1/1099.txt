**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that returns each seminar alongside at least one article presented at that seminar under a closed‚Äêworld interpretation:

SELECT DISTINCT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarDate ?seminarDate ;
           :presentationOf ?semPres .
  
  ?article a :Cl_Article ;
           :articleTitle ?articleTitle ;
           :presentedIn ?semPres .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query extracts all seminars that have at least one associated seminar presentation that in turn is linked to an article. Under the closed-world assumption all seminars in the data are expected to have at least one article presented, hence the CQ is answerable from the ontology.
