**Yes**

We can check that every seminar in the ontology is required (by its subclass restriction) to have at least one presented article. Under the closed world assumption, we assume that if a seminar instance is present then it must have one or more articles connected via the property :hasPresentedArticle. The following SPARQL query retrieves each seminar with its presented articles:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?presentedArticle
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentedArticle ?presentedArticle .
}

If every seminar has at least one presented article, each result will include a seminar and one (or more) associated article.
