**Yes**

Under the closed-world assumption, every seminar must have at least one associated article. We can query for seminars along with at least one article presented in them. For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar rdf:type :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasArticle ?article .
}

This query returns every seminar that has at least one article, verifying that the ontology models the competency question.
