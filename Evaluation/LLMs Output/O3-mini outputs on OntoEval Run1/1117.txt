**No**

Since the ontology does not explicitly indicate which activity is immediately “previous” (there’s a property :previousActivity but no instance triples use it to order the user’s activities), the competency question “What did the user do previously?” cannot be fully answered. However, we can extract a partial answer by retrieving all activities performed by the user.

For example:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?activity ?activityLabel
WHERE {
  ?activity a :Activity ;
            :performedBy :User .
  OPTIONAL { ?activity rdfs:label ?activityLabel. }
}

This query returns the activities performed by the user, which is a partial answer to the CQ under a closed world assumption.
