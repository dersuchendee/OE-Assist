**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves the preferred system action of a user given a particular context (in this case, filtering for the Berlin location and a morning time):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?user ?systemAction ?location ?time
WHERE {
  ?user a :Cl_User ;
        :op_prefers ?userPreferredAction .
  
  ?userPreferredAction :op_hasPreferredAction ?systemAction ;
                       :op_inContext ?context .
                       
  ?context :dp_hasLocation ?location ;
           :dp_hasTime ?time .

  FILTER(STR(?location) = "Berlin")
  FILTER(
    xsd:time(?time) >= xsd:time("06:00:00") &&
    xsd:time(?time) < xsd:time("12:00:00")
  )
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query:
• We start by finding a user (:Cl_User) who has an associated preferred action via the property :op_prefers.
• We then navigate from that reified preference (:Cl_UserPreferredAction) to the preferred system action (:Cl_SystemAction) via :op_hasPreferredAction.
• We also retrieve the context (:Cl_Context) via :op_inContext and its associated location and time data properties.
• Finally, we filter the context to select those with a location "Berlin" and a time corresponding to a morning period. 

This demonstrates that the ontology supports the competency question fully.
