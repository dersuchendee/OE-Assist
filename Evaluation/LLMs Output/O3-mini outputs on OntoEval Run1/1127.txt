Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the weather service providing personalized weather information (that is, a weather service that has been configured with a user preference). In this ontology, a WeatherService individual with a user preference (via the property :hasUserPreference) represents one that tailors its forecasts. The query also optionally retrieves its associated forecast and location:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology/weather#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?service ?serviceLabel ?forecast ?forecastLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?service a :WeatherService ;
           rdfs:label ?serviceLabel ;
           :hasUserPreference ?pref .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?service :hasForecast ?forecast .
    OPTIONAL { ?forecast rdfs:label ?forecastLabel. }
  }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?service :providesForecastFor ?location .
    OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel. }
  }
}
------------------------------------------------

This query answers the CQ by extracting the weather service that is configured with a user preference (i.e. personalized weather information).
