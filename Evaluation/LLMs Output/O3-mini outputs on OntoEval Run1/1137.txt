**Yes**

Assuming individuals of smart devices exist in our data (even if only implied by the ontology’s restrictions) and applying a closed‐world view, we can answer the competency question. In our ontology the intended answer is that weather content can be displayed by a Smart Mirror (which displays weather via its DisplayFunctionality) or read aloud by a Smart Speaker (which announces weather via its AudioFunctionality).

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each smart bathroom device of interest, the device along with the specific weather‐related functionality it provides:

SELECT ?device ?deviceLabel ?functionality ?funcLabel
WHERE {
  {
    ?device a :SmartMirror ;
            :displaysWeather ?functionality .
    OPTIONAL { ?device rdfs:label ?deviceLabel . }
    OPTIONAL { ?functionality rdfs:label ?funcLabel . }
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?device a :SmartSpeaker ;
            :announcesWeather ?functionality .
    OPTIONAL { ?device rdfs:label ?deviceLabel . }
    OPTIONAL { ?functionality rdfs:label ?funcLabel . }
  }
}
---------------------------------------------------------

This query selects devices that are either Smart Mirrors (displaying weather) or Smart Speakers (announcing weather), and returns each device along with the functionality (and any available labels).
