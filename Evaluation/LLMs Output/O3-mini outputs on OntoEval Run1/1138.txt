**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves, for each recorded user interaction, the userâ€™s context (i.e. whether they were standing or walking), the weather instance presented, and the associated presentation outputs (graphics and/or audio). This query assumes that when the user is recorded as standing the weather is provided via graphics (through the :hasOutput property) and when the user is recorded as walking it is provided via audio (through the :hasAudioOutput property):

SELECT ?user ?interaction ?isStanding ?isWalking ?weather ?graphic ?loudspeaker
WHERE {
  ?interaction a :Cl_UserLocationInteraction ;
               :interactsWith ?user ;
               :interactionOutput ?weather ;
               :isStanding ?isStanding ;
               :isWalking ?isWalking .
  OPTIONAL { ?weather :hasOutput ?graphic . }
  OPTIONAL { ?weather :hasAudioOutput ?loudspeaker . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

In a closed world view, if an interaction has isStanding true, then the presentation should use the graphic output from ?graphic; if isWalking is true, then it should use the audio output from ?loudspeaker. This query shows that the ontology has the requisite classes and properties to answer the competency question.
