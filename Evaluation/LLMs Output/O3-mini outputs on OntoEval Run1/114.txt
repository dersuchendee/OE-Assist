**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that returns the location (e.g. city name) for a festival—assuming that the festival’s location information is captured via the reified class Cl_FestivalLocation (a subclass of both Cl_TheatreFestival and Cl_City) and that the location’s name is recorded with the data property locationName. In this example we filter by a festival label (e.g. “Roma Loves Shakespeare”) to “pick” the certain festival mentioned in the story:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?label ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_FestivalLocation .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?label . }
  ?festival :locationName ?locationName .
  FILTER(regex(lcase(str(?label)), "roma loves shakespeare"))
}
---------------------------------

Under a closed‐world view (i.e. with the assumption that only those individuals and assertions explicitly provided hold), this query fully answers the competency question “Where did a certain festival take place?” by retrieving the festival instance(s) (and its label) together with its associated location name.
