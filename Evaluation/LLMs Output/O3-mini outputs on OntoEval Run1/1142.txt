**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the userâ€™s preferences, including the activity they prefer when it is raining (i.e. going to the movies) and the movie genre (i.e. action movies):

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?user ?activity ?weather ?genre
WHERE {
  ?user a :Cl_User ;
        :prefers ?pref .
  ?pref :hasActivity ?activity ;
        :hasWeatherCondition ?weather ;
        :hasPreferredGenre ?genre .

  ?weather :isRaining true .
  ?genre :isActionMovie true .
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query is answerable under the closed world assumption, since the ontology explicitly connects a user with their reified preferences (weather condition, activity, and genre).
