**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the bookings from a user’s calendar that occur within a specified time period. (In this query, the time interval is provided as two dateTime parameters – adjust these values as needed.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?user ?calendar ?booking ?startTime ?endTime
WHERE {
  # Find the user’s calendar
  ?user a :Cl_User .
  ?user :hasCalendar ?calendar .
  
  # Retrieve the reified booking information
  ?calendar :hasBooking ?calendarBooking .
  ?calendarBooking :refersToBooking ?booking .
  ?calendarBooking :bookingDuring ?timePeriod .
  
  # Get booking start/end times
  ?booking :startTime ?startTime .
  ?booking :endTime ?endTime .
  
  # Apply filter for the desired time period (adjust the interval as needed)
  FILTER (
    ?startTime >= "2023-10-10T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime &&
    ?endTime   <= "2023-10-10T12:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime
  )
}
ORDER BY ?startTime

This query is able to answer the competency question “What bookings does the user’s calendar contain during a certain time period?” by exploiting the reification (pivot) class :Cl_CalendarBooking that connects the calendar with its bookings and their associated time period.
