**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the events (i.e. bookings) from the user's calendar which occur during a given time period. (In the query, replace the start and end datetime literals with your desired time boundaries.)

SELECT ?event ?startTime ?endTime
WHERE {
  :myCalendar :containsEvent ?event .
  ?event :hasTimePeriod ?tp .
  ?tp :startTime ?startTime ;
      :endTime ?endTime .
  
  # Filter events that occur within the specified time period.
  # Here, the condition checks for events whose time period overlaps with the queried interval.
  FILTER (
    ?startTime < "2023-04-01T23:59:59Z"^^xsd:dateTime &&
    ?endTime > "2023-04-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime
  )
}

This query answers the competency question by extracting the bookings (events) from the user's calendar that fall within (or overlap with) the specified time period.
