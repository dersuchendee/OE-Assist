Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves for each theatre festival its location (i.e. the city where it took place):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?locationCity
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :locatedIn ?location .
  ?location :locationCity ?locationCity .
}
ORDER BY ?festival
