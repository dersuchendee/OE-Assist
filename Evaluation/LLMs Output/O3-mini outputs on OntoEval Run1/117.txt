**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology version including the data property “hasLocation” for instances of Cl_TheatreFestival is used, you can answer the CQ by extracting the location of a festival. For example, given that the festival individuals are typed as :Cl_TheatreFestival and their locations are recorded using the :hasLocation property, a query to retrieve the location of a specific festival (or all festivals) is as follows:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasLocation ?location .
  # Optionally, filter by a known festival identifier, for example:
  # FILTER(?festival = :RomaLovesShakespeare)
}
------------------------------------------------

This query satisfies the competency question “Where did a certain festival take place?” under the closed world assumption by returning only the festivals for which a location is explicitly provided.
