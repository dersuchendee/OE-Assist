**Yes**

We can retrieve, for each Place, its Sound (which – by the ontology’s modelling – is currently performed since every Sound instance must have isCurrentlyPerformed set to true) and then check which MeansOfPerformance (ManualPerformance or ElectricPerformance) is associated. Here is a possible SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?place ?placeLabel ?sound ?performance ?performanceLabel
WHERE {
  ?place a :Place .
  OPTIONAL { ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel . }
  
  ?place :hasSound ?sound .
  ?sound :isCurrentlyPerformed true .
  
  ?sound :hasMeans ?performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
}
