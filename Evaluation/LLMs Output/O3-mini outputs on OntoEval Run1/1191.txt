**Yes**
```sparql
SELECT ?event (IF(BOUND(?religious), "Religious", "Secular") AS ?eventType)
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  {
    ?event a :ReligiousEvent .
    BIND(true AS ?religious)
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?event a :SecularEvent .
  }
}
```

Under the closed world assumption we assume that every event explicitly classified in the data is either a :ReligiousEvent or a :SecularEvent. This query retrieves every event instance and labels it "Religious" if it is explicitly typed as a :ReligiousEvent; otherwise, if it is not in that branch, we assume it belongs to :SecularEvent.
