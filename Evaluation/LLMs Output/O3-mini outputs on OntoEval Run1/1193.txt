**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves each event’s attendees along with their provenance and (optionally) the reason associated with their attendance – which together answer “What is the provenance of the event attendees? What and how they happened to be there?” under the closed world assumption:

---------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?event ?eventLabel ?person ?personLabel ?provenance ?provenanceLabel ?reason ?reasonLabel
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  OPTIONAL { ?event rdfs:label ?eventLabel . }
  
  ?event :hasAttendance ?attendance .
  ?attendance :attendedBy ?person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  
  ?person :hasProvenance ?provenance .
  OPTIONAL { ?provenance rdfs:label ?provenanceLabel . }
  
  OPTIONAL {
    ?attendance :hasReason ?reason .
    OPTIONAL { ?reason rdfs:label ?reasonLabel . }
  }
}
ORDER BY ?event ?person
---------------------------

This query extracts a complete answer as all the relevant classes and properties (Event, Attendance, Person, Provenance, and Reason) are present in the ontology, thereby modeling the competency question.
