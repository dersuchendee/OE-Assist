**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves persons who participated in a travel along with the destination place they reached. This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question "Did they travel to reach the place?" under a closed world assumption.

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personLabel ?travel ?travelLabel ?destination ?destinationLabel
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  
  ?person :participatedInTravel ?travel .
  OPTIONAL { ?travel rdfs:label ?travelLabel . }
  
  ?travel :hasDestination ?destination .
  OPTIONAL { ?destination rdfs:label ?destinationLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?person

This query demonstrates that the ontology captures the relationship between a Person, the Travel they participated in, and the Place that is the destinationâ€”thus fully modelling the competency question.
