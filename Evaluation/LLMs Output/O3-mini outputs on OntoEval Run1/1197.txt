**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves any instances of power relations between persons by checking for direct assertions of properties (hasPowerOver, patronOf, or supervises):

---------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?subject ?subjectLabel ?relation ?object ?objectLabel
WHERE {
  {
    ?subject :hasPowerOver ?object .
    BIND("hasPowerOver" AS ?relation)
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?subject :patronOf ?object .
    BIND("patronOf" AS ?relation)
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?subject :supervises ?object .
    BIND("supervises" AS ?relation)
  }
  OPTIONAL { ?subject rdfs:label ?subjectLabel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?object rdfs:label ?objectLabel. }
}
---------------------------------------------------------

This query returns any persons (?subject and ?object) connected by a direct power relation as defined in the ontology.
