**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given aquifer environment, the aquifer microbes along with their occurrence abundance. (Replace ":SpecificAquiferEnvironment" with the desired aquifer environment IRI.)

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?microbe ?microbeLabel ?abundance
WHERE {
  ?occurrence a :MicrobeOccurrence .
  ?occurrence :inEnvironment ?environment .
  ?occurrence :hasMicrobe ?microbe .
  OPTIONAL { ?microbe rdfs:label ?microbeLabel . }
  ?occurrence :hasAbundance ?abundance .
  FILTER(?environment = :SpecificAquiferEnvironment)
}
ORDER BY DESC(?abundance)
---------------------------------

This query answers the CQ by extracting the aquifer microbes recorded in a specific aquifer environment and ordering them by the abundance value, thereby allowing the practitioner to identify the most common ones.
