Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves, for any given theatre festival, the plays offered (by following the productionâ€“play links):

PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a theatre:TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  ?festival theatre:hasProduction ?production .
  ?production theatre:hasPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
} 

ORDER BY ?festival ?play

Under the closed world assumption this query extracts the plays scheduled as part of each theatre festival from the given ontology.
