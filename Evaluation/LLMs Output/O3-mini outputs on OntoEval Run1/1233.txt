**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that “extracts” the modelling of the CQ from the ontology by looking up how the BeechForest class is defined to have a process (i.e. Carbon Sequestration) that in turn contributes to the Carbon Cycle:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?beechForest ?process ?cycle
WHERE {
  # We restrict the query to the BeechForest class
  BIND(:BeechForest AS ?beechForest) .
  
  # Extract the restriction stating that BeechForest has a process
  ?beechForest rdfs:subClassOf ?hasProcessRestriction .
  ?hasProcessRestriction owl:onProperty :hasProcess ;
                       owl:someValuesFrom ?process .
  
  # Make sure the process is Carbon Sequestration
  FILTER(?process = :CarbonSequestration) .
  
  # Then, from Carbon Sequestration, extract how it contributes to a cycle
  ?process rdfs:subClassOf ?contribRestriction .
  ?contribRestriction owl:onProperty :contributesTo ;
                      owl:someValuesFrom ?cycle .
                      
  # Ensure that the cycle is the Carbon Cycle 
  FILTER(?cycle = :CarbonCycle) .
}
-------------------------------------------------

Under the closed-world assumption, this query shows that the competency question “How does carbon sequestration in beech forests contribute to overall carbon cycling?” is indeed modelled by the ontology.
