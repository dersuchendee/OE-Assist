SELECT ?process ?fromCompartment ?toCompartment
WHERE {
  ?process a :DissolvedCarbonTransportProcess .
  ?process :fromCompartment ?fromCompartment .
  ?process :toCompartment ?toCompartment .
}
```

In this query we retrieve transport processes (of type DissolvedCarbonTransportProcess) along with their source and destination compartments, which answers how dissolved carbon is transported between environmental compartments.
