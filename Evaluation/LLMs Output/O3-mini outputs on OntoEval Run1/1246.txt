**Yes**

Assuming that instances of water‐quality parameters are available (or can be inferred from the class definition), the following SPARQL query extracts all individuals that are explicitly typed as WaterQualityParameter:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?parameter ?label
WHERE {
  ?parameter a :WaterQualityParameter .
  OPTIONAL { ?parameter rdfs:label ?label . }
}

Under the closed world assumption, only those individuals explicitly stated as a WaterQualityParameter are returned, which answers the competency question: “What is a parameter that represents the quality of water bodies?”
