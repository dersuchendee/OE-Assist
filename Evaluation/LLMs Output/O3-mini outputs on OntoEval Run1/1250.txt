**Yes**

We can answer this CQ by counting the classes that represent disease categories. In this ontology, a disease category is defined as the class :DiseaseCategory and its direct subclasses (e.g. :InfectiousDisease, :ChronicDisease, :GeneticDisease, :EnvironmentalDisease, :DeficiencyDisease). Using a SPARQL query under the closed world assumption, we can count both the base class and its declared subclasses:

----------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>

SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?diseaseCategory) AS ?numDiseaseCategories)
WHERE {
  { ?diseaseCategory a owl:Class ;
                     rdfs:subClassOf :DiseaseCategory . }
  UNION
  { BIND(:DiseaseCategory AS ?diseaseCategory) }
}
----------------------

This query returns the total number of distinct classes that qualify as disease categories according to the ontology.
