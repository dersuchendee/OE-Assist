**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves each flowâ€™s measurement quantity along with its measurement time. (You can add a time filter to target a specific time if needed.)

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?flow ?time ?quantityValue
WHERE {
  ?flow a :Flow .
  ?flow :hasMeasurement ?measurement .
  ?measurement :hasQuantityValue ?quantityValue .
  ?measurement :hasTime ?time .
  # Uncomment and set the following FILTER to restrict to a specific time, e.g.:
  # FILTER(?time = "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question by allowing extraction of the quantity value of a flow at a given time.
