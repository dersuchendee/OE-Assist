**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that extracts the origin of a material and follows the complete trace of processes (by following the initial process and then any subsequent processes via :hasNextProcess):

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?material ?origin ?process
WHERE {
  ?material a :Material ;
            :hasOrigin ?origin .
  # Use a property path to get the complete chain of processes linked from the material
  OPTIONAL { ?material :undergoesProcess/:hasNextProcess* ?process . }
}
ORDER BY ?material ?process
------------------------------------------------------------

This query works under the closed world assumption by only extracting what is explicitly stated in the ontology.
