**No**

The ontology does not directly link the concept of a “material flow” (i.e. instances of :Flow) with rebound effects and added energy requirements. Instead, the properties for energy requirements (via :hasEnergyRequirement) and rebound effects (via :hasReboundEffect) are defined on the class :Process. Although a process produces flows (via :hasOutput), there isn’t an explicit connection from a material flow to its energy requirements or rebound effects. Thus, under the closed world assumption, the competency question can only be answered partially by joining a process (which has the properties of interest) with its output flow.

A partial answer can be extracted with the following SPARQL query:

-----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?flow ?flowLabel ?energyRequirement ?reboundEffect 
WHERE {
  ?proc a :Process .
  ?proc :hasOutput ?flow .
  OPTIONAL { ?flow rdfs:label ?flowLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?proc :hasEnergyRequirement ?energyRequirement . }
  OPTIONAL { ?proc :hasReboundEffect ?reboundEffect . }
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

This query returns flows produced by processes along with any associated energy requirements and rebound effects—even though the answer remains partial with respect to directly modeling a “material flow.”
