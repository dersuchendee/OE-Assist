**Yes**

Assuming that “a certain theatre festival” is represented by an instance of the class Cl_TheatreFestival and its associated plays are linked via the property :hasPlay, the following SPARQL query retrieves the plays for each theatre festival:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  ?festival :hasPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?play

This query answers the competency question by extracting the plays that are part of (or “seen at”) each theatre festival in the ontology under a closed world assumption.
