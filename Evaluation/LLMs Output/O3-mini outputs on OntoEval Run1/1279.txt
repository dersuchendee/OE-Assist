**Yes**

The ontology models this CQ because each musician participates in events that have a location (via the property :hasLocation). Assuming that musician Z is identified (for instance, by an rdfs:label "Z"), you can retrieve the places she visited by following her participation in events.

Below is a SPARQL query that answers the CQ:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?place ?placeLabel ?eventYear
WHERE {
  ?musician a :Musician ;
            rdfs:label "Z" .
  ?musician :participatesIn ?event .
  ?event :hasLocation ?place ;
         :hasTime ?eventYear .
  OPTIONAL { ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel }
}
ORDER BY ?eventYear
------------------------------------------------

This query returns the unique places (and their labels, if available) where musician Z participated in events, along with the event year, thereby answering the competency question.
