**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each theatre festival, the plays that are featured (i.e. the plays that “could be seen”):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :features ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?playLabel
--------------------------------------------------

This query assumes the closed world, meaning only explicitly stated triples (such as a festival having a :features relationship with a play) are taken into account, which matches the ontology’s model.
