**Yes**
Assuming that individuals for musician X and performer Y are represented (for example as :MusicianX and :PerformerY), the following SPARQL query will extract meetings (with their location, time, and reason) where both participated:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?meeting ?location ?time ?reason
WHERE {
  ?meeting a :Meeting ;
           :hasParticipant :MusicianX ;
           :hasParticipant :PerformerY ;
           :hasLocation ?location ;
           :hasTime ?time ;
           :hasReason ?reason .
}
--------------------------------------------------

Under the closed-world assumption, if the meeting exists with both participants, its details will be returned, fully answering the competency question.
