**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that returns each event together with its classification as either Religious or Secular:

---------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?event (IF(BOUND(?religious), "Religious", "Secular") AS ?eventType)
WHERE {
  ?event rdf:type :Event .
  {
    ?event rdf:type :ReligiousEvent .
    BIND(?event AS ?religious)
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?event rdf:type :SecularEvent .
  }
}
ORDER BY ?event
---------------------------------------

This query works under the closed world assumption because it only returns events explicitly classified as either a ReligiousEvent or a SecularEvent according to the ontology.
