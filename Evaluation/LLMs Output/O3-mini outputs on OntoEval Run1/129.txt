**Yes**

We can answer the CQ using the provided ontology because it explicitly models a theatre festival (class :Cl_TheatreFestival) that “hasPlay” (object property :hasPlay) with plays being of type :Cl_Play. Using the closed world assumption, we assume that only the plays linked via :hasPlay to a specific festival are the ones that were shown in that festival.

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each theatre festival, its related plays:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  ?festival :hasPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}

This query lists every instance of a theatre festival along with the plays that were presented event-wise.
