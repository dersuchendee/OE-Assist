Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, extracts each composer along with their network members (such as patrons, institutions, etc.) as specified in the ontology:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?composer ?composerLabel ?networkEntity ?networkEntityLabel
WHERE {
  ?composer a :Composer .
  OPTIONAL { ?composer rdfs:label ?composerLabel. }
  
  ?composer :hasNetworkMember ?networkEntity .
  OPTIONAL { ?networkEntity rdfs:label ?networkEntityLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?composer ?networkEntity
