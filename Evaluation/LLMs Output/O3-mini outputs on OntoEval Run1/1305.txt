**No**
The ontology does not provide explicit constructs to compare similarities and differences among compositions beyond retrieving each composition’s measure information. However, a partial answer can be obtained by listing, for a given tune family (X) and measure type (Y), each composition’s recorded measure value. For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?composition ?compositionLabel ?measureValue
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition ;
               :belongsToTuneFamily :TuneFamilyX ;  # assuming :TuneFamilyX represents tune family X
               :hasMeasure ?measure .
  ?measure :measureType :MeasureTypeY ;             # assuming :MeasureTypeY represents measure Y
           :measureValue ?measureValue .
  OPTIONAL { ?composition rdfs:label ?compositionLabel . }
}

This query retrieves, for the specified tune family X and measure type Y, the measure values for each composition. Although it doesn’t directly compute “similarities” or “differences”, it provides the basis for further analysis under the closed world assumption.
