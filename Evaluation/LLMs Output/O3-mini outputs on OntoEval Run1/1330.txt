**Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?process ?source ?destination
WHERE {
  ?process a :TransportProcess ;
           :transportsSubstance :DissolvedCarbon ;
           :hasSource ?source ;
           :hasDestination ?destination .
}
```

In this query we look for transport processes that specifically transport dissolved carbon and then retrieve their source and destination environmental compartments.
