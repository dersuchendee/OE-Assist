**No**

The ontology does include a connection between ForestSoilComposition and CO2FixationProcess via the property playsRoleIn, but it does not fully capture the "role" played. In the ontology, playsRoleIn is declared as a subproperty of associatedWithRole (whose range is Role), so while we can retrieve which CO2FixationProcess instances a ForestSoilComposition is associated with, we cannot necessarily extract an explicit Role instance for that relationship.

A partial SPARQL query (using the closed world assumption) to retrieve ForestSoilComposition instances associated with CO2FixationProcess and any linked Role (if available) is:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?forestSoil ?process ?role
WHERE {
  ?forestSoil a :ForestSoilComposition .
  ?forestSoil :playsRoleIn ?process .
  ?process a :CO2FixationProcess .
  OPTIONAL { ?process :associatedWithRole ?role . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the available connections; however, because the "role" is not directly modelled or asserted for the process, the ontology only provides a partial answer to the competency question.
