**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves, for each theatre festival, the plays shown (using the property :hasPlay and class :Cl_Play):

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :festivalName ?festivalName ;
            :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName .
}
ORDER BY ?festivalName ?playName

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports the competency question "What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?" under the closed world assumption.
