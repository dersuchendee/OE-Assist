The ontology models measurements of microbiological substances taken in surface waters, linking them to a Recorder and their time of collection. However, it does not include any property (for example, a “hasValue” or “amount” property) that represents the quantitative amount of the substance being recorded. Therefore, while we can extract which Recorder recorded a measurement and when it occurred, we cannot obtain the amount information as asked in the CQ.

Below is a SPARQL query that extracts a partial answer (i.e. which recorders recorded measurements along with the time of recording):
