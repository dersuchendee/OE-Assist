**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the count of distinct individuals that are asserted as belonging to the class DiseaseCategory.

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?dc) AS ?numDistinctDiseaseCategories)
WHERE {
  ?dc rdf:type :DiseaseCategory .
}
------------------------------------------------------

This query works because if the data (i.e. the ABox) contains individuals explicitly typed as :DiseaseCategory, the result will reflect the distinct count.
