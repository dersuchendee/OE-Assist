**Yes**

Assuming a closed world (only explicitly asserted facts hold), we can answer the CQ because the ontology explicitly distinguishes ChemicalMeasurement and PhysicalMeasurement â€“ both of which have the properties :locatedInArea (and :hasSpatialDistribution) that link them to spatial information (i.e. :Area and :SpatialDistribution, respectively).

Below is a SPARQL query that returns, for each measurement (tagged as chemical or physical), its designated area:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?measurement ?measurementType ?area
WHERE {
  {
    ?measurement a :ChemicalMeasurement ;
                 :locatedInArea ?area .
    BIND("ChemicalMeasurement" AS ?measurementType)
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?measurement a :PhysicalMeasurement ;
                 :locatedInArea ?area .
    BIND("PhysicalMeasurement" AS ?measurementType)
  }
}
ORDER BY ?measurementType ?area
------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves chemical and physical measurements along with the areas in which they are located, thereby answering the competency question.
