**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that retrieves the plays associated with a theatre festival (using the classes and properties defined in the ontology):

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?festivalName ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :festivalName ?festivalName .
  ?festivalPlay a :Cl_FestivalPlay ;
                :hasFestival ?festival ;
                :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the name of the theatre festival along with the names of the plays (as defined by the class :Cl_Play and connected via :hasPlay to a festival play instance) and thus fully supports the competency question.
