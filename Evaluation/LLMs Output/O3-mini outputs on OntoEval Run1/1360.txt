**No**

The ontology does not appear to explicitly model the concept of “sources” of a project—even though it links an organ to a project (via the isDescribedBy property), it does not capture any information about sources (for example, bibliographic references or source records) that a project was derived from. Under the closed world assumption, we can only partially answer the CQ by listing the projects an organ is involved in.

A partial SPARQL query could be:

PREFIX organs: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/>
PREFIX arco: <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?organ ?organLabel ?project ?projectLabel
WHERE {
  ?organ a organs:Organ .
  OPTIONAL { ?organ rdfs:label ?organLabel . }
  ?organ arco:isDescribedBy ?project .
  OPTIONAL { ?project rdfs:label ?projectLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?organ ?project

This query retrieves the projects that an organ is involved in, which is a partial answer to the original CQ.
