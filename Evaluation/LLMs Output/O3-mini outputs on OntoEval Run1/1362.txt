**No**  
The ontology does not provide an explicit “reified” connection or dedicated property to indicate that a resource “mentions” an organ. However, one may supply a partial query that retrieves any subject with a property pointing to an entity typed as an organ.

For example:

PREFIX organs: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?resource ?p ?organ
WHERE {
  ?resource ?p ?organ .
  ?organ rdf:type organs:Organ .
}

This query returns subjects (resources) that include an object declared as an organs:Organ, which is a partial answer under the closed world assumption.
