**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model or relate buildings (or bell towers) with a location context (e.g., urban, periurban, rural). Under the closed world assumption only explicitly declared relations and properties are taken into account. Since no property (such as bell:locatedInContext or an equivalent) connects a building with its context, we can only provide a partial answer by retrieving the bell towers.

Below is a partial SPARQL query that retrieves all bell towers. (Note: Since no context property is modelled, the query canâ€™t return the requested context information.)

SELECT ?bellTower ?label
WHERE {
  ?bellTower a bell:BellTower .
  OPTIONAL { ?bellTower rdfs:label ?label. }
