**No**

The ontology does not model any information about the casting process or any related foundry; hence, under the closed world assumption we cannot fully answer which foundry cast a bell. However, a partial query to list the bells available in the ontology can be written as follows:

PREFIX bell: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?bell ?label
WHERE {
  ?bell a bell:Bell .
  OPTIONAL { ?bell rdfs:label ?label . }
}
