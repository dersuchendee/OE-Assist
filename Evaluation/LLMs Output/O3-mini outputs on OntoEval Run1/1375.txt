**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model the concept “musician” or associate participants with roles such as “musician.” Although meetups include participants and places, without further axioms or properties relating a participant’s identity or role (for example via a property or a specific class asserting “musician”) to a person, we cannot fully answer “What places did musician Z visited?” However, we can provide a partial answer by retrieving places linked to meetups where a participant’s label matches "musician Z."

Below is a SPARQL query for a partial answer:

---------------------------------------
PREFIX mtps: <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#>
PREFIX core: <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/core/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?meetup ?place ?placeLabel
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup ;
          mtps:hasParticipant ?participant ;
          mtps:hasPlace ?place .
  ?participant rdfs:label ?participantLabel .
  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?participantLabel), "musician z"))
  OPTIONAL { ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel. }
}
---------------------------------------

This query returns meetups with their associated places for any participant whose label contains "musician Z."
