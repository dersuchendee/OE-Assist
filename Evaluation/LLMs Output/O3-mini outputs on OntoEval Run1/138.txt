**Yes**

The following SPARQL query shows how to extract, for each theatre festival, the plays that could be seen (using the reified pivot class Cl_FestivalPlays and its associated property playName):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  ?festival :hasPlay ?festivalPlay .
  ?festivalPlay :playName ?playName .
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?playName

In a closed world view, this query will only consider the explicitly stated instances and their properties, thus fully answering the query "What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?"
