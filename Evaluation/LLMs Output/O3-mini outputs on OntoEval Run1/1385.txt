**No**

The provided ontology does not explicitly model the relationship indicating that a composition (a :Tune) is identified as a variant in a tune family (a :TuneFamily). In other words, there is no defined property (or reified structure) linking a tune to its corresponding tune family as a variant. Under the closed world assumption, we must assume that if such a relation were not stated in the ontology then it does not hold.

However, if we wanted to retrieve a partial answer—that is, to list the tunes and any potential relations (if any triples happen to indicate some connection in the data)—we could use a query that attempts to find any triple linking a tune and a tune family, even though the expected “variant” relationship is not modeled explicitly:

SELECT ?tune ?tuneLabel ?tuneFamily ?familyLabel ?relation
WHERE {
  ?tune a :Tune .
  OPTIONAL { ?tune rdfs:label ?tuneLabel . }
  
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
  OPTIONAL { ?tuneFamily rdfs:label ?familyLabel . }

  # Attempt to retrieve any relation that connects a tune and a family -
  # note: there is no specific property for "is variant in", so we look for any predicate.
  ?tuneFamily ?relation ?tune .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query will return any observed triple that might incidentally link a tune to a tune family. Since the ontology does not define a clear property for indicating that “composition X is a variant in a tune family,” the CQ is only partially answerable.
