**No**

The current ontology defines the classes :Tune and :TuneFamily but does not specify any property or restriction linking a composition (an instance of :Tune) to a tune family (an instance of :TuneFamily). Under the closed‐world assumption we assume that if such a relation were present it would be explicitly asserted. Consequently, while we can identify compositions and tune families separately, we cannot fully answer “Which tune family does composition X belong to?” because the relevant membership relation is missing. Here is a SPARQL query that returns a partial answer by looking for any asserted relation (in either direction) between a specific composition X and any instance of :TuneFamily (using an OPTIONAL clause):

SELECT ?tuneFamily ?familyLabel
WHERE {
  # Specify composition X (replace the IRI as needed)
  <http://example.org/compositionX> a :Tune .
  
  # Try to find a relation, in either direction, linking composition X to a TuneFamily.
  OPTIONAL {
    { <http://example.org/compositionX> ?p ?tuneFamily }
    UNION
    { ?tuneFamily ?p <http://example.org/compositionX> }
    ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
    OPTIONAL { ?tuneFamily rdfs:label ?familyLabel . }
  }
}

Because the ontology does not currently model the link between compositions and tune families, this query only provides a partial answer.
