**No**

The ontology defines collections (for instance, as classes such as TuneFamily and LyricsFamily which are subclasses of core:Collection) but it does not explicitly model a property or relation that “places” collections within a specific tune family instance. Consequently, while one can query for all individuals (or classes) of type core:Collection, the answer to “What are all collections in this tune family?” cannot be fully extracted because there is no explicit connection linking a particular tune family with the collections under it.

A partial answer can be extracted by listing all resources typed as core:Collection (or by their known subclasses), for example:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/tunes/>
PREFIX core: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/core/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?collection ?label
WHERE {
  ?collection a core:Collection .
  OPTIONAL { ?collection rdfs:label ?label . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query returns all collections as modelled in the ontology without distinguishing which ones belong to a specific tune family as that relationship is not represented.
