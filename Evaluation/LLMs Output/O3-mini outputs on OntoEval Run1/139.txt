**Yes**

Assuming the closed world, the ontology supports this competency question. The plays that can be seen at each festival are linked via the property :featuresPlay. For example, the following SPARQL query returns, for every instance of Cl_TheatreFestival, the plays featured in that festival (including optional labels if available):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  ?festival :featuresPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?festival

This query demonstrates that the competency question "What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?" is answerable given the ontology.
