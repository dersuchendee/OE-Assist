**Yes**

Assuming closed‐world semantics, the CQ “In what city is a certain theatre located?” can be answered with the ontology because there is an object property (:isLocatedIn) whose domain is :Cl_Theatre and whose range is :Cl_City. In a closed world we expect that every theatre instance will have a city specified using :isLocatedIn. Here’s a SPARQL query that returns the theatre and the associated city:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel. }
  
  ?theatre :isLocatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel. }
}

This query directly extracts the city for each theatre using the :isLocatedIn property, thereby fully supporting the CQ.
