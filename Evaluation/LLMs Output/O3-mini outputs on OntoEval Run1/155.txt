**Yes**

We can answer this CQ by checking for individuals of type :Cl_Theatre that are linked via the property :locatedIn to a city. Under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, only explicitly stated locations are returned. For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves each theatre and the city in which it is located:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?theatre ?city
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre ;
           :locatedIn ?city .
}
ORDER BY ?theatre
