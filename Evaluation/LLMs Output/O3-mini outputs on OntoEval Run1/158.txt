Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, extracts complete information about productions that have a premier (using :Cl_ProductionPremier) along with the theatre where they played and any associated review (including newspaper and star rating). This query answers a competency question such as “Which productions at a given theatre have a recorded premiere date and what are the review details (star rating and newspaper)?” by linking productions, their premier information, and review data.
