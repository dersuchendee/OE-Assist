**Yes**

We can answer the CQ using the ontology because it provides a modelling of theatres (instances of :Cl_Theatre) linked to their locations (instances of :Cl_TheatreLocation) via the property :isLocatedIn, and the locationâ€™s city is given by the data property :cityName. Under the closed world assumption, we assume that only the stated relationships and facts hold. Accordingly, the following SPARQL query can be used:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?theatre ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :isLocatedIn ?location .
  ?location :cityName ?cityName .
}
