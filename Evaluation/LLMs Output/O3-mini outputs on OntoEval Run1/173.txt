**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves a city (instance of Cl_City) together with the country it is explicitly declared to be located in via the :isLocatedInCountry property. Under the closed world assumption the query returns only those cities for which the country has been explicitly asserted:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedInCountry ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?city
------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question “In what country is a certain city located?” is answerable using the ontology since both the class Cl_City and the property :isLocatedInCountry (with range Cl_Country) are present in the ontology.
