**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves for each city (or a given city) the country in which it is located, based on the explicit association provided by the instance of Cl_CityCountry:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  # Identify cities
  ?city a :Cl_City ;
        :cityName ?cityName .
  # Find an instance that links the city to its country
  ?cityCountry a :Cl_CityCountry ;
               :hasCity ?city ;
               :hasCountry ?country .
  ?country :countryName ?countryName .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology explicitly models a relationship between a city (of type Cl_City) and its country (via instances of the class Cl_CityCountry and the object property :hasCountry), thereby supporting the CQ "In what country is a certain city located?" under the closed world assumption.
