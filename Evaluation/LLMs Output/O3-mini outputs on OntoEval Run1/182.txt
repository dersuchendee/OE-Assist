**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that uses the ontology’s classes and properties to retrieve, for any given city, the country in which that city is located:

—————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
  ?country a :Cl_Country .
  ?country :countryName ?countryName .
}
ORDER BY ?cityLabel
—————————————————————————————

Under the closed world assumption, this query will return the full answer to the competency question “In what country is a certain city located?” as long as the data is present in the ontology.
