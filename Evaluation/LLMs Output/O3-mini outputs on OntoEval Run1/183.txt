**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves, for each city in the ontology, the country in which it is located. Under the closed world assumption, we assume that any city that is not explicitly linked to a country does not qualify.

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :cityName ?cityName . }  
  ?city :locatedIn ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?country :countryName ?countryName . }
}
---------------------------------

This query is able to extract the answer to "In what country is a certain city located?" based on the modelling of city and country within the ontology.
