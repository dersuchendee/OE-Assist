**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, extracts for each city in the ontology the country in which it is located:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
  ?city :isLocatedInCountry ?cityLocation .
  ?cityLocation :countryName ?countryName .
}
---------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology models the competency question “In what country is a certain city located?” by linking a city (instance of :Cl_City) through the object property :isLocatedInCountry to a city location (of type :Cl_CityLocation) having the data property :countryName.
