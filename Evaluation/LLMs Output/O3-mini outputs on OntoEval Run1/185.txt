**Yes**

Assuming we know which city we’re interested in (or want to list all such cities with their corresponding country), you could write a query such as:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
}
--------------------------------------------------

Under the closed‐world assumption, we assume that if a city is not explicitly linked to a country using the property :isLocatedIn, then that city does not have a country assigned in the ontology.
