Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each production, the play on which it is based. In this ontology the production is linked via the property :hasBasis to an instance of :Cl_ProductionBasedOnPlay, which in turn is connected via the property :basedOn to an instance of :Cl_Play.

This query under the closed-world assumption checks for productions that have a basis and returns the associated play along with optional title information.
