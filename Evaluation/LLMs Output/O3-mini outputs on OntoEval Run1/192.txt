**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each production, the play on which it is based:

PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?production a theatre:TheatreProduction ;
              theatre:hasPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?production

This query returns every production along with the play used in that production, which answers the competency question.
