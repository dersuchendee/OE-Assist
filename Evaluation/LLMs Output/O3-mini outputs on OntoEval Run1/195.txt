**Yes**

We can retrieve the play that is the basis of a production by using the defined relation (through the inverse properties hasPlay and isBasisOf). For example, the following SPARQL query returns each production along with the play that is its basis:

----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
  ?production :hasPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?production
----------------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, only the productions explicitly linked to a play via the :hasPlay property are returned.
