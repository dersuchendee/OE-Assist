**Yes**

The ontology includes a property (:isBasedOn) with domain Cl_Production and range Cl_Play, which allows us to ask “What play is the basis of this production?” Here’s a SPARQL query that answers the competency question under a closed world assumption:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :isBasedOn ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?production

This query retrieves all productions and the plays they are based on.
