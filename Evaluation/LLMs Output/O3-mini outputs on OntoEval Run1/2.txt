**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves each sourceâ€™s credibility from the ontology:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?source ?credibilityLevel ?assessedBy
WHERE {
  ?source a :Cl_Source ;
          :hasCredibilityAssessment ?assessment .
  ?assessment :hasCredibilityLevel ?credibilityLevel .
  OPTIONAL { ?assessment :assessedBy ?assessedBy . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question "Which is the credibility of a source?" by extracting, for every source (:Cl_Source), its associated credibility level (via :hasCredibilityAssessment and :hasCredibilityLevel) and optionally the person who assessed it (via :assessedBy).
