**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves each production together with the play on which it is based (using the production–play reification in the ontology):

───────────────────────────── 
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?production ?playName
WHERE {
  ?prodPlay a :Cl_ProductionPlay ;
            :hasProduction ?production ;
            :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
ORDER BY ?production
───────────────────────────── 

This query leverages the ontology’s modeling of productions via the reified link (an instance of Cl_ProductionPlay) that connects a production with its underlying play.
