**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the play name which serves as the basis for a given production:

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?production ?playName
WHERE {
  ?production rdf:type :Cl_Production .
  ?production :basedOnPlay ?productionPlay .
  ?productionPlay :playName ?playName .
}
--------------------------------

In this query, we assume that productions are explicitly asserted as instances of :Cl_Production and that the link from a production to its underlying play is modeled via the property :basedOnPlay, while the playâ€™s name is provided by the data property :playName. Under the closed world assumption, only those productions and plays that are stated in the ontology will be returned.
