**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves for each production the play that forms its basis:

-------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :basedOnPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName. }
}
-------------------------

This query assumes that productions are explicitly linked via the “basedOnPlay” property to a play, which is consistent with the ontology provided.
