**Yes**

We can answer the CQ "What play is the basis of this production?" since the ontology includes the property :basedOnPlay (with domain :Cl_Production and range :Cl_Play). Under the closed world assumption, we assume any production that is based on a play is completely described by this relation. The following SPARQL query extracts the production along with the play that is the basis for it:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :basedOnPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
