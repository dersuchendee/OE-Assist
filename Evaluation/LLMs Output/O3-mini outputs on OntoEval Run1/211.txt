Below is a SPARQL query that uses the reified membership information (via Cl_EnsembleMembership along with its membershipStartDate and membershipEndDate data properties) to return the actors (members) of a given ensemble that were active at a specified point in time. (Replace :TargetEnsemble with the IRI of the ensemble you are querying, and adjust "2020-01-01" with the desired date.)

SELECT ?member ?memberName ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership ;
              :membershipOf :TargetEnsemble ;
              :member ?member ;
              :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate . }
  ?member :hasName ?memberName .
  
  # Filter: Only include membership valid at the given point in time
  FILTER(
    xsd:date("2020-01-01") >= ?membershipStartDate &&
    ( !bound(?membershipEndDate) || xsd:date("2020-01-01") <= ?membershipEndDate )
  )
}
ORDER BY ?memberName

This query answers the competency question “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” by selecting ensemble memberships for a given ensemble and filtering them based on the membership validity dates.
