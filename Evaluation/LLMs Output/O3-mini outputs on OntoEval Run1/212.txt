**No**
The provided ontology does not model ensemble membership with an associated time component. We can retrieve the members of an ensemble, but we cannot filter them “at a certain point in time.” A partial answer can be obtained with the following query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/theatre_ontology#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?name
WHERE {
  ?ensemble rdf:type :Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?member .
  OPTIONAL { ?member :hasName ?name . }
