Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given ensemble and a specified point in time, the actors that are members during that time. (In this example the ensemble is identified by its URI, and the given time is provided as a constant; you may replace these values as needed.)

SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel
WHERE {
  ?membership a :EnsembleMembership ;
              :ensemble <http://example.org/theatreontology#YourEnsemble> ;
              :member ?actor ;
              :during ?interval .
  ?interval :hasStartDate ?start ;
            :hasEndDate ?end .
  # Replace the date below with the point in time you wish to check.
  FILTER(xsd:dateTime("2009-09-10T00:00:00") >= ?start && xsd:dateTime("2009-09-10T00:00:00") <= ?end)
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}

This query works under the closed world assumption to answer the competency question: "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?"
