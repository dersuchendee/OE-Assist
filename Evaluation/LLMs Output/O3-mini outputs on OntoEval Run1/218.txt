**Yes**

The following SPARQL query uses the closed‚Äêworld assumption to retrieve the actors that are members of a specified ensemble (here represented by an IRI, e.g. :MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble) at a given point in time (here given as "2009-09-14T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime). It assumes that actor membership is reified via :Cl_EnsembleMembership with properties linking an actor to an ensemble via :hasMembership and :membershipOf, and that membership start and (optionally) membership end dates are recorded via :membershipStart and :membershipEnd, respectively.

This query extracts the actors who have a membership in the given ensemble where the specified point in time falls after their membership start date and, if a membership end date is provided, before that end date.
