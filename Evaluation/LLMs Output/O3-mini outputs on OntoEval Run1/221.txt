**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that—in a closed‐world view—retrieves, for a specified ensemble and a given point in time, the members that joined on or before that time:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?member ?memberLabel ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  # Assume a specific ensemble is known (replace VALUE with its URI or label)
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble ;
            rdfs:label "Name of Ensemble" ;
            :hasMember ?member .
  
  # Retrieve the membership date for each member
  ?member :hasMembershipDate ?membershipDate .
  
  # Optionally get the member’s label
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
  
  # Only include members who joined on or before the specified date (adjust the date as needed)
  FILTER(?membershipDate <= "2009-09-10"^^xsd:date)
}
ORDER BY ?membershipDate

This query shows that the CQ—“Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?”—is answerable using the ontology, since the ensemble-member relationship (via :hasMember) combined with the membership date (via :hasMembershipDate) permits filtering by a given time point.
