**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given ensemble (here, for example, :MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble) and a specified point in time, the individuals (actors) that have a membership at that time:

-------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?member ?memberName ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  :MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  :MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble :hasMember ?member .
  ?member :hasEnsembleMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :atTime ?membershipTime .
  FILTER(?membershipTime = "2009-09-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime)
  OPTIONAL { ?member :hasName ?memberName . }
}
-------------------------------------------------------

In this query the closed world assumption is in effect (only explicitly stated membership at the given time is returned), and the CQ “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” is answerable.
