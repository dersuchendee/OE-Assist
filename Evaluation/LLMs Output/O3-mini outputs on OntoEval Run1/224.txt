**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld interpretation, retrieves the actor members of a given ensemble (for example, MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble) at a specified time (e.g. "2009-09-01T00:00:00Z"):

SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  # Select a specific ensemble
  :MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  
  # Find actors who performed in that ensemble and have a reified membership carrying a time stamp
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor ;
         :performedIn :MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble ;
         :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :atTime ?membershipTime .
  
  # Closed world: filter for the given point in time
  FILTER(?membershipTime = "2009-09-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime)
  
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}

This query shows that the ontology supports answering the CQ "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" by linking ensemble membership (via the reified membership with its atTime property) and the ensemble relation via :performedIn and :memberOf.
