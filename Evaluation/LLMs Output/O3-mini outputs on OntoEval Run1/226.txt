**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query to extract the members (actors) of a given ensemble at a specific time period:

--------------------------------------------------

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorName
WHERE {
  # Assuming the ensemble is identified (e.g., Ensemble_GrandTheatre_MerchantOfVenice)
  :Ensemble_GrandTheatre_MerchantOfVenice :hasEnsembleMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :hasMember ?actor ;
              :hasTimePeriod ?time .
  # Use FILTER to select the desired time period (e.g. "September 2009")
  FILTER(?time = "September 2009")
  
  OPTIONAL { ?actor :actorName ?actorName . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query we assume that the ensemble is already known (here using the identifier :Ensemble_GrandTheatre_MerchantOfVenice) and that the time period is exactly "September 2009". This demonstrates that the ontology models the information needed to answer the CQ "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" under a closed world assumption.
