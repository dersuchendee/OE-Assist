**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the names of ensemble members for a given ensemble at a specified date. (Under the closed‐world assumption, we assume that all membership information is complete.) You can replace the placeholder date (e.g., "2007-01-01"^^xsd:date) with the “certain point in time” you wish to query.

SELECT ?ensemble ?memberName ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble rdf:type :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_EnsembleMembership .
  ?membership :memberName ?memberName .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
  
  # Filter for memberships that are active at the specified date.
  # For example, if membershipDate marks the date when the person became a member,
  # you might assume membership is active from that date on.
  # Here we retrieve all memberships with a membershipDate on or before the given date.
  FILTER(?membershipDate <= "2007-01-01"^^xsd:date)
}
ORDER BY ?ensemble ?memberName

This query shows that the ontology models ensembles and their membership (via reified type :Cl_EnsembleMembership) and stores the membership date – thus making it possible to answer “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?”
