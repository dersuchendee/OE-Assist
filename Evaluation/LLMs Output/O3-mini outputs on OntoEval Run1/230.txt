**Yes**
Below is one example SPARQL query that, given a specific ensemble (?ensemble) and a target date (?targetDate), returns the ensemble’s members (using the reified membership via :Cl_EnsembleMembership) whose membership record is valid at that time:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?member .
  ?member :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
  
  # Filter to the given point in time (e.g., "2007-01-01")
  FILTER(?membershipDate = "2007-01-01"^^xsd:date)
  
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?ensemble ?membershipDate

In a closed‐world assumption, if no membership record with that date exists then the query returns no results, which is consistent with the idea that only explicitly stated membership data is considered.
