**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, returns the persons (i.e. members) linked via an ensemble membership whose membership date qualifies them as being active “at a certain point in time” (for example, before or on a given date). (In this query we assume that if a person’s membership date is on or before the given date, then that person is regarded as a member on that day.)

Assuming the ontology uses the classes and properties below:
• :Cl_Ensemble represents an ensemble.
• :hasMember links an ensemble to an instance of :Cl_EnsembleMembership.
• :membershipDate (with range xsd:date) is a data property on :Cl_EnsembleMembership.
• :member links an ensemble membership to a person (of type :Cl_Person).

You can write a query such as:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?ensembleLabel ?member ?memberLabel ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  # Select the ensemble of interest (here filtered by its label; you could also specify by its URI)
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble ;
            rdfs:label ?ensembleLabel .
  FILTER(?ensembleLabel = "Your Ensemble Name") .

  # Find its membership instances
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate ;
              :member ?member .

  # Optional: get the member’s label if available.
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
  
  # Return only members that joined on or before the given date (i.e. are active at that time).
  FILTER(?membershipDate <= "2007-01-01"^^xsd:date)
}
ORDER BY ?member
--------------------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the ontology models the competency question “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” since we can retrieve the ensemble’s members based on the membership date property using a SPARQL query.
