**Yes**

Assuming that the “certain ensemble” is an instance of :Cl_Ensemble and that its membership information is represented via the reified class :Cl_EnsembleMembership (which carries information about the member’s name and the membership date), we can write a SPARQL query to extract the members of a given ensemble at a specific point in time. For example, if we wish to find those members whose membership date equals a chosen date (here “2007-01-01” as a placeholder), the query would be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?memberName ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble ;
            :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership ;
              :memberName ?memberName ;
              :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
  FILTER(?membershipDate = "2007-01-01"^^xsd:date)
}

In a closed-world setting, you would need to ensure that the data about ensemble membership is complete; this query relies on the ontology’s reification pattern to connect ensembles with their members and the relevant dates.
