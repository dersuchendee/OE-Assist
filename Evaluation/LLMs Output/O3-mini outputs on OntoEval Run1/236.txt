**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the plays (with their titles) written by a given author (in this case, William Shakespeare):

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?title
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :dp_title ?title ;
        :op_writtenBy ?author .
  FILTER(?author = :WilliamShakespeare)
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the ontology connects plays to their authors via the property :op_writtenBy and provides the author’s name via the data property :dp_authorName. Thus, the competency question “What plays did a certain author write?” is answerable by the ontology.
