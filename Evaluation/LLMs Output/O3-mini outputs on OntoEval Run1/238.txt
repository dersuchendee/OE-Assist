**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the plays written by a given author (for example, William Shakespeare):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a theatre:Author .
  ?author theatre:wrote ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  FILTER(?author = theatre:WilliamShakespeare)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “What plays did a certain author write?” by looking for all plays that are linked to an author via the property theatre:wrote.
