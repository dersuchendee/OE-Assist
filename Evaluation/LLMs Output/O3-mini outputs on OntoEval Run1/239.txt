**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that, given a specific author (e.g., using its IRI), retrieves the plays written by that author:
 
------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?writingEvent a :Cl_WritingEvent ;
                :hasAuthor ?author ;
                :hasPlay ?play .
  FILTER(?author = <http://www.example.org/test#WilliamShakespeare>)
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel. }
}
------------------------------------------------------------
 
Under the closed-world assumption, all information about writing events (linking authors and plays) is explicitly stated in the ontology; thus, this query fully answers the CQ "What plays did a certain author write?"
