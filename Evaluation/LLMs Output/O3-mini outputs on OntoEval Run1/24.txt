**Yes**

The ontology defines water body types as classes (e.g., :Cl_WaterBody, :Cl_InlandWaterBody, :Cl_CoastalWaterBody, :Cl_Lake, :Cl_River, etc.) which can be listed by retrieving the classes that are equal to or subclasses (using rdfs:subClassOf*) of :Cl_WaterBody. Under the closed world assumption, we assume that these are all the water body types. The following SPARQL query extracts the complete list:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?waterBodyType
WHERE {
  ?waterBodyType rdfs:subClassOf* :Cl_WaterBody .
}
ORDER BY ?waterBodyType
