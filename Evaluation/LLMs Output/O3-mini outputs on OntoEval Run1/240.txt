**Yes**

Assuming a given author is identified by their URI (e.g., :AuthorX), the following SPARQL query will return all plays written by that author along with their titles (if provided):

PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?title
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  ?play :hasAuthor :AuthorX .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasTitle ?title . }
}

This query leverages the fact that the ontology defines plays as having at least one author via the :hasAuthor property, so the CQ “What plays did a certain author write?” is answerable under a closed world assumption.
