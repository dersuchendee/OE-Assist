**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, returns the plays written by a given author (replace the placeholder IRI with the specific author you are interested in):

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  # Select the given author (replace with the actual author IRI)
  VALUES ?author { <http://www.example.org/test#GivenAuthor> } .

  # The ontology models that an author writes plays via either the property
  # :authorOf or its subproperty :wrotePlay. Here we assume the author is linked to a play.
  ?author :authorOf ?play .
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query extracts all plays (and their names, if provided) that were written by the specific author in the ontology, fully supporting the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?"
