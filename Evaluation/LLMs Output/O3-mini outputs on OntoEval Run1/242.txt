**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves for a given author the plays they have written. (Replace the example author IRI with the appropriate one for your case.)

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?author ?authorLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorLabel . }

  ?author :hasWritten ?authorship .
  ?authorship :hasWrittenPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query follows the modeled chain in the ontology (from Cl_Author via hasWritten to Cl_Authorship and then via hasWrittenPlay to Cl_Play) to answer the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?"
