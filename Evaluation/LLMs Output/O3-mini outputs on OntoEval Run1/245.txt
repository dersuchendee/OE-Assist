**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the plays written by an author (using a “closed world” that only returns what is explicitly asserted):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?author ?authorName ?play ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  ?author :hasName ?authorName .
  ?author :wrotePlay ?play .
  ?play :hasTitle ?playTitle .
}
ORDER BY ?authorName ?playTitle
