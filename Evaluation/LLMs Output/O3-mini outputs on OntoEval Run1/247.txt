**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the plays written by a given author (in this example, by WilliamShakespeare):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  :WilliamShakespeare a :Cl_Author .
  :WilliamShakespeare :wrote ?play .
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}

This query shows that the ontology models the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" with the property :wrote connecting authors to plays.
