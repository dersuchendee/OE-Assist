Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the plays written by a specified author (here, for example, "William Shakespeare"). This query navigates from an instance of Cl_Author via the property :hasAuthorPlay to a Cl_AuthorPlay instance and then from that instance via :writtenPlay to the corresponding Cl_Play.

SELECT ?author ?authorLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorLabel . }
  
  ?author :hasAuthorPlay ?authorPlay .
  ?authorPlay :writtenPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  
  # Filter to a specific author if needed; example shown for "William Shakespeare"
  FILTER(BOUND(?authorLabel) && LCASE(?authorLabel) = "william shakespeare")
}

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" by extracting the connection between an author and the plays he or she has written.
