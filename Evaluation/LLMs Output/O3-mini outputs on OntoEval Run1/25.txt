**No**  
The ontology does not explicitly model a relation linking a product with the manufacturer. Under the closed world assumption, we cannot deduce from the available axioms that a product “has” a manufacturer even though the OS (story) requires that information. However, we can provide a partial answer query that lists all products along with any individual explicitly typed as manufacturer.

For example, a SPARQL query to extract this partial information is:

PREFIX prod: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/product/>
PREFIX actor: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actor/>

SELECT ?product ?manufacturer
WHERE {
  ?product a prod:Product .
  ?manufacturer a actor:manufacturer .
}

This query does not capture an explicit connection between a given product and its manufacturer—and that is why the CQ is only partially answerable from the provided ontology.
