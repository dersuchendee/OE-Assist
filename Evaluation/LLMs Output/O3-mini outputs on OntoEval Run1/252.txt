**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that, given an instance of an author, retrieves the plays that they wrote:

-----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?author ?authorName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  ?author :wrotePlay ?play .
  ?author :authorName ?authorName .
  ?play :playName ?playName .

  # For a specific authorâ€”replace "SpecificAuthorName" as needed
  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?authorName), "specificauthorname"))
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" is fully answerable using the ontology (under the closed world assumption) because the property :wrotePlay connects an instance of :Cl_Author to an instance of :Cl_Play, and both classes provide the necessary data properties to retrieve names.
