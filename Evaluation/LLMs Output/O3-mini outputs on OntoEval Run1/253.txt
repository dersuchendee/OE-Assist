**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given author, the titles of the plays they have written according to the ontology.

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  # Here, we assume that the authorâ€™s identity is given via an rdfs:label.
  # Replace "William Shakespeare" with the desired author name.
  ?author rdfs:label "William Shakespeare" .
  
  ?author :hasWritten ?authorship .
  ?authorship :playTitle ?playTitle .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query works under the closed world assumption because it retrieves only those plays that are explicitly connected through the :hasWritten property from the specified author.
