**Yes**

The ontology defines a class for authors (:Cl_Author) and an object property (:wrotePlay) whose domain is :Cl_Author and range is :Cl_Play. Thus, given a specific author, you can extract the plays they wrote using a SPARQL query. For example, if you want to retrieve the plays written by a particular author (say, with IRI <http://www.example.org/test#WilliamShakespeare>), you could write:

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  <http://www.example.org/test#WilliamShakespeare> a :Cl_Author ;
                                               :wrotePlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
--------------------------------

This query returns the plays along with their labels (if available) for the given author, thereby answering the competency question under a closed world assumption.
