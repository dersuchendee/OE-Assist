**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a specific author (identified by its URI or label), retrieves all the plays written by that author:

-------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?author ?authorLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorLabel . }
  
  ?author :wrotePlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  
  # To focus on a specific author, you can filter either by URI or by label.
  # Example filtering by a given author URI:
  # FILTER(?author = <http://www.example.org/test#GivenAuthor>)

  # Alternatively, filtering by a known author label:
  # FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?authorLabel), "shakespeare"))
}
-------------------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, we assume that the set of triples in the ontology fully describe the relationships. Thus, if an author is not asserted to have a :wrotePlay relationship with any play, then the query will correctly return no results.
