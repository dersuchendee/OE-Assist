**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, given an author, retrieves the titles of the plays they wrote:

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?author ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author ;
          :hasWritten ?authorship .
  ?authorship :playTitle ?playTitle .
  # To select a specific author, you could add a filter, for example:
  # FILTER(?author = :SpecificAuthor)
}
--------------------------------

This query uses the reification class :Cl_Authorship (which connects :Cl_Author with :Cl_Play) to return the play titles written by a given author under the closed world assumption (i.e. if an author has no explicitly connected written play then no title will be returned).
