**No**  
The ontology does not model a connection between products and their manufacturers. In other words, while the ontology lists an individual (or role) for a manufacturer, there is no property or relation linking a product (or resource) to the manufacturer. Under the closed‐world assumption, we must assume that if no such relation is asserted then the information is absent. The following SPARQL query provides a partial answer by listing available products (modeled as resources) and, if available, any asserted manufacturer (using a (non‐existing) :hasManufacturer property):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actor/>
PREFIX res: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/resourceODP/>

SELECT ?product ?manufacturer
WHERE {
  ?product a res:Resource .
  OPTIONAL { ?product :hasManufacturer ?manufacturer . }
}
------------------------------------------------

Since the ontology does not define the property :hasManufacturer or link products to their manufacturer, this query may return products without the manufacturer information.
