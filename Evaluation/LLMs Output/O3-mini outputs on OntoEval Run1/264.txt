**Yes**

Assuming that each play instance is linked to an instance of the play time period via the property :hasPlayTimePeriod—with datatype properties :startYear and :endYear defining the period during which the play was written—you can extract the answer with the following SPARQL query:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playName ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
  ?play :hasPlayTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :startYear ?startYear .
  ?timePeriod :endYear ?endYear .
  # Optionally, filter for a specific play, e.g. "The Merchant of Venice":
  # FILTER(?playName = "The Merchant of Venice")
}
---------------------------------

In a closed-world reading of the ontology, the play’s writing period is modelled explicitly via the pivot class :Cl_PlayTimePeriod and its properties.
