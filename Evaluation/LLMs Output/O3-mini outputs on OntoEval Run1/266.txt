**Yes**

The ontology includes the property “writtenDuring” (with domain Cl_Play) for plays, which lets us extract the time period during which a play was written. For example, if we want to retrieve the time period for (say) “The Merchant of Venice,” we can write a SPARQL query similar to the one below:

---------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?writtenDuring
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?writtenDuring .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?label . }
  # Uncomment the next line to filter by a specific play title:
  # FILTER(regex(?label, "Merchant of Venice", "i"))
}
---------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves all plays along with their associated “writtenDuring” value, allowing us to answer the competency question under the closed world assumption.
