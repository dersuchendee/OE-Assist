**Yes**

We can answer “During what time period was a certain play written?” by retrieving the play’s :writtenDuring value from the ontology. For example, if we want to know when “The Merchant of Venice” was written, a SPARQL query could be:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?title ?writtenDuring
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :hasTitle ?title ;
        :writtenDuring ?writtenDuring .
  FILTER(LCASE(?title) = "the merchant of venice")
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the play, its title, and its “writtenDuring” time period from the ontology, thereby fully answering the competency question under the closed world assumption.
