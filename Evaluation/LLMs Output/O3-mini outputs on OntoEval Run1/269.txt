**Yes**

The ontology provides data properties for plays that record the writing period (dp_writtenStartDate and dp_writtenEndDate). Therefore, the competency question “During what time period was a certain play written?” is answerable by the ontology. Under the closed world assumption, we assume that all such information is explicitly given.

Below is a sample SPARQL query to extract the writing period for plays:

------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?writtenStartDate ?writtenEndDate
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :dp_writtenStartDate ?writtenStartDate .
  ?play :dp_writtenEndDate ?writtenEndDate .
}
------------------------------------------------------------------

This query returns each play along with its recorded writing start and end dates, thus answering the CQ.
