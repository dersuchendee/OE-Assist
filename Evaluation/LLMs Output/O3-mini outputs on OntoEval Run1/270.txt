**Yes**

We can answer this CQ using the ontology. In our ontology the class :Cl_Play is connected with the data property :writtenDuring that indicates the time period during which the play was written. Here is an example SPARQL query that extracts the play and its writing period:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?writtenDuring
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?writtenDuring .
}

This query returns for each play (for example, :MerchantOfVenice) the value of its :writtenDuring property (e.g., "1596-1598").
