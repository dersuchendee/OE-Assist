**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves each playâ€™s writing period (its start and end dates) by following the :hasWritingPeriod relation from a :Cl_Play to a :Cl_PlayWritingPeriod, and then extracting its :writingStartDate and :writingEndDate:

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?writingStartDate ?writingEndDate
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        rdfs:label ?playLabel ;
        :hasWritingPeriod ?period .
  ?period :writingStartDate ?writingStartDate ;
          :writingEndDate ?writingEndDate .
}
ORDER BY ?play

This query fully answers the competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" according to the ontology.
