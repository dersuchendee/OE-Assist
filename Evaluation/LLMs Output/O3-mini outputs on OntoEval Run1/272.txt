**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, extracts the time period during which a given play was written. In this example we select all plays (with their names) along with the associated time period (e.g. “1596-1598”) provided via the property “writtenDuring.”

SELECT ?play ?playName ?timePeriod ?timePeriodVal
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName ;
        :writtenDuring ?period .
  ?period :timePeriod ?timePeriodVal .
  BIND(?period AS ?timePeriod)
}
ORDER BY ?playName

This query returns, for each play, its name and the corresponding time period during which it was written—as required by the CQ "During what time period was a certain play written?"
