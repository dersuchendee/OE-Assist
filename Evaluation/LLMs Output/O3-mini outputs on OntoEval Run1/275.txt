**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology explicitly reifies the “written during” relation between a play and its writing period using the reified class (here, :Cl_PlayWrittenPeriod) and the property :writtenDuring, we can extract the time period for a given play. Under the closed world assumption, we assume only statements explicitly stated in the ontology hold true.

For example, the following SPARQL query returns each play (with an optional play name) along with its associated writing time period (via the data property :timePeriod on the reified instance):

-----------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playName ?period ?timePeriodValue
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
  
  ?play :writtenDuring ?period .
  ?period :timePeriod ?timePeriodValue .
}
-----------------------------

This query demonstrates that the competency question “During what time period was a certain play written?” is supported by the ontology.
