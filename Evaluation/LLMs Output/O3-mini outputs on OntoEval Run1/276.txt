**Yes**

The ontology defines a pivot class (:Cl_PlayCreation) that is a subclass of both :Cl_Play and :Cl_TimePeriod. In addition, it defines an object property (:wasWrittenDuring) linking a play to its creation period and a data property (:creationPeriod) for expressing the time period as a string. Under a closed‐world assumption, we assume that a play’s writing period is completely captured via these properties. Therefore, the following SPARQL query can be used (optionally filtering by title—for example, “Merchant of Venice”—if you are interested in a particular play):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?title ?creationPeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :wasWrittenDuring ?playCreation .
  ?playCreation :creationPeriod ?creationPeriod .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playTitle ?title . }
  # If you wish to restrict to a specific play, uncomment the following filter:
  # FILTER(CONTAINS(lcase(?title), "merchant of venice"))
}
