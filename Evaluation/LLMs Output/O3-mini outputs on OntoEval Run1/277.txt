**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each play, the time period (via its time period value) during which it was written. Under a closed world assumption the query only returns plays that explicitly have the property :writtenDuring:

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?timePeriodValue
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :timePeriodValue ?timePeriodValue .
}
ORDER BY ?play
