**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed-world assumption, returns for each play the number of acts it contains by counting the associated act individuals:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play (COALESCE(?playName, "Unknown") AS ?Name) (COUNT(?act) AS ?actCount)
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasAct ?act . }
}
GROUP BY ?play ?playName
ORDER BY ?play

This query extracts each play (of type Cl_Play), its name (if available), and counts the number of acts linked via the hasAct property, thereby answering the competency question.
