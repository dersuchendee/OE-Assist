**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves for a given play (for example “The Merchant of Venice”) its recorded number of acts via the property “containsActs”:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :containsActs ?numberOfActs .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }

  # Filter for a particular play – change the literal as needed
  FILTER(BOUND(?playLabel) && LCASE(?playLabel) = "the merchant of venice")
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" because the property :containsActs on class :Cl_Play can be used to extract the answer.
