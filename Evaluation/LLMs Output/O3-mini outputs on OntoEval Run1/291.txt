**Yes**

We can extract the number of acts recorded for a play (using the :containsActs data property) by querying for plays along with their title and the number of acts. For example, to get the number of acts for “The Merchant of Venice”, you could use the following SPARQL query:

-------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?title ?acts
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :hasTitle ?title ;
        :containsActs ?acts .
  FILTER(?title = "The Merchant of Venice")
}
-------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the play (its URI), its title, and the integer value recorded with :containsActs in the ontology—thus fully answering the CQ under a closed world assumption.
