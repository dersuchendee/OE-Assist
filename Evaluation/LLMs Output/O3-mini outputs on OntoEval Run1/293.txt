**Yes**

Assuming the “particular play” is provided (for example, via a parameter or known individual such as :MerchantOfVenice), you can retrieve its number of acts using a query like this:

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :hasNumberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
  # Optionally, filter for a specific play:
  FILTER(?play = :MerchantOfVenice)  
}
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Under the closed-world assumption, we assume that if a play does not have a recorded number of acts, then it has none, so this query completely answers the question by extracting the number of acts for each (or a specified) play.
