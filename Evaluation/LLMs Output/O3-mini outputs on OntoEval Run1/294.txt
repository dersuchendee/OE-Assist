**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that counts the number of acts for a specific play (in this case, "The Merchant of Venice"):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play (COUNT(?act) AS ?actCount)
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        rdfs:label "The Merchant of Venice" ;
        :hasAct ?act .
}
GROUP BY ?play

This query retrieves the play with label "The Merchant of Venice", counts all related :Cl_PlayAct instances (i.e. its acts), and returns the total count.
