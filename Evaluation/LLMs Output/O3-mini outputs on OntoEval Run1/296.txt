Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the number of acts that a given play contains. In this ontology, plays (instances of :Cl_Play) are linked to a reified play acts entity (of type :Cl_PlayActs) that holds the integer value via the property :hasNumberOfActs.

SELECT ?playName ?acts
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName .
  ?playActs a :Cl_PlayActs ;
            :hasPlay ?play ;
            :hasNumberOfActs ?acts .
}
ORDER BY ?playName

This query answers the competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" by linking each play to its associated acts value.
