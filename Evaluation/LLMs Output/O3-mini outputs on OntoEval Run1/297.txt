**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that returns the number of acts for a given play (here, “The Merchant of Venice” is used as an example):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?playName ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName ;
        :containsActs ?playActs .
  ?playActs :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
  FILTER(?playName = "The Merchant of Venice")
}

This query is answerable under a closed world assumption as all relevant classes (Cl_Play, Cl_PlayActs) and data property (:numberOfActs) that reify the number of acts for a play are modeled in the ontology.
