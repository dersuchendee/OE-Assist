**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for each play its associated number of acts:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?play ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play rdf:type :Cl_Play .
  ?play :containsActs ?playActs .
  ?playActs :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the question “How many acts does a particular play contain?” by linking a play to its reified “acts” information.
