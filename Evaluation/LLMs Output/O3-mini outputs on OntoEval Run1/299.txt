**Yes**

Assuming that the relevant data has been asserted using the pivot class for play structure (Cl_PlayStructure) and that each play's title is given with the property :playTitle while its number of acts is provided via the property :numberOfActs, the following SPARQL query extracts the number of acts for a particular play (e.g., “Merchant of Venice”):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?playTitle ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_PlayStructure ;
        :playTitle ?playTitle ;
        :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
  FILTER(STR(?playTitle) = "Merchant of Venice")
}

This query shows that the competency question “How many acts does a particular play contain?” can be answered with the ontology as modeled.
