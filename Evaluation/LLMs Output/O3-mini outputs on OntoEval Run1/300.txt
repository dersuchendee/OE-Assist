Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the number of acts recorded for each play in the ontology:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?numActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  ?play :numActs ?numActs .
}
