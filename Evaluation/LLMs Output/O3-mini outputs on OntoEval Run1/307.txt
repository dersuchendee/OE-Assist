**Yes**

We can extract the premier date(s) of a production by using the link between a production, its premier, and the premier’s date. For example, assuming that each production in the ontology has one premier (as modelled by the ProductionWithOnePremier restriction), one SPARQL query is:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a theatre:Production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
  ?production theatre:hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier theatre:hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query returns, for each production, the date of its premier. Under the closed world assumption all the information needed is asserted, so the CQ “When was the premier of a certain production?” is fully supported by the ontology.
