**Yes**

Assuming that productions are linked to their premier (or premier event) via the property :hasPremier and that the premier (or premier event) carries a :premierDate, a SPARQL query answerable under a closed world assumption would be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}

This query retrieves, for each production, the associated premierâ€™s date as required by the competency question.
