SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production ;
              :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
```

This query returns all productions along with the date of their premier, which directly answers the competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" under the closed world assumption.
