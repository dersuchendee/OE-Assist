**Yes**

Assuming a closed‐world interpretation, the production’s premiere information is explicitly stored via a property linking a production to its unique premiere (with a premiere date). For example, the ontology defines a production (of type Cl_Production) that has a premiere (via the :hasPremiere property) and the premiere has a date (using the :premiereDate property). Thus we can answer the CQ “When was the premier of a certain production?” with the following SPARQL query:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premiereDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremiere ?premiere .
  ?premiere :premiereDate ?premiereDate .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves, for each production in the ontology, the corresponding premiere date, providing an answer to the competency question.
