**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that answers the CQ “When was the premier of a certain production?” by retrieving each production along with its premier date:

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionName ?premierDateValue
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDateValue ?premierDateValue .
}
----------------------------------

This query assumes a closed world where each production has exactly one associated premier event (as required by the ontology restriction) and that premier dates are explicitly recorded using the data property :premierDateValue.
