**Yes**

We can answer this CQ by querying for participations that link an actor (via actorODP:participatingActor) to the process in which they participate (via actorODP:participationIn). For example, the following SPARQL query will retrieve, for each process in the network, the actors involved:

PREFIX actorODP: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actorODP/>
PREFIX actor: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actor/>
PREFIX process: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/process/>
PREFIX cvn: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/cvn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?process ?processLabel ?actor ?actorLabel
WHERE {
  { ?participation a actor:ProcessParticipation }
  UNION
  { ?participation a actor:CVNParticipation }
  .
  ?participation actorODP:participationIn ?process .
  ?participation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?process rdfs:label ?processLabel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?process ?actor

Under the closed-world assumption the query will return only those processâ€“actor participation instances explicitly represented in the ontology.
