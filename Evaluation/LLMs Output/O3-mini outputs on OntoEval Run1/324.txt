**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that extracts the premier date for productions:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :premierDate ?premierDate .
  # Optional: add FILTER clauses to target a specific production if needed.
}
---------------------------------

In a closed world setting the absence of a premierDate for a production means that production would not be returned, satisfying the competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" by retrieving the premier dates associated with production instances in the ontology.
