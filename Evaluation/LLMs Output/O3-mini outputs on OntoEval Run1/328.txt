Below is one possible SPARQL query that extracts the “star rating” given by a newspaper for a production using the reified review rating construct:

-------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionName ?newspaper ?newspaperName ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_ReviewRating ;
          :hasStarRating ?starRating ;
          :concerns ?production ;
          :reviews ?newspaper .
  OPTIONAL { ?production :hasName ?productionName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?newspaper :hasName ?newspaperName . }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, we assume that the existing facts in the ontology fully capture the relationships. In the ontology, the reified individual such as ReviewRating_Il_Gazzettino_Merchant_of_Venice connects the newspaper (:Il_Gazzettino) to the production (:The_Merchant_of_Venice_Grand_Theatre) with the star rating as data. Therefore, the competency question “What is the ‘star rating’ given by a certain newspaper for a certain production?” is modeled and answerable via the query above.
