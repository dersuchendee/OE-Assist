**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the star rating given by a specific newspaper (for example, ns1:IlGazzettino) for a particular production (for example, ns1:MerchantOfVenice_GrandTheatre):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>

SELECT ?production ?newspaper ?starRating 
WHERE {
  ?review a ns1:Review ;
          ns1:reviewOf ?production ;
          ns1:publishedBy ?newspaper ;
          ns1:starRating ?starRating .
  
  # Filter for the specific newspaper and production
  FILTER(?newspaper = ns1:IlGazzettino && ?production = ns1:MerchantOfVenice_GrandTheatre)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question “What is the ‘star rating’ given by a certain newspaper for a certain production?” is answerable with the ontology.
