Below is one possible SPARQL query that returns the star rating a given newspaper gave for a given production:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?prodLabel ?newspaper ?newsLabel ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a theatre:Production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?prodLabel . }
  
  ?production theatre:hasReview ?review .
  ?review theatre:hasStarRating ?starRating .
  ?review theatre:publishedIn ?newspaper .
  OPTIONAL { ?newspaper rdfs:label ?newsLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?production ?newspaper
--------------------------------------------------

This query leverages the ontology’s available classes and properties – such as theatre:Production, theatre:hasReview, theatre:hasStarRating, and theatre:publishedIn – which support extracting the answer to the competency question under a closed world interpretation.
