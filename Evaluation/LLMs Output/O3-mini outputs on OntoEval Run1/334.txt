**Yes**

Assuming that (a) a production can be linked to its review via the property :hasReview, (b) that a review (an instance of :Cl_ProductionReview) carries the star‐rating via :hasStarRating, and (c) that there is a connection from the production to the newspaper that provided the review (via, for example, the property :hasNewspaper), the following SPARQL query retrieves the star rating given by a specified newspaper for a specified production. (In a closed‐world setting we assume that if the production is not linked to a review or a newspaper then no rating exists.)

Example SPARQL query:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production ;
              :hasReview ?review ;
              :hasNewspaper ?newspaper .
  ?review :hasStarRating ?starRating .
  # Filter to a certain production and newspaper
  FILTER(?production = :MerchantOfVenice)
  FILTER(?newspaper = :IlGazzettino)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the CQ “What is the ‘star rating’ given by a certain newspaper for a certain production?” by extracting the star rating for production :MerchantOfVenice as reviewed by newspaper :IlGazzettino.
