In this ontology the review class (with its starRating data property) is linked to a production through the :hasReview property, and each review is in turn linked to a newspaper via the :reviewedBy property. Therefore, the competency question “What is the ‘star rating’ given by a certain newspaper for a certain production?” is answerable assuming known identifiers for the newspaper and the production.

Below is an example SPARQL query:

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
  
  ?production :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :starRating ?starRating .
  ?review :reviewedBy ?newspaper .
  
  # Replace the following with the specific newspaper
  FILTER(?newspaper = :IlGazzettino)
}
----------------------------------

This query retrieves the production(s) along with their star ratings from the review made by the specified newspaper.
