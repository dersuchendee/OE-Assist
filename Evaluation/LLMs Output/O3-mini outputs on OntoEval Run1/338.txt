**Yes**

We can extract the “star rating” by joining a theatre production to its review, then “reviewedBy” to the newspaper, and finally returning its dp_starRating. For example, if you want the star rating that newspaper :IlGazzettino gave to production :MerchantOfVeniceProduction, you can use a query such as:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?newspaper ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_TheatreProduction .
  ?production :op_hasReview ?review .
  ?review :dp_starRating ?starRating .
  ?review :op_reviewedBy ?newspaper .
  FILTER(?production = :MerchantOfVeniceProduction && ?newspaper = :IlGazzettino)
}

This query answers the CQ under a closed‐world assumption, as all relevant individuals (production, review, and newspaper) are explicitly asserted in the ontology.
