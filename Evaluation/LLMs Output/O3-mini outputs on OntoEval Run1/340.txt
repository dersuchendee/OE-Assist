Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the star rating that a given newspaper assigned to a specific production:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?newspaper ?newspaperLabel ?rating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production ;
              rdfs:label ?productionLabel ;
              :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :starRating ?rating ;
          :reviewedBy ?newspaper .
  ?newspaper rdfs:label ?newspaperLabel .
  # Optionally restrict to a specific production and newspaper:
  # FILTER(?production = :Production_GrandTheatre_MerchantOfVenice && ?newspaper = :Newspaper_IlGazzettino)
}

This query extracts, for each production that has an associated review, the star rating given by the reviewing newspaper.
