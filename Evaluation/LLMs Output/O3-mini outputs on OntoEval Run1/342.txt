**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the newspaper (and optionally its name) that gave the Merchant of Venice production a star rating of 5:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?newspaper ?newspaperName ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_Review ;
          :hasProduction :Production_GrandTheatre_MerchantOfVenice ;
          :hasNewspaper ?newspaper ;
          :hasStarRating ?starRating .
  
  FILTER(?starRating = 5)
  
  OPTIONAL { 
    ?newspaper :newspaperName ?newspaperName .
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

With the closed world assumption, the query assumes that if a review does not have a statement for a given property (here :hasStarRating) then the fact is not true. This query shows that the production “The Merchant of Venice at The Grand Theatre” (instance :Production_GrandTheatre_MerchantOfVenice) received a review with a star rating of 5 from the newspaper linked via :hasNewspaper.
