**Yes**

Assuming that productions are linked to newspaper ratings using the property :ratedBy and that the rating value is stored via the data property :starRating on instances of :Cl_NewspaperRating, you can answer the CQ by writing a query such as:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
  
  ?production :ratedBy ?rating .
  ?rating a :Cl_NewspaperRating .
  ?rating :starRating ?starRating .

  # To restrict to a certain newspaper, assume the rating resource carries
  # a label that identifies the newspaper. Uncomment and set the value below if needed:
  # ?rating rdfs:label "Il Gazzettino" .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query extracts for each production the star rating given by a newspaper rating (from the reified class :Cl_NewspaperRating), so the CQ is modelled by the ontology under a closed‚Äêworld assumption.
