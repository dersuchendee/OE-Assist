**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given production and newspaper, the star rating. Note that under the closed‐world assumption any production–review linking is explicitly provided in the data.

 
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?newspaper ?production ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?newspaper a :Cl_Newspaper .
  ?newspaper :hasReview ?production .
  ?production a :Cl_NewspaperReview .
  ?production :starRating ?starRating .
  
  # Optionally, if you wish to filter for a particular production:
  # FILTER(?production = <http://www.example.org/test#YourProductionIRI>)
}
 
In this query the assumption is that a review (an instance of Cl_NewspaperReview) is both a production (since it is a subclass of Cl_Production) and a newspaper’s review, so the “star rating” data is accessible.
