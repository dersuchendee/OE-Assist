**Yes**

Assuming that the production and the newspaper in question are correctly identified in the ontology (using, for example, rdfs:label or known URIs), the CQ can be answered using the following SPARQL query under the closed‚Äêworld assumption:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?newspaper ?production ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?newspaper a :Cl_Newspaper .
  ?newspaper rdfs:label "Il Gazzettino" .        # adjust label/filter as needed
  
  ?newspaper :publishedReview ?review .
  
  ?review :reviews ?production .
  ?review :starRating ?starRating .
  
  ?production rdfs:label "Merchant of Venice" .    # adjust to the specific production if required
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the star rating given by the specified newspaper for the specified production; thus, the CQ is fully covered by the ontology.
