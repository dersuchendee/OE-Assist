**Yes**

Assuming that reviews are modelled in the ontology as reifications that are simultaneously instances of both Cl_Newspaper and Cl_Production (via the subclass Cl_NewspaperReview), we can extract the star rating given by a newspaper for a production. Under a closed‐world assumption, only the explicitly asserted triples are considered, so if a certain newspaper “hasReview” a review (which is also typed as a production) and that review has a starRating value, the following SPARQL query returns the answer:

-----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?newspaper ?production ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?newspaper a :Cl_Newspaper .
  ?newspaper :hasReview ?production .
  ?production a :Cl_NewspaperReview .
  ?production :starRating ?starRating .
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

In this query the variable ?production represents the review instance (which is also an instance of Cl_Production because of the reification) that carries the starRating given by the newspaper.
