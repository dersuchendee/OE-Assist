**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the employment start date for each actor along with the theatre where they work:

PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a theatre:Actor .
  ?actor theatre:hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment theatre:hasStartDate ?startDate .
  ?employment theatre:hasTheatre ?theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?actor

This query answers the competency question "At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?" by retrieving, for each actor, the associated employment start date and the theatre at which they are employed.
