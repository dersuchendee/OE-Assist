Below is a SPARQL query that uses the reified employment relationship (modeled as instances of Cl_ActorEmployment) to report the employment start date of a given actor at a given theatre:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?actorName ?theatreName ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment ;
              :employment_actor ?actor ;
              :employment_theatre ?theatre ;
              :employment_start_date ?startDate .
  ?actor rdfs:label ?actorName .
  ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreName .
  
  # Replace the following FILTER values with the desired actor and theatre names
  FILTER(?actorName = "Fabio Bianchi" && ?theatreName = "The Grand Theatre")
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the actor’s name, the theatre’s name, and the start date when the actor began working at the theatre.
