**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the start date on which a given actor started working for a given theatre. (Replace the placeholders "Fabio Bianchi" and "Specific Theatre" with the appropriate names as they are encoded in your data.)

SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?theatre ?theatreName ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Employment .
  ?employment :hasEmployee ?actor .
  ?actor rdfs:label ?actorName .
  
  ?employment :hasEmployer ?theatre .
  ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreName .
  
  ?employment :hasStartDate ?startDate .
  
  FILTER(?actorName = "Fabio Bianchi" && ?theatreName = "Specific Theatre")
}
------------------------------------------------------------

In this query, we assume that the ontology models employment relationships by the reified class :Employment, which links an Actor (via :hasEmployee) with a Theatre (via :hasEmployer) along with a start date provided over the property :hasStartDate. This makes the competency question answerable under the closed world assumption.
