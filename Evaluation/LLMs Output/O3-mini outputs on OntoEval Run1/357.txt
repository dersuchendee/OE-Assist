**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, given an actor and a theatre, retrieves the employment (start) date from the ontology:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?employmentDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment :hasEmploymentDate ?employmentDate .
  ?employment :isEmployedIn ?theatre .
  
  # Replace the following IRIs with the actual actor and theatre IRIs of interest:
  FILTER (?actor = <http://www.example.org/test#FabioBianchi> &&
          ?theatre = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificTheatre>)
}
ORDER BY ?employmentDate
--------------------------------------------------

This query is based on the ontology where the employment of an actor is modelled via the property :hasEmployment (with range :Cl_ActorEmployment), from which the start date can be extracted using :hasEmploymentDate, and the associated theatre is given by :isEmployedIn.
