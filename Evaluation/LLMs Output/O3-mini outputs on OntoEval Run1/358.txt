**Yes**

We can answer the CQ using the Cl_ActorEmployment class defined in the ontology. In this ontology a work relationship is reified by instances of Cl_ActorEmployment that link an actor (via the employedActor property) to a theatre (via the atTheatre property) and record the start date (via the startDate datatype property). In a closed world scenario we assume that if an actor’s employment is not asserted then it doesn’t exist.

Below is an example SPARQL query extracting, for each employment instance, the actor, the theatre, and the start date:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment ;
              :employedActor ?actor ;
              :atTheatre ?theatre ;
              :startDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?startDate
-------------------------------------------------

This query returns all employment records with their associated start dates, answering the CQ "At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?"
