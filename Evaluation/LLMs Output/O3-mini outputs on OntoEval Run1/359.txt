Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves the employment date (i.e. the start time) for an actor (represented by an instance of Cl_ActorEmployment) together with the theatre they work for:

SELECT ?actorEmployment ?actorName ?theatre ?theatreName ?employmentDate
WHERE {
  ?actorEmployment a :Cl_ActorEmployment ;
                   :hasEmploymentDate ?employmentDate ;
                   :worksForTheatre ?theatre ;
                   rdfs:label ?actorName .
  ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreName .
}
ORDER BY ?employmentDate
————————————————————————————————————————————

In this query we assume that an employment record (of type Cl_ActorEmployment) connects an actor (its label holds the actor’s name) to a theatre via the :worksForTheatre property and carries the starting date via the :hasEmploymentDate property.
