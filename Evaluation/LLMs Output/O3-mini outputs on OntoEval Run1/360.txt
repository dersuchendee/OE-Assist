**Yes**

Assuming a closed‐world interpretation, the ontology supports a query using the employment information to retrieve the employment start date of an actor with a given name at a specific theatre. For example, to know when Fabio Bianchi started working for The Grand Theatre, you could write a query like this:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Individual ;
         :hasName ?actorName ;
         :employedBy ?theatre ;
         :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
  
  FILTER(?actorName = "Fabio Bianchi")
  FILTER(?theatre = :TheGrandTheatre)
}
---------------------------------

This query retrieves the actor’s employment start date from the associated employment record, thus fully modeling the CQ.
