The ontology provides employment information via the “:employedAt” property linking an actor (of type :Cl_Actor) to an employment instance (of type :Cl_ActorEmployment), which in turn has the property “:employmentStartDate” and relates to a theatre using “:employmentTheatre”. This lets us determine when a given actor began working at a certain theatre.

For example, you could use the following SPARQL query to answer the CQ:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?theatre ?theatreName ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor ;
         :actorName ?actorName ;
         :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentTheatre ?theatre ;
              :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  ?theatre :theatreName ?theatreName .
  # Optionally filter for a specific actor or theatre:
  # FILTER(?actorName = "Fabio Bianchi") 
  # FILTER(?theatreName = "The Grand Theatre")
}
ORDER BY ?actorName

This query extracts, for each actor, the name of the actor, the associated theatre, and the employment start date, thereby answering the competency question under the closed world assumption.
