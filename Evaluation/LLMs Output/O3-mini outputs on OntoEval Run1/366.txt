**Yes**

Assuming that the employment of an actor at a theatre is captured via an employment record (i.e. an instance of the class Cl_ActorEmployment, which—by design—is also (reified as) a theatre and a date) and that the starting date is stored using the data property employmentStartDate, a SPARQL query to answer the CQ (“At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?”) can be written as follows:

SELECT ?actorName ?theatreName ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor ;
         :actorName ?actorName ;
         :employedAt ?employment .

  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment ;
              :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate ;
              a :Cl_Theatre ;       # since Cl_ActorEmployment is a subclass of Cl_Theatre
              :theatreName ?theatreName .
  
  # Here we use a FILTER to select a “certain actor” and a “specific theatre”
  FILTER(?actorName = "Fabio Bianchi" && ?theatreName = "The Grand Theatre")
}
ORDER BY ?employmentStartDate

This query extracts the actor’s name, the theatre name, and the employment starting date using the employment record linking the actor to the theatre under the closed world assumption.
