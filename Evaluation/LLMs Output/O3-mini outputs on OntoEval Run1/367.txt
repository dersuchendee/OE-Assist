**Yes**  
Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the employment start date for an actor working at a specific theatre. In this ontology the employment details are reified as instances of Cl_ActorEmployment (which, by design, is also a kind of Cl_Theatre and Cl_Date). The query assumes that the actor is linked via the “employedAt” property and that the employment instance carries an “employmentStartDate” property. You may filter by a given actor (e.g. :FabioBianchi) and theatre (e.g. :TheGrandTheatre) as needed.

SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment ;
              :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  # Under our modelling the employment instance is also considered an instance of the theatre.
  ?employment a :Cl_Theatre .
  
  # To restrict to a specific actor and theatre, you can add for example:
  # FILTER(?actor = :FabioBianchi && ?theatre = :TheGrandTheatre)
}
ORDER BY ?actor ?startDate

This query demonstrates that the CQ “At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?” is fully answerable using the ontology.
