**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the employment start date for an actor (e.g., “Fabio Bianchi”) working at a particular theatre (e.g., “The Grand Theatre”). This assumes that persons, theatres, and their employment start dates are explicitly asserted in the ontology:

------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :employedAt ?theatre ;
          :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel. }
  
  # Using filters to select the specific actor and theatre
  FILTER(regex(?personLabel, "Fabio Bianchi", "i"))
  FILTER(regex(?theatreLabel, "The Grand Theatre", "i"))
}
------------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, we assume that all necessary facts (such as the specific employment start date) are explicitly present in the ontology, so this CQ is fully answerable.
