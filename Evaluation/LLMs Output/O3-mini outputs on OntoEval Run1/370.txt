**Yes**

We can answer this CQ by retrieving the employment record that links the actor and the theatre and then fetch the employmentStartDate. Assuming that the ontology models:
• The theatre as instances of :Cl_Theatre,
• The employment relationship as instances of :Cl_Employment with a data property :employmentStartDate,
• The link from a theatre to its employment record via the object property :employs (with domain :Cl_Theatre and range :Cl_Employment),
• And the link from the employment record to the actor via the object property :employedActor (with range :Cl_Actor),

the following SPARQL query retrieves the employment start date for an actor working for a theatre. (Replace or bind the actor and theatre accordingly.)

SELECT ?theatre ?actor ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :employs ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  ?employment :employedActor ?actor .
  
  # Optionally, filter by a specific actor and theatre, e.g.:
  # FILTER(?actor = :Fabio_Bianchi)
  # FILTER(?theatre = :Grand_Theatre)
}
ORDER BY ?employmentStartDate

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question.
