**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the employment start date (i.e. the time the actor started working for the theatre) for a given actor and theatre. In this ontology the employment relationship is reified by the class Cl_Employment (which is a subclass of Cl_Actor, Cl_Theatre, and Cl_Date) and connected via the property :isEmployedAt. The data property :employmentStartDate of Cl_Employment provides the needed date.

For example, to retrieve the employment start date along with actor and theatre labels, you could use:

-----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?theatre ?theatreName ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorName . }
  
  ?actor :isEmployedAt ?employment .
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  
  # Because Cl_Employment is also a subclass of Cl_Theatre, we can get theatre info:
  ?employment a :Cl_Theatre .
  BIND(?employment AS ?theatre) .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreName . }
  
  # Optionally, to specify a given actor or theatre, add FILTER or VALUES clauses.
}
ORDER BY ?actor ?employmentStartDate
-----------------------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question 
  “At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?” 
is fully answerable via the ontology.
