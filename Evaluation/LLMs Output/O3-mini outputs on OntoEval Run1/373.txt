**Yes**
Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, returns the roles a specified person has in a specified production at a given point in time:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/theatre_ontology#>
PREFIX time: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?personName ?productionTitle ?role ?timeInstant
WHERE {
  # Identify the person with a known name (parameterize as needed)
  ?person a :Person ;
          :hasName ?personName ;
          :hasTimeIndexedRole ?tir .
  FILTER(?personName = "Fabio Bianchi"@en)
  
  # Get the underlying role for this time-indexed role
  ?tir :hasRole ?role .
  
  # The role must be linked to the production
  ?role :performedIn ?production .
  ?production :hasTitle ?productionTitle .
  FILTER(?productionTitle = "The Merchant of Venice"@en)
  
  # And the role is valid at a certain time instance
  ?tir :hasTime ?time .
  ?time time:inXSDDateTime ?timeInstant .
  FILTER(?timeInstant = "2009-09-07T20:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the name of the person, the title of the production, the role the person is playing (via the time-indexed role), and the time (as an xsd:dateTime) at which that role is held.
