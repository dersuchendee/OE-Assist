Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the roles assigned to a given person in a specific production at a specific time point. (In the query below, you would replace :targetPerson, :targetProduction, and :targetTimePoint with the actual URIs of the person, production, and time instance of interest.)

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?role ?roleLabel
WHERE {
  # Identify the given person and their role assignments
  :targetPerson a :Cl_Person ;
                :assignedRoleAssignment ?assignment .

  # Ensure that the assignment is connected to the specified production
  :targetProduction a :Cl_Production ;
                    :roleAssignmentInProduction ?assignment .

  # Ensure that the assignment corresponds to the specified time point
  :targetTimePoint a :Cl_TimePoint ;
                   :roleAssignmentAtTimePoint ?assignment .

  # Retrieve the role associated with the role assignment
  ?role :roleAssignmentOfRole ?assignment .
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel . }
}
----------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology models the competency question since it is possible to extract the answer using the defined reification structure (via Cl_RoleAssignment).
