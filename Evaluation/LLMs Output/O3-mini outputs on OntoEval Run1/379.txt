**No**
Because the ontology does not explicitly model temporal aspects of ensemble membership, we cannot fully answer “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” under a closed world assumption. We can only extract the members known to be associated with an ensemble, without being able to filter by a specific point in time.
