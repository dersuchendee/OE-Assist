**Yes**

Assuming that an actor’s role is represented by an instance of Cl_ActorRole (which is a subclass of Cl_Actor) that “has a role” (via the property :hasRole) in a play, and that a production is “based on” a play (via :isBasedOn), we can write a query that, for a given actor, production and point in time, retrieves the matching role assignment. Under the closed‐world assumption (only explicitly stated data is true), the following SPARQL query extracts the answer:

SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?play ?roleDate ?production

  # Parameters: replace these with the concrete IRIs or values for the given actor, production and date.

  BIND("2009-09-15"^^xsd:date AS ?pointInTime) .
  
  ?actor rdfs:label ?actorName .
  
  # An actor (who is also an instance of Cl_ActorRole) has a recorded role (linked to a play)
  ?actorRole a :Cl_ActorRole ;
             :hasRole ?play ;
             :hasRoleDate ?roleDate .
  # Since Cl_ActorRole is a subclass of Cl_Actor, we require that the role assigned is that of the given actor.
  FILTER(?actorRole = ?actor) .
  
  # The production must be based on the same play that the actor’s role references.
  ?production :isBasedOn ?play .
  
  # The role date should match the specified point in time.
  FILTER(?roleDate = ?pointInTime)
}
ORDER BY ?actor ?roleDate

This query answers the CQ “What roles does a certain person have within a certain production at a certain point in time?” by retrieving for the given actor (person) and production all roles (via their underlying play) that are recorded on the specified date.
