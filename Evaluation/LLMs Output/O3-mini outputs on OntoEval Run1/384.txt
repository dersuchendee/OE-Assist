**No**

The ontology models role assignments for individuals (using classes such as Cl_Individual, Cl_Role, and Cl_RoleAssignment) and even the temporal information of those assignments (via the property atTime or assignmentDate), but it does not tie the roles or role assignments explicitly to a production (i.e. there is no relation linking a role assignment or an individual’s role to an instance of Cl_Production). Therefore, while we can retrieve the roles a person has and when those assignments occur, we cannot with certainty constrain those roles “within a certain production.”

A partial answer can be extracted with a query such as:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?role ?assignmentDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Individual .
  ?person :hasRoleAssignment ?assignment .
  ?assignment :assignmentDate ?assignmentDate .
  ?assignment :roleOf ?role .
  FILTER (?person = :FabioBianchi)   # restrict to the person in question, for example
}
------------------------------------------------

This query returns the roles assigned to the individual (e.g. FabioBianchi) and the date of assignment, but it does not check whether these roles pertain to a specific production.
