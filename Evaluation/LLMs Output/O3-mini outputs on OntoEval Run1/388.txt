**Yes**

The production ontology models roles through the use of a reification class for actor roles (e.g. Cl_ActorRole) and properties that link an actor, a role, a production, and a time period. For instance, an actor role instance connects an actor (Cl_Actor) via :hasRole to a role (Cl_Role), indicates in which production the role is played via :roleInProduction, and the associated time period via :roleTimePeriod. Based on this modeling, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the roles that a given person has within a particular production at a specific time. For example, to retrieve the roles for “Fabio Bianchi” in “The Merchant of Venice at The Grand Theatre” during “September 2009”, the query would be as follows:

WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor ;
         :actorName ?actorName .
         
  ?actorRole a :Cl_ActorRole ;
             :roleInProduction ?production ;
             :hasRole ?role ;
             :roleTimePeriod ?timePeriod ;
             ?rel ?actor .  # Alternatively, if the actor is linked to the role explicitly via the role reification  

  ?role a :Cl_Role ;
        :roleName ?roleName .

  ?production a :Cl_Production ;
              :productionName ?productionName .
              
  ?timePeriod a :Cl_TimePeriod ;
              :timePeriod ?timePeriodValue .
              
  # Filtering for the specified parameters:
  FILTER(?actorName = "Fabio Bianchi")
  FILTER(?productionName = "The Merchant of Venice at The Grand Theatre")
  FILTER(?timePeriodValue = "September 2009")
}
ORDER BY ?actorName ?productionName ?timePeriodValue ?roleName

This query shows that the ontology fully supports the competency question "What roles does a certain person have within a certain production at a certain point in time?" under the closed world assumption.
