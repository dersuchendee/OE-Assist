**Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?production (COUNT(?premier) AS ?premierCount)
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production :hasPremierEvent ?premier . }
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (?premierCount = 1)
```

This query returns all productions that have exactly one premier event, thus verifying the competency question under the closed world assumption.
