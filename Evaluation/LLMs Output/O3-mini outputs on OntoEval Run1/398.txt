**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves each production along with its (unique) premier event date by verifying that exactly one premier event is attached:

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate (COUNT(?premierEvent) AS ?numPremiers)
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremierEvent ?premierEvent .
  ?premierEvent :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
GROUP BY ?production ?premierDate
HAVING (COUNT(?premierEvent) = 1)
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query uses the closed world assumption to only return productions that have exactly one premier event, which directly reflects the competency question “A production has exactly one premier.”
