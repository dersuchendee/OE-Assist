**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, returns productions that have exactly one associated premier:

PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?premier
WHERE {
  ?production a ns1:Production .
  ?production ns1:hasPremier ?premier .
}
GROUP BY ?production ?premier
HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)

This query shows that for each production there is exactly one associated premier (i.e. the cardinality constraint is satisfied), so the competency question is fully answerable by the ontology.
