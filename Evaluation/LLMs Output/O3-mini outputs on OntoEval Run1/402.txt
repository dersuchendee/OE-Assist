**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves all theatre productions that have exactly one premiere:

-------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production (COUNT(?premiere) AS ?numPremieres)
WHERE {
  ?production a :TheatreProduction .
  OPTIONAL { ?production :hasPremiere ?premiere . }
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premiere) = 1)
-------------------------------------

In a closed world scenario, this query confirms that each retrieved production has exactly one premiere, matching the CQ "A production has exactly one premier."
