Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves productions that have exactly one associated production premier:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production (COUNT(?premier) AS ?numPremiers)
WHERE {
  ?premier a :Cl_ProductionPremier .
  ?premier :premierOf ?production .
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)

This query identifies each instance of a production (linked as the object of the property :premierOf from a production premier event) that has exactly one premier event.
