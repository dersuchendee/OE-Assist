**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves each production along with its single premier date (using aggregation to ensure that exactly one premier is recorded):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?production (GROUP_CONCAT(?date; separator=",") AS ?premierDate)
           (COUNT(?date) AS ?numPremiers)
    WHERE {
      ?production a :Cl_Production ;
                  :premierDate ?date .
    }
    GROUP BY ?production
    HAVING (?numPremiers = 1)
  }
}

This query confirms that each production (an instance of :Cl_Production) has exactly one premier date and extracts that value.
