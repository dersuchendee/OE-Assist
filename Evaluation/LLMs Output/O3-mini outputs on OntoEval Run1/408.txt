**Yes**

Under the closed‚Äêworld assumption we can assume that any production not having a premier is seen as having no premier, and since the premier date property is functional (i.e. at most one value), we can use a query that selects productions with exactly one associated premier date. For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production (SAMPLE(?premier) AS ?premierDate)
WHERE {
  ?production rdf:type :Cl_TheatreProduction .
  OPTIONAL { ?production :dp_premierDate ?premier. }
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)

This query returns all productions that have exactly one premier date, thereby modeling the competency question "A production has exactly one premier."
