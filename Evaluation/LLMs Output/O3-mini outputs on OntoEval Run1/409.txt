**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, returns productions that have exactly one premier:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production (COUNT(?premier) AS ?premierCount)
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production :hasPremier ?premier . }
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (?premierCount = 1)

This query checks that each production has exactly one associated premier event, thus supporting the CQ.
