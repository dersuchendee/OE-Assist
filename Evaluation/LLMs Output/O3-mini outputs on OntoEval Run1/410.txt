**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, checks that every production has exactly one premier by grouping each production’s premiership entries and ensuring the count equals 1:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production (COUNT(?premiere) AS ?premiereCount)
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremiere ?premiere .
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premiere) = 1)

This query will return only those productions that have exactly one associated premier, which models the competency question “A production has exactly one premier.”
