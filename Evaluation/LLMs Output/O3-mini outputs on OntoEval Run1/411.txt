**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for every production, its unique premier along with the premierâ€™s date:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premier ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the answer to the competency question "A production has exactly one premier" by finding each production and its associated premier (and premier date) as defined in the ontology under the closed world assumption.
