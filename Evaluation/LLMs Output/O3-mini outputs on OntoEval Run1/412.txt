**Yes**

One way to check that every production (instances of :Cl_Production) has exactly one premier is to query for, for each production, its associated premier (an instance of :Cl_ProductionPremier) via the property :hasPremier (whose range has been restricted to exactly one in the ontology) and retrieve its premier date. For example:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier a :Cl_ProductionPremier .
  ?premier :hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
}
---------------------------------

Under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, if the data is complete then every production has exactly one premier and this query will return, for each production, its unique premier date.
