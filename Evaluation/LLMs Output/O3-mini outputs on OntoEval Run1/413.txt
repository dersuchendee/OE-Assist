**Yes**  
Below is one suitable SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves every production that has exactly one premier:

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?production ?premier
WHERE {
  ?production rdf:type :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query checks that for each production there is one—and only one—premier recorded, thus supporting the competency question "A production has exactly one premier."
