**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, returns productions along with their (exactly one) premier date:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premier
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
}
GROUP BY ?production ?premier
HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)
-------------------------------------------------

This query lists each production and its unique premier date, ensuring that every production returned has exactly one premier as required by the CQ.
