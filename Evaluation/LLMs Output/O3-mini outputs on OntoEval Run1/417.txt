**Yes**

The following SPARQL query retrieves all productions that have exactly one premier date (using the :premierDate property of production instances of class :Cl_Production). In a closed‐world setting, we assume that if a production has no recorded premier date then the data is complete (i.e. the absence of :premierDate indicates there is no premier) and if the property is present it is unique (as declared by the ontology’s functional property).

SELECT ?production ?premierDate

HAVING (COUNT(?premierDate) = 1)

This query answers the competency question "A production has exactly one premier" by extracting, for each production, its (unique) premier date.
