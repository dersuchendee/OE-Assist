**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, returns productions that have exactly one premier along with its premier date:

----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production (SAMPLE(?premierDate) AS ?premierDate)
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)
ORDER BY ?production
----------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
• The query selects all instances of :Cl_Production.
• It retrieves the associated production premier via the :hasPremier property and its premier date.
• Grouping by ?production and using HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1) ensures that only productions with exactly one premier are returned.
• Under the closed-world assumption, we assume that the available data is complete, so this query fully answers the CQ.
