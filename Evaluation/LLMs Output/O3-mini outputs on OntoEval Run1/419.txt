**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, assuming individuals are asserted as instances of :Cl_Person and the relationship is modeled via the property :playsInstrument (or via the reification class :Cl_InstrumentPlaying), retrieves for a given person the instruments they play:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?personName ?instrument ?instrumentName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person :hasName ?personName . }
  
  # Either the person plays an instrument directly...
  {
    ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  }
  # ...or the relation is reified as an instance of :Cl_InstrumentPlaying
  UNION {
    ?action a :Cl_InstrumentPlaying .
    ?action ?p ?instrument .
    FILTER(?p = :playsInstrument)
    FILTER(?action = ?person)
  }
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentName . }
} 

This query extracts the instruments played by each person (using a known reification strategy, if available) under the closed world assumption.
