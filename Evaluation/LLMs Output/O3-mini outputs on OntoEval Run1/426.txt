Below is a SPARQL query that will extract a partial answer by retrieving the instruments a given person plays using the direct properties (i.e. via :plays and :playsInstrument), even though the relationship is not reified with a dedicated membership class:

SELECT DISTINCT ?instrument ?instrumentName
WHERE {
  # Select the specific person by name (adjust the literal as needed)
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :name "Flea" .

  {
    ?person :plays ?instrument .
    OPTIONAL { ?instrument :instrumentName ?instrumentName . }
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?person a :Cl_Instrumentalist ;
            :playsInstrument ?instrument .
    OPTIONAL { ?instrument :instrumentName ?instrumentName . }
  }
}
────────────────────────────────────────────

In this ontology, the relationship between a person and the instrument they play is modeled by direct object properties (:plays or :playsInstrument) rather than by a reified intermediary (such as a Cl_Membership). Thus, while we can extract the instruments played using the query above, the CQ is only partially supported from the perspective of reification.
