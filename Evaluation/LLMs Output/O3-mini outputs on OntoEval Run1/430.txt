**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, selects the instruments played by a specified person (here using a person IRI parameter, for example :Flea):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?instrument ?instrumentLabel
WHERE {
  ?person rdf:type :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }
  FILTER (?person = :Flea)  # Replace :Flea with another individual if needed
}

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports the competency question by allowing retrieval of instruments played by a given person.
