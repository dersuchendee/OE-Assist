**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption (i.e. assuming the ontology contains complete information about which instruments each person plays), retrieves the instruments a specified person plays. (In this example, we filter for a person—for instance, “:Anthony_Kiedis”—but you can replace that with any individual of :Cl_Person.)

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?instrument
WHERE {
  :Anthony_Kiedis a :Cl_Person .
  :Anthony_Kiedis :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}
---------------------------------

This query returns all instruments associated with the given person via the :playsInstrument property, showing that the competency question is fully supported by the ontology.
