**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for each performance its date and its associated geographic location (city, region, and country):

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?city ?region ?country 
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate ;
               :performanceLocation ?city .
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :locatedInRegion ?region . }
  OPTIONAL { ?region :locatedInCountry ?country . }
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate

In this query the ontology’s classes and properties (such as :Cl_Performance, :performanceDate, :performanceLocation, :Cl_City, :locatedInRegion, and :locatedInCountry) are used to extract the geographic information for each performance. This demonstrates that the competency question (i.e. “What is/are the geographic location(s) of each performance?”) is modeled by the ontology.
