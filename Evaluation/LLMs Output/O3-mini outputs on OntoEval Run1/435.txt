**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves all instruments played by a given person from the ontology:

─────────────────────────────

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?instrument ?instrumentLabel
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?person ?instrument

─────────────────────────────

In this query the property :playsInstrument connects a person (of type :Cl_Person) to what is deemed a “person instrument” (which, by subclassing :Cl_Instrument, represents the instruments played). Under the closed world assumption, we assume that any instrument not explicitly linked via :playsInstrument is not played by that person.
