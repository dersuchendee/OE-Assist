**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that extracts, for any given person, which instruments they play:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person rdf:type :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}

This query answers the CQ “What instruments does a certain person play?” by retrieving all persons of type Cl_Person along with the instruments that they play according to the :playsInstrument property.
