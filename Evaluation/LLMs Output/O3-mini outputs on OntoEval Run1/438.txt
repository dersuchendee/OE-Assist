**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given person, the instruments that person plays:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person rdf:type :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  # Replace <http://www.example.org/test#GivenPerson> with the URI of the person you are interested in
  FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#GivenPerson>)
}
--------------------------------------------------

Because the ontology explicitly provides the object property :playsInstrument (with domain :Cl_Person and range :Cl_Instrument), this CQ can be fully answered by the ontology. Under the closed world assumption, only those instruments that have been explicitly asserted for a person will be retrieved.
