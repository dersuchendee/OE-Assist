**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves for a given band and time point those persons whose membership started before (or on) the given time and (if specified) ended after that time.

(Here we assume that if a membershipEnd is not provided then the membership is still active.)

For instance, for the band “Red Hot Chili Peppers” at date “2005-01-01”, the query is:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?bandName ?person ?role ?start ?end
WHERE {
  BIND(:RedHotChiliPeppers AS ?band).
  BIND("2005-01-01"^^xsd:date AS ?pointInTime).

  ?band :hasName ?bandName .

  ?person a :Cl_Person;
          :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :hasMembership ?band;
              :membershipStart ?start;
              :hasRole ?role .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?end. }

  FILTER(?pointInTime >= ?start && ( !bound(?end) || ?pointInTime <= ?end ))
}
ORDER BY ?person
--------------------------------------------------

This query models the competency question “What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?” by retrieving all persons (with their roles and membership period) who are members of the specified band and whose membership period covers the given time point.
