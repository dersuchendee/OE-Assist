**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a band (here using ns1:RedHotChiliPeppers as an example) and a particular time (?queryTime), retrieves the persons (members) whose band memberships include that time:

PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?member ?memberName ?role ?beginDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  # Find persons with an associated membership
  ?member a ns1:Person ;
          rdfs:label ?memberName ;
          ns1:hasMembership ?membership ;
          ns1:hasRole ?role .
          
  # The membership is reified as a BandMembership and connected to the band 
  ?membership ns1:membershipInBand ns1:RedHotChiliPeppers ;
              ns1:memberDuring ?timeInterval .
              
  # Each time interval has a begin and an end date
  ?timeInterval ns1:hasBeginDate ?beginDate ;
                ns1:hasEndDate ?endDate .

  # Filter to include only those memberships valid at the given point in time
  FILTER(
      xsd:date(?queryTime) >= ?beginDate &&
      xsd:date(?queryTime) <= ?endDate
  )
}
ORDER BY ?memberName

# To use the query, bind the variable ?queryTime to the desired date (for example "2006-01-01"^^xsd:date) either via the query interface or using a VALUES clause.
  
This query shows that the CQ is supported by the ontology since the reified membership (ns1:BandMembership with the time interval via ns1:memberDuring) captures the necessary temporal information for determining membership at a specific point in time.
