**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world interpretation, retrieves the band members for a given band at a specific point in time. In this example we assume that the band is “Red Hot Chili Peppers” and that the desired time period is indicated by a TimePeriod (for example with label “2004”). You can adjust the values (or use parameters) as needed.

SELECT ?member ?memberLabel

  ?lineUp a :LineUp ;
          :partOfBand :RedHotChiliPeppers ;       # selects the desired band
          :activeDuring ?timePeriod ;              # the time period when the lineup was active
          :hasMember ?member .
  ?timePeriod rdfs:label "2004" .                   # filters to the specific point in time
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel } .
}

In this ontology the reified class LineUp connects a band (via :partOfBand), its members (via :hasMember), and the period when that lineup was active (via :activeDuring). Therefore the competency question “What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?” is indeed modelled by the ontology.
