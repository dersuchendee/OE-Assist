**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, returns the members of a given band (e.g., “Red Hot Chili Peppers”) who held membership at a specific point in time. In this example the query uses a parameter date (here “2004-09-01”) that you can change as needed.

SELECT ?band ?bandName ?member ?memberName ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?band a :Cl_Band .
  OPTIONAL { ?band :bandName ?bandName . }
  
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership ;
              :memberOf ?band ;
              :member ?member ;
              :startDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :endDate ?endDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?member :name ?memberName . }

  # Apply the closed-world condition:
  # A member’s membership is valid at the given date if:
  #   - its startDate is on or before the target date AND
  #   - either there is no endDate recorded or the target date is on or before the endDate.
  FILTER(
      xsd:date(?startDate) <= xsd:date("2004-09-01"^^xsd:date)
      &&
      (
         !bound(?endDate)
         ||
         xsd:date("2004-09-01"^^xsd:date) <= xsd:date(?endDate)
      )
  )

  # Example: select the band Red Hot Chili Peppers.
  FILTER (?bandName = "Red Hot Chili Peppers")
}
ORDER BY ?memberName

This query is answerable by the ontology because the reified membership information in class Cl_Membership (with properties :startDate and :endDate) allows us to check which musicians were members of a band at a specific point in time.
