**Yes**

Assuming the ontology provides time‐bound information about a band membership via a reified class (here :Cl_BandMembership whose membership period is modeled using a time period resource with start and end properties), one may write a SPARQL query to extract the band members at a given point in time. For example, if we assume that a membership’s time period is modelled with properties (for instance, :startTime and :endTime) on the time period instance, one might write:

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personName ?membership ?start ?end
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOfBand ?membership .
  ?membership :bandMember ?band .
  ?membership :membershipPeriod ?period .
  ?period :startTime ?start .
  ?period :endTime ?end .
  
  # Filter by the given band URI and the desired time point (e.g., "2004-09-01T00:00:00")
  FILTER (?band = <http://www.example.org/test#RedHotChiliPeppers>) .
  FILTER ( "2004-09-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime >= ?start &&
           "2004-09-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime <= ?end ) .

  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personName }
}
ORDER BY ?start
--------------------------------

This query extracts all persons (members) who belong to a specific band (here assumed to be represented by <http://www.example.org/test#RedHotChiliPeppers>) and whose band membership period (with start and end times) covers the point in time "2004-09-01T00:00:00". 

Under the closed world assumption the absence of alternative membership information implies that these are the complete set of members at that date.
