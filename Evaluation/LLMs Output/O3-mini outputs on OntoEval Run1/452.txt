**Yes**

Below is one example of how you could query for the members of a given band at a particular point in time. In this example we assume that the band membership is reified by instances of the class Cl_BandMembership, that a given band “hasMember” such memberships, and that each membership has an associated time period (an instance of Cl_TimePeriod) with properties (for example, :startTime and :endTime) that let you determine whether a given datetime falls within that period. (Under a closed‐world assumption, only those membership records explicitly stated in the ontology would be returned.)

For example, if you want to know the members of the band identified by <http://www.example.org/test#RedHotChiliPeppers> as of September 1, 2004, you might write a query like the following:

────────────────────────────────────
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?member ?memberLabel ?startTime ?endTime
WHERE {
  # Get band memberships for the given band
  <http://www.example.org/test#RedHotChiliPeppers> :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership ;
              :memberOf ?member ;
              :membershipPeriod ?period .
              
  # Optional label for the member
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
  
  # Assume the time period is recorded with a start and an end time
  ?period :startTime ?startTime ;
          :endTime ?endTime .
  
  # Filter for memberships that are valid at the given time
  FILTER ( xsd:dateTime("2004-09-01T00:00:00") >= ?startTime &&
           xsd:dateTime("2004-09-01T00:00:00") <= ?endTime )
}
ORDER BY ?member
────────────────────────────────────

This query returns for the specified band the persons (members) whose membership periods include the point in time “2004-09-01T00:00:00.” (You can replace the band URI and time literal as needed.)
