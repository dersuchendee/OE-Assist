**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the band membership information for a given band and a given point in time. This query assumes that band memberships have been modeled by reified membership instances (of class Cl_BandMembership) with properties linking the membership to both the member (via :hasMember) and the band (via :membershipInBand) as well as the membership time (via :atTime). You can substitute the band IRI and the point in time (using an xsd:dateTime literal) as needed.

SELECT ?membership ?member ?time
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership ;
              :hasMember ?member ;
              :membershipInBand :Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers ;
              :atTime ?time .
  FILTER(?time = "1988-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime)
}

This query returns the membership instance, the member individual, and the time value for all memberships of the band “Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers” at the specific point in time "1988-01-01T00:00:00Z".
