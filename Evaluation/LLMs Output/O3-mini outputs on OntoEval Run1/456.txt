**Yes**
Below is one example SPARQL query that uses the reified membership information (via the Cl_Membership class) to return the band’s members that were “active” at a given point in time. In this example the band is hard‐coded as :RedHotChiliPeppers and the point in time is provided as a literal date (for example "2005-01-01"). You can parameterize these as needed.

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?member ?memberLabel ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership ;
              :memberOf :RedHotChiliPeppers ;
              :bandMembership ?member ;
              :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd . }
  
  # Check that the given point falls after the membership started 
  # and (if an end date is provided) before (or on) the membership end.
  FILTER (
    xsd:date("2005-01-01") >= ?membershipStart &&
    ( !bound(?membershipEnd) || xsd:date("2005-01-01") <= ?membershipEnd)
  )
  
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?member
----------------------------------

In this query the closed world assumption is used so that when no membershipEnd is provided we assume the membership is still in effect.
