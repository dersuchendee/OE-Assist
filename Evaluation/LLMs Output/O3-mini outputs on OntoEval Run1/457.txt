**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption implied by the ontology, retrieves each performance along with its geographic location details (city, region and country):

----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?city ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceLocation ?city .
  ?city :locatedInRegion ?region .
  ?region :locatedInCountry ?country .
}
ORDER BY ?performance
----------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology can answer a competency question regarding the geographic location of performances as described in the OS (story).
