**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, returns the members of a given band (for example, the RedHotChiliPeppers) at a given point in time. In this query we assume that a reified relationship (of type Cl_PersonRoleBandTime) connects a person to a band with an associated time. (In a closed‐world reading, only those individuals explicitly linked with a starting time before or equal to the query time are taken as “currently” members.)

For example, to retrieve the members of the RedHotChiliPeppers as of a chosen query time (say “2006-08-11T00:00:00”^^xsd:dateTime), you could write:

-----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personName ?role ?roleName ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_PersonRoleBandTime ;
              :hasBand :RedHotChiliPeppers ;
              :hasPerson ?person ;
              :hasRole ?role ;
              :hasTime ?membershipTime .
  # Under the closed world assumption, assume that a membership
  # is “active” if its associated time is before or at the query time.
  FILTER (?membershipTime <= "2006-08-11T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
  
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleName . }
}
-----------------------------------------------------

This query returns those persons (and their roles) who are recorded as members of the band with a membership time before or equal to the given query time. Adjust the band and time filters as needed for your competency question.
