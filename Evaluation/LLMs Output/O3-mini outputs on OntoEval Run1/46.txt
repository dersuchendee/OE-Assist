**Yes**

Below is one way to write a SPARQL query that retrieves for each competency which actors hold it. This query uses the two modeling patterns in the ontologyâ€”either an actor directly holds a competency via the property :hasCompetency or holds one indirectly via an intermediate :Cl_ActorCompetency instance (linked by :actorHasCompetency and then linked to the competency via :competencyOfActor):

----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?actor ?actorLabel ?competency ?competencyLabel
WHERE {
  {
    ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
    ?actor :hasCompetency ?competency .
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
    ?actor :actorHasCompetency ?actorCompetency .
    ?actorCompetency :competencyOfActor ?competency .
  }
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?competency rdfs:label ?competencyLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?actor ?competency
----------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, only actors explicitly connected to a competency (either directly or via an intermediate reification instance) are returned, thus fully supporting the competency question.
