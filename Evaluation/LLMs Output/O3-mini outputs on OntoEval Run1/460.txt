**Yes**  
Below is one example of a SPARQL query that returns, for a given band and a specified point in time, every person whose membership (represented via a reified membership instance) started before (or on) the given time and either has no end date or ended after that time.

Assuming that the ontology uses the class :Cl_Membership with properties :membershipBand, :membershipPerson, :membershipStartDate, and optionally :membershipEndDate, the following query shows how to answer the CQ. (Replace the band IRI and the point in time as needed.)

SELECT ?band ?person ?personLabel ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  # Bind your chosen band and point in time here:
  BIND(:RedHotChiliPeppers AS ?band) .
  BIND("2005-01-01"^^xsd:date AS ?pointInTime) .
  
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership ;
              :membershipBand ?band ;
              :membershipPerson ?person ;
              :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate. }
  
  # The membership is valid if it started on or before ?pointInTime 
  # and either does not have an end date or ends on/after ?pointInTime.
  FILTER( ?membershipStartDate <= ?pointInTime &&
          ( !bound(?membershipEndDate) || ?pointInTime <= ?membershipEndDate ) )
  
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?membershipStartDate
--------------------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the CQ is modelled by the ontology since we can extract the band members at a given time via the reified membership information under a closed world assumption.
