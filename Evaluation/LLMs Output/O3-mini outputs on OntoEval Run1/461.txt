**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that—under the closed‐world assumption—retrieves the persons (members) of a given band whose reified membership is valid at a specified point in time. (In the query you would replace the placeholders for the band and the time point as needed.)

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd

  # Assume we want the members of a specific band; here we bind the band URI or look it up by its label.
  ?band a :Cl_Band ;
        rdfs:label "The Red Hot Chili Peppers" .
        
  # Bind a specific point in time (change the date as appropriate for your query)
  BIND("2004-09-01"^^xsd:date AS ?givenTime) .
  
  # Find memberships of persons that are reified via :hasMembership and that link to the band via :membershipIn.
  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipIn ?band ;
              :membershipStart ?membershipStart ;
              :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd .
  
  # Select only those memberships active at ?givenTime.
  FILTER(?givenTime >= ?membershipStart && ?givenTime <= ?membershipEnd)
  
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?person

In this query the ontology’s reification of band membership (class :Cl_Membership with properties :hasMembership, :membershipIn, :membershipStart, and :membershipEnd) is used to answer the CQ “What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?”
