**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, returns the members of a given band for a particular date. In this query, you would supply the band identifier (?band) and the date of interest (?givenTime). The query finds persons who have a membership record (via :hasMembership) that links them to the band (using the :membershipIn property) and whose membership start and (if present) end dates bracket the given date.

SELECT DISTINCT ?member ?memberName ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?member a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberName . }
  
  ?member :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipIn ?band .
  
  ?membership :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd . }
  
  # The given time must be on or after the membership start,
  # and either the membership does not have an end date or it ends on or after the given time.
  FILTER (
       xsd:date(?membershipStart) <= xsd:date(?givenTime)
    && ( !bound(?membershipEnd) || xsd:date(?membershipEnd) >= xsd:date(?givenTime) )
  )
}

Replace ?band and ?givenTime (e.g., "2004-09-01"^^xsd:date) with your specific band and point in time.
