**Yes**

Assuming the ontology captures band memberships via a reified Cl_Membership (with properties for membershipStart, membershipEnd, and the link to a band through membershipInBand), we can answer this CQ. In a closed‚Äêworld perspective, we only consider stated membership start/end dates. For example, you could parameterize the query with a specific band (as ?band) and a specific point in time (as ?checkTime) as follows:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  
  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipInBand ?band .
  ?membership :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd. }
  
  # Here we filter for memberships active at the given point in time (?checkTime)
  FILTER(
      xsd:date(?membershipStart) <= ?checkTime &&
      ( !bound(?membershipEnd) || xsd:date(?membershipEnd) >= ?checkTime )
  )
  
  # You can restrict to a specific band by binding ?band to a given band IRI:
  # FILTER(?band = <http://www.example.org/test#RedHotChiliPeppers>)
}
ORDER BY ?person
---------------------------------

In this query you supply the value for ?checkTime (e.g., "2005-06-01"^^xsd:date) and optionally restrict ?band to the band of interest.
