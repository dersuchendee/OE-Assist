**Yes**

The CQ is answerable with the ontology. The ontology models band membership with temporal information via the reified membership (using ns1:hasMembership and ns1:memberDuring) while linking a person (who has a role via ns1:hasRole) to a band (via ns1:membershipInBand). Hence, given a person, a band, and a specific date, we can check if that date lies within the membership’s time interval and then retrieve the role of that person.

For example, assuming we supply the IRI for the person, the band, and a date (here “?inputTime”), the following SPARQL query returns the person’s role provided that the input time falls within the membership’s begin and end dates:

———————————————————————————————
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?role ?membership ?beginDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a ns1:Person ;
          ns1:hasRole ?role ;
          ns1:hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership ns1:membershipInBand ?band ;
              ns1:memberDuring ?interval .
  ?interval ns1:hasBeginDate ?beginDate ;
            ns1:hasEndDate ?endDate .
  
  # Replace the following IRIs and date literal with input parameters:
  FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#AnthonyKiedis>)
  FILTER(?band = <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#RedHotChiliPeppers>)
  FILTER("2005-01-01"^^xsd:date >= ?beginDate && "2005-01-01"^^xsd:date <= ?endDate)
}
ORDER BY ?person

This query uses the closed world assumption (i.e. only the stated knowledge is assumed) and retrieves the role of the given person in the specified band at the specified date.
