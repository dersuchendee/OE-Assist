Below is one possible SPARQL query that leverages the reified BandMembership class to extract the role (with its time interval) held by a given person in a given band at a specified time point. (In this query, replace the placeholders :SomePerson, :SomeBand, and the date literal with the desired parameters.)

SELECT ?personName ?bandName ?roleName ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :BandMembership ;
              :involvesMember :SomePerson ;      # Replace with the specific person
              :hasBand :SomeBand ;                # Replace with the specific band
              :hasRole ?role ;
              :hasTimeInterval ?ti .
  ?ti :startDate ?startDate ;
      :endDate ?endDate .
  :SomePerson :personName ?personName .
  :SomeBand :bandName ?bandName .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
  
  # Filter to check that the given time point (replace with desired date) falls within the time interval.
  FILTER ("2000-01-01"^^xsd:date >= ?startDate && "2000-01-01"^^xsd:date <= ?endDate)
}
ORDER BY ?startDate

This query demonstrates that the competency question is fully answerable from the ontology, under the closed world assumption.
