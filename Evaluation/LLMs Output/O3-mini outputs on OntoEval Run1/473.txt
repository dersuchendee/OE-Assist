**Yes**
Below is one example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the role a given person had in a given band at a specific point in time. (Here the query uses parameter values for a “certain person”, a “certain band”, and a time point that falls between the start and end dates of the membership.)

SELECT ?personName ?bandName ?roleName ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  # Assume the person and the band are given (replace :PersonX and :BandY with the actual IRIs)
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :name ?personName ;
          :memberOf :BandY ;
          :hasRole ?memberRole .
  
  # Get the band’s name (if available)
  :BandY :bandName ?bandName .

  # The membership role assigned to the person
  ?memberRole :roleName ?roleName ;
              :atTime ?timePeriod .

  # The reified time period for which the role is valid
  ?timePeriod :startDate ?startDate ;
              :endDate ?endDate .

  # Specify a given date (modify the date literal as needed)
  FILTER( "2005-06-01"^^xsd:date >= ?startDate && "2005-06-01"^^xsd:date <= ?endDate )
}
ORDER BY ?personName
───────────────────────────────────────────── 

In this query:
• The person is identified as having a role (through :hasRole leading to a reified membership role) and a membership to a band via :memberOf.
• The membership role carries a :roleName and is linked (via :atTime) to a time period with a start and an end date.
• The FILTER ensures that the provided date (here "2005-06-01") is within the valid interval.
Thus, the competency question “What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?” is answerable given the ontology.
