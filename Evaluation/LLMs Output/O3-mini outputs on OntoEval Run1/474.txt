Below is one example of a SPARQL query that answers the CQ. In this ontology the reified “band‐role” connects a person with a band, a role, and the time period during which that role applied. Under a closed world assumption (i.e. if no information is stated then nothing holds), the following query retrieves for each person the band role they have (which by inheritance is also a band membership) together with the corresponding role and time period.

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?bandRole ?role ?roleLabel ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  
  ?person :hasRoleInBand ?bandRole .
  ?bandRole a :Cl_BandRole .      # reified band role (which represents the membership + role + time period)
  
  ?bandRole :roleInBand ?role .
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel . }
  
  ?bandRole :rolePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
ORDER BY ?person ?timePeriod
----------------------------------

This query extracts the role that each person has in a given band at a given time period (as expressed by a Cl_BandRole instance).
