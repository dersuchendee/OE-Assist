**Yes**
Below is one example SPARQL query that, given a target time, retrieves for a given person in a given band the role they held at that time. (In the query below, replace :TargetPerson, :TargetBand, and the literal for ?targetTime with the desired values.)

  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :bandMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :memberOf ?band ;
              :hasRole ?role ;
              :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd . }
  
  # Only include results for the given person and band,
  # and such that the target time falls within the membership period.
  FILTER (
      ?person = :TargetPerson &&
      ?band = :TargetBand &&
      xsd:date("2004-01-01") >= ?membershipStart &&
      (
        !bound(?membershipEnd) ||
        xsd:date("2004-01-01") <= ?membershipEnd
      )
  )
}
ORDER BY ?membershipStart

This query assumes a closed‐world view (i.e. if no membershipEnd is provided, the membership is still current) and directly “reifies” the membership information in a dedicated class (here :Cl_BandMembership or analogous reified membership instance) so that we can filter roles by a given point in time.
