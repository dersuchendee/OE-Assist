We can answer the CQ using the reified participation information in the ontology. In this ontology actors involved in a CVN appear via participation relations (class actor:CVNParticipation) where the participation relates a CVN (through actorODP:participationIn) with an actor (through actorODP:participatingActor).

Assuming a closed world, the following SPARQL query retrieves each CVN along with its corresponding actors:

PREFIX cvn: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/cvn/>
PREFIX actor: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actor/>
PREFIX actorODP: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actorODP/>

SELECT ?cvn ?cvnLabel ?actor ?actorLabel
WHERE {
  ?participation a actor:CVNParticipation .
  ?participation actorODP:participationIn ?cvn .
  ?participation actorODP:participatingActor ?actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?cvn rdfs:label ?cvnLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}

This query extracts the actors that are involved in each CVN, fully supporting the competency question.
