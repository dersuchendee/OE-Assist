**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption (i.e. only the explicitly stated facts in the ontology are considered), retrieves information about performances along with their location hierarchy (city, region and country). This query answers the competency question “Which performances took place where (i.e. what are the locations of performances and what is their hierarchical relation)?” by using the properties defined in the ontology.

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?city ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate ;
               :performanceLocation ?city .
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City ;
        :locatedInRegion ?region .
  ?region rdf:type :Cl_Region ;
          :locatedInCountry ?country .
  ?country rdf:type :Cl_Country .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports the CQ by providing an answer based on the reified structure of performance locations.
