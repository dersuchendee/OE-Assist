**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that answers the CQ “What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?” using the reified relationship modeling in the ontology:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?time
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_PersonRoleBandTime ;
              :hasPerson ?person ;
              :hasBand ?band ;
              :hasRole ?role ;
              :hasTime ?time .
  # Example: Retrieve the role of JohnFrusciante in the RedHotChiliPeppers at the time "1988-01-01T00:00:00"
  FILTER(?person = :JohnFrusciante && ?band = :RedHotChiliPeppers && ?time = "1988-01-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology reifies the relationship (by means of a class that is a subclass of Cl_PersonRoleBandTime) connecting a person, a role, and a band at a specific time—thus fully supporting the competency question.
