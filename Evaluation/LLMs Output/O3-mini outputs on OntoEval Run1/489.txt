**Yes**

We can answer the CQ “During what time period was a certain album recorded?” by retrieving the recording start and end dates from instances of Cl_AlbumRecording. Under the closed world assumption, if an album has been recorded, there should be recording dates associated with it. For example, to get these details (optionally for a specific album), one can write the following SPARQL query:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_AlbumRecording ;
         :dp_recordingStartDate ?recordingStart ;
         :dp_recordingEndDate ?recordingEnd .
  # To restrict to a specific album, uncomment and adjust the filter below:
  # FILTER(?album = :ind_StadiumArcadiumRecording)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the album recording instance along with its recording start and end dates, thereby answering the given competency question.
