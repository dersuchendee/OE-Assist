Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, extracts the recording time period for a specified album (e.g., "Stadium Arcadium"):

----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?recording ?timePeriod ?timePeriodLabel
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  
  ?album :albumOf ?recording .
  ?recording :recordedDuring ?timePeriod .
  OPTIONAL { ?timePeriod rdfs:label ?timePeriodLabel . }
  
  # Filter to a specific album; adjust or remove this filter as needed
  FILTER (regex(?albumLabel, "Stadium Arcadium", "i"))
}
----------------------------------------

In this query we start at an album, navigate via the :albumOf property to its recording, and then use the :recordedDuring property to obtain the associated time period. This fully answers the competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" within the ontology.
