Below is a SPARQL query that returns, for each album, the start and end date of its recording period:

SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd 
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :recorded ?recording .
  ?recording :recordingStart ?recordingStart ;
             :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
}
────────────────────────────

This query answers the competency question “During what time period was a certain album recorded?” by extracting the recording start and end dates from the ontology under the closed-world assumption.
