**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the recording time period (start and end dates) for an album:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :recordedDuring ?recording .
  ?recording :recordingStart ?recordingStart ;
             :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
} 

This query extracts the album(s) and its associated recording period as modelled in the ontology.
