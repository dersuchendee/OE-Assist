**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the album along with its recording date (using the :hasRecording and :recordedDuring properties):

—————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingTime
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :hasRecording ?recording .
  ?recording :recordedDuring ?recordingTime .
}
—————————————————————————————

This query returns the “time period” during which each album (e.g., “StadiumArcadium”) was recorded as modelled in the ontology.
