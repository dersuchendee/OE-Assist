Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the album recording start and end dates (i.e. the time period during which an album was recorded) for each album in the ontology. You may further filter by a specific album (e.g., by its label) if needed.

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel. }
  ?album :albumRecordingStartDate ?recordingStart .
  ?album :albumRecordingEndDate   ?recordingEnd .
}
ORDER BY ?album

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question “During what time period was a certain album recorded?” by directly linking albums (of type Cl_Album) to their recording start and end dates.
