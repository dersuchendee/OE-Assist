**Yes**

The ontology supports this competency question because an album (of type :Cl_Album) has an associated recording session (via the property :hasRecordingSession) that carries the start and finish dates (through :recordingStartDate and :recordingEndDate). Under a closed world assumption, you can query for a given album (or all albums) and extract the recording time period.

For example, the following SPARQL query extracts the recording time period for each album:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?recordingSession ?recordingStartDate ?recordingEndDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel. }
  ?album :hasRecordingSession ?recordingSession .
  ?recordingSession :recordingStartDate ?recordingStartDate .
  ?recordingSession :recordingEndDate ?recordingEndDate .
}
ORDER BY ?album

This query demonstrates that the competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" is answerable by the ontology.
