**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the recording start and end dates (the time period during which the album was recorded) for each album in the ontology:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :recordingStart ?recordingStart .
  ?album :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
}
ORDER BY ?album

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question by providing properties (recordingStart and recordingEnd) that capture the time period during which a given album was recorded.
