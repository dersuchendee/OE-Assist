**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that counts how many tracks a particular album (for example, one identified by its label "Stadium Arcadium") contains:

------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT (COUNT(?track) AS ?trackCount)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         rdfs:label "Stadium Arcadium" ;
         :hasTrack ?track .
}
------------------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question under the closed world assumption since it retrieves and counts all tracks explicitly linked to the indicated album.
