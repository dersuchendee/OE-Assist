**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for each album the number of tracks linked via the “containsTrack” property:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?trackCount)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology provides a direct connection from an album (an instance of :Cl_Album) to its tracks (instances linked via :containsTrack), so the competency question is answerable.
