**Yes**

Assuming the ontology’s music production model represents an album’s track count via either an asserted data property (e.g. :numberOfTracks) or via the reified relationship (∶containsTrack linking the album to its tracks), you can write a SPARQL query that extracts, for a given album, the number of tracks it contains. For example, if the ontology uses the data property, the query may be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?numTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :numberOfTracks ?numTracks .
}

If instead you want to compute the count from the membership of tracks via the object property, you could use:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?trackCount)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album

Both queries show that the CQ “How many tracks does a particular album contain?” is answerable from the ontology under a closed world assumption.
