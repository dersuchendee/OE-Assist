**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that extracts the number of tracks for each album:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?album ?numTracks
WHERE {
  ?album rdf:type :Cl_Album .
  ?album :numberOfTracks ?numTracks .
} 

This query directly retrieves, under a closed world assumption, the explicitly stated number of tracks for any album in the ontology, thereby answering the competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?"
