**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the complete number of tracks for the album “Stadium Arcadium”:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT (COUNT(?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  :Stadium_Arcadium a :Cl_Album .
  :Stadium_Arcadium :containsTrack ?track .
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This query works because the ontology explicitly states that “Stadium Arcadium” (an instance of Cl_Album) is connected via the property “containsTrack” to a set of track individuals (instances of Cl_Track). Under the closed‐world assumption the absence of other track assertions means that the count returned is the complete answer.
