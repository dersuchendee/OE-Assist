**Yes**

Below is a sample SPARQL query that retrieves, for every album in the ontology, the total number of tracks (using the declared :trackCount data property):

----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?trackCount
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :trackCount ?trackCount .
}
----------------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question “How many tracks does a particular album contain?” is answerable using the ontology provided.
