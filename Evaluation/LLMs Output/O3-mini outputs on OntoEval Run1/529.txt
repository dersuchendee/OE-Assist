**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the number of tracks for a particular album (e.g., “Stadium Arcadium”) by counting the tracks that are explicitly linked to the album via the property :albumContainsTrack:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         rdfs:label "Stadium Arcadium" ;
         :albumContainsTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album
--------------------------------------------------

This query confirms that the competency question “How many tracks does a particular album contain?” is answerable by the ontology.
