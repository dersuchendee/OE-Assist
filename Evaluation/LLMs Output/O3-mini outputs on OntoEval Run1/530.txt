**Yes**

Assuming that an album instance is connected to its recorded tracks through either a data property (:numberOfTracks) or via an object property (:containsTrack), the following SPARQL query retrieves the number of tracks for each album. Under the closed‐world assumption, if an album does not explicitly have a :numberOfTracks value, we count how many :containsTrack links exist.

For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel 
       (COALESCE(?storedCount, COUNT(?track)) AS ?tracksCount)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?album :numberOfTracks ?storedCount . }
  
  OPTIONAL { ?album :containsTrack ?track . }
}
GROUP BY ?album ?albumLabel ?storedCount
ORDER BY ?album

This query returns each album’s URI, its label (if available), and the number of tracks by using the stored count if available, otherwise counting the related tracks via the :containsTrack property.
