**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the release date for a specific album (e.g., “Stadium Arcadium”) from the ontology.

--------------------------------------------------

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :MusicAlbum ;
         rdfs:label ?label ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  FILTER(regex(?label, "^Stadium Arcadium$", "i"))
}

--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question “When was a certain album released?” is modelled by the ontology, as the album and its release date are explicitly represented and can be queried.
