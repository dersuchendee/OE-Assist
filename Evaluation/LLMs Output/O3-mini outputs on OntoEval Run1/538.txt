**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that answers the competency question “When was a certain album released?” by retrieving the release date of albums from the ontology:

---------------------------------
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a ns1:Album .
  ?album ns1:hasReleaseDate ?releaseDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
}
---------------------------------

This query lists all albums along with their labels and release dates, directly extracting the information encoded by the ns1:hasReleaseDate property from the ontology under the closed-world assumption.
