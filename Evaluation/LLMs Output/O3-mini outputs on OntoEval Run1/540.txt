**Yes**

Assuming that the album instances have associated release dates via the property release_date, we can extract the album’s release date with a query similar to the following. (Under the closed world assumption, if an album lacks a release_date triple then it is considered to have no release date.)

 
SPARQL Query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :release_date ?releaseDate .
}
ORDER BY ?album

This query retrieves all albums along with the date they were released, thus fully addressing the competency question "When was a certain album released?"
