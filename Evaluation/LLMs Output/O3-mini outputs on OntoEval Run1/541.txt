**Yes**

We can retrieve the release date of an album using the ontology’s :Album class and its associated :releaseDate and :albumTitle properties. For example, if we want the release date of “Stadium Arcadium,” a suitable SPARQL query is:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumTitle ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album ;
         :albumTitle ?albumTitle ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  FILTER(LCASE(?albumTitle) = "stadium arcadium")
}
------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption the ontology contains the necessary assertions so this CQ is fully answerable.
