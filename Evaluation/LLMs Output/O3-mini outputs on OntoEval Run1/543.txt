**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each album, its associated release date:

─────────────────────────────

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releasedAlbum ?albumRelease .
  ?albumRelease :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}

─────────────────────────────

Under the closed world assumption, only albums explicitly linked to a release date via the property :releasedAlbum and then :releaseDate will be returned. This query shows that the competency question “When was a certain album released?” is fully supported by the ontology.
