SELECT ?album ?releaseDate

  ?album :releasedOn ?albumRelease .
  ?albumRelease :releaseDate ?releaseDate .

```

In this ontology the film “album” is modelled as a :Cl_Album that is linked via the property :releasedOn to a release entity which in turn has a date defined via :releaseDate. Under a closed world assumption, a query like the one above will return the release date for any album—thus the competency question “When was a certain album released?” is answerable by the ontology.
