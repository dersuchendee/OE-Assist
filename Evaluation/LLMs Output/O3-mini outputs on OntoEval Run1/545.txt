**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the release date of a given album:

------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releasedOn ?albumRelease .
  ?albumRelease :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  # To get a specific album (for example "Stadium Arcadium"),
  # you might use a FILTER on a label or a known URI:
  # ?album rdfs:label "Stadium Arcadium" .
}
------------------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology models album releases (via :releasedOn and :releaseDate) so that the competency question "When was a certain album released?" can be answered by retrieving the release date of the album.
