**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves albums together with their release dates. In our ontology the class Cl_Album has a data property “releaseDate” (with range xsd:date) that is associated with album instances (e.g. :Stadium_Arcadium). Under the closed‐world assumption, only those albums with an explicitly given release date will be returned.

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album rdf:type :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}

This query answers the competency question “When was a certain album released?” by extracting the release date for all album individuals modeled in the ontology.
