**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the release date of a given album (here we assume the album of interest is represented by the individual :Stadium_Arcadium):

--------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  FILTER(?album = :Stadium_Arcadium)
}
--------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports the competency question “When was a certain album released?” by providing the release date for an album instance.
