**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the release date of a specific album (here, “StadiumArcadium”):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  FILTER(?album = :StadiumArcadium)
}
--------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption (i.e. only the facts explicitly provided in the ontology are considered true), this query answers the competency question “When was a certain album released?” by returning the release date for the album “StadiumArcadium” as recorded in the ontology.
