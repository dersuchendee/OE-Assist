**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves albums along with their release dates. (In the provided ontology the album (e.g., StadiumArcadium) is modelled as an individual of type :Cl_Album and its release date is given by data property :releaseDate.)

----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
ORDER BY ?album
----------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question "When was a certain album released?" is answerable in the ontology under the closed world assumption.
