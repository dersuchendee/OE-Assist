**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that answers the competency question “When was a certain album released?” by making use of the ontology’s ability to record an album’s release date via the :albumReleaseDate property on instances of :Cl_Album.

For example, assuming that the album of interest (e.g., “Stadium Arcadium”) is identified by its rdfs:label, you could write:

-----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  ?album :albumReleaseDate ?releaseDate .
  FILTER( ?albumLabel = "Stadium Arcadium" )
}
-----------------------------------------------

If no specific album is desired, you may simply list all albums and their release dates:

-----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  ?album :albumReleaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
-----------------------------------------------

Since the ontology includes the dataproperty :albumReleaseDate for albums, under the closed world assumption the competency question is fully answerable by this query.
