**Yes**

Assuming that album instances are created in the ontology and that the album release date is stored using the :releaseDate property on instances of :Cl_Album, you can retrieve the release date(s) with a query such as:

----------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
----------------------------

This query extracts the release date for each album in the ontology under the closed world assumption.
