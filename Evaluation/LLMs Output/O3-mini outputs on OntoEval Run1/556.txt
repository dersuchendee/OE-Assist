**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves albums and their release dates (thus answering “When was a certain album released?”):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query makes use of the ontology’s Cl_Album class and its associated data property :releaseDate to extract the answer.
