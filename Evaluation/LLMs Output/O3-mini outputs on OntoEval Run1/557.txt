**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves albums and their release dates by following the reification pattern used in the ontology:

-----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  ?album :releasedOn ?albumRelease .
  ?albumRelease :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
-----------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question "When was a certain album released?" by retrieving the album (optionally with a label) and its release date via the reified album release information.
