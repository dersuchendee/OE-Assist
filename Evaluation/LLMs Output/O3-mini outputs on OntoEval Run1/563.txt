**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the song a given track (a specific instance of Cl_Track) is a recording of using the ontology's isRecordingOf relation:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?track ?trackLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?track rdfs:label ?trackLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  # For a specific track, you can filter by its URI:
  # FILTER( ?track = <http://www.example.org/test#YourSpecificTrack> )
}
-------------------------------------------------

Using a closed-world assumption, only the explicitly stated facts in the ontology are retrieved. In this query, the track (of type Cl_Track) is linked to a song (of type Cl_Song) through the property :isRecordingOf, which exactly addresses the competency question "What song is a specific track a recording of?"
