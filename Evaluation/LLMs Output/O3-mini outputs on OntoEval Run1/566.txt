**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves the song a given track is a recording of (assuming the track is identified in the dataset):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?recording .
  ?recording :recordedSong ?song .
}
