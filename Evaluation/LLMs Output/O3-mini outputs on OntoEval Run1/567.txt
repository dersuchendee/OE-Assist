**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, using the properties in the ontology, retrieves for a given track the song associated to its recording:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track rdf:type :Cl_Track .
  ?track :recordingOf ?trackRecording .
  ?song :songRecorded ?trackRecording .
}

In this query the closed world assumption is applied so that only explicit assertions in the ontology are considered. The query extracts the song that a specific track is a recording of, showing that the CQ is answerable using the modelled ontology.
