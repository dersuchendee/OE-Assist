**Yes**

Assuming that “this material” is represented in the ontology as an instance of Cl_Material and that its associated composition is reified as an instance of Cl_MaterialComposition (which is linked to the material by the property :hasMaterial and further characterized by properties and provenance), we can write a SPARQL query that retrieves for each material its composition details. Under a closed world assumption, we expect that every material which participates in a composition is explicitly connected via a :hasMaterial triple.

For example:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?material ?materialName ?composition ?property ?propertyName ?provenance ?provenanceName
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Cl_MaterialComposition ;
               :hasMaterial ?material ;
               :hasProperty ?property ;
               :hasProvenance ?provenance .

  OPTIONAL { ?material :hasName ?materialName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?property :hasName ?propertyName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?provenance :hasName ?provenanceName . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query returns, for every material that is part of a material composition:
– The material (and its name, if available),
– The corresponding material composition instance,
– The property and provenance associated with that composition.

Thus the competency question “What is the composition of this material?” is fully answerable using the ontology.
