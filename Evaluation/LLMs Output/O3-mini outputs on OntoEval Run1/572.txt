**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves each performance’s location as well as the region (and country) in which that location is found:

—————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?location ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location :locatedInRegion ?region . }
  OPTIONAL { ?region :locatedInCountry ?country . }
}
—————————————————————

This query shows that the ontology models performances along with their geographical locations and regions, thus supporting the competency question.
