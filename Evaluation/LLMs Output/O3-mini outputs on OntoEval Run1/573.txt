**Yes**

Below is a sample SPARQL query that retrieves, for each track in the ontology (i.e. any individual of type Cl_Track), the song it is recorded of via the recordingOf property:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track rdf:type :Cl_Track .
  ?track :recordingOf ?song .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the competency question “What song is a specific track a recording of?” is answerable using the ontology.
