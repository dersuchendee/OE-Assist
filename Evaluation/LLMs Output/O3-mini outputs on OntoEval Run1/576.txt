**No**  
The ontology does not reify the relationship between a track and the song itâ€™s a recording of (i.e. there is no reified class linking them, such as a Cl_Record or similar intermediary), so only a partial answer (via the direct property) is possible. For example, you can extract the song for a given track as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track rdf:type :Cl_Track .
  ?track :trackOf ?song .
  # Optionally filter for a specific track:
  # FILTER(?track = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificTrack>)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the song associated with each track using the property :trackOf, but without a reified representation the answer is only partial compared to the intended reification approach.
