**Yes**

Assuming a specific track is known (e.g., identified as :SpecificTrack), the ontology provides an object property (isRecordingOf) linking a track (instance of Cl_Track) to a song (instance of Cl_Song). Under the closed world assumption, we can write the following SPARQL query to extract the song that a given track is a recording of:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  :SpecificTrack a :Cl_Track ;
                 :isRecordingOf ?song .
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}

Replace :SpecificTrack with the actual track identifier as needed.
