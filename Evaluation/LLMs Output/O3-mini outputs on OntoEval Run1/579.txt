**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the song associated with a given track (assumed to be provided as input):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?song .
  # To target a specific track, you can use a FILTER or bind the URI directly:
  # FILTER(?track = <http://www.example.org/test#YourSpecificTrack>)
}
  
This query shows that the CQ ("What song is a specific track a recording of?") is fully supported by the ontology because the ontology provides a connection from a track to a song via the property :isRecordingOf.
