**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a specific track of type Cl_Track, retrieves the song it is a recording of by following the reification properties:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track ;
         :isRecordingOf ?trackRecording .
  ?trackRecording :recordedSong ?song .
  # Optionally, filter for a specific track by its identifier or label:
  # FILTER(?track = <http://www.example.org/test#specificTrackURI>)
}

This query shows that the CQ “What song is a specific track a recording of?” is answerable using the ontology's reification pattern.
