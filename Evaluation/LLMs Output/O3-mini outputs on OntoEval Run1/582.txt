**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, given a song (or all songs), extracts the date on which it was composed:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?songLabel ?composedDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel. }
  ?song :composedOn ?composedDate .
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query directly retrieves the composition date for each song in the ontology, thereby satisfying the competency question "When was a certain song composed?" under the closed world assumption.
