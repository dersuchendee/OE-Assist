```sparql
SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Song ;
        :composedOn [ :hasCompositionDate ?compositionDate ] .
}
```

In this query we assume the ontology’s structure models a song’s composition date via the reified property (:composedOn) pointing to an individual (a :CompositionDate) that has the data property (:hasCompositionDate) with an xsd:date value. This allows us to retrieve when a certain song was composed.
