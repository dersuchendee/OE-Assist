**Yes**

Below is a sample SPARQL query that extracts, for each composition (the reified event of composing) the song and its composition date. You can further filter or parameterize the song of interest.

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?compositionDate 
WHERE {
  ?comp a :Cl_Composition ;
        :composition_song ?song ;
        :composition_date ?compositionDate .
}
ORDER BY ?song
---------------------------------

This query works under a closed world assumption by assuming that all instances of a songâ€™s composition are fully represented via the reified :Cl_Composition class.
