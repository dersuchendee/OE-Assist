**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the song’s composition date for a given song (here “Hump de Bump”), based on the ontology that includes a :Song class and a :compositionDate data property:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?songTitle ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Song ;
        :songTitle ?songTitle ;
        :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
  FILTER(LCASE(?songTitle) = LCASE("Hump de Bump"))
}
---------------------------------

This query verifies that the competency question “When was a certain song composed?” is answerable given the provided ontology.
