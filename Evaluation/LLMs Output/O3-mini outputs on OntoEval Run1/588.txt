**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that uses the ontology’s composition reification to extract the date on which a song was composed:

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?songName ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song :songName ?songName . }
  ?song :hasComposition ?composition .
  ?composition :composedOn ?compositionDate .
}
--------------------------------

In a closed‐world interpretation, if an individual song has been fully annotated (i.e. a composition exists and a composition date is provided via :composedOn), this query will return the composition date for that song.
