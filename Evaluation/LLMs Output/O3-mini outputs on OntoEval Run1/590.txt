**Yes**

One can answer “When was a certain song composed?” using the classes and properties defined in the ontology. For example, assuming that each song (an instance of :Cl_Song) is linked via the property :composedOn to a composition object (an instance of :Cl_SongComposition) which in turn has the date via the property :compositionDate, the following SPARQL query (using a closed world interpretation) returns the composition date for each song:

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :composedOn ?songComposition .
  ?songComposition :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves each song and its corresponding composition date, thus fully supporting the CQ.
