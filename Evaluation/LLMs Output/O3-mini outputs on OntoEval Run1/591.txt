**Yes**

We can extract the answer by finding songs and their associated composition events, which provide the composition date. For example, assuming that the song is linked to a composition instance via the property composedOn, here is a SPARQL query that answers the competency question:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?songLabel ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  ?song :composedOn ?composition .
  ?composition :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}

This query retrieves each song, its label (if available), and the corresponding composition date, thus answering the CQ "When was a certain song composed?" under the closed world assumption.
