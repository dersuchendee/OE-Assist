**Yes**

We can answer the CQ “When was a certain song composed?” by directly retrieving the composition date (using the :composedOn property) for songs in the ontology. For example, if we want to check the composition date of all songs (and then select the particular one of interest), a SPARQL query using a closed-world assumption can be written as follows:

———————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?composedOn
WHERE {
  ?song rdf:type :Cl_Song ;
        :composedOn ?composedOn .
}
ORDER BY ?song
———————————————

This query retrieves every song along with its composition date. For a “certain song,” you could add a FILTER or specify the song’s IRI (for example, if you know it’s :Hump_de_Bump).
