**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query retrieving the composition date of a song (e.g., Hump_de_Bump):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  :Hump_de_Bump a :Cl_Song ;
                :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}

This query shows that the ontology provides a class (Cl_Song) and a data property (:compositionDate) so that the competency question “When was a certain song composed?” can be answered for the song Hump_de_Bump.
