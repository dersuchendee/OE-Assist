Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each song, its composition date:

————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
————

This query extracts the information needed to answer the competency question “When was a certain song composed?” by retrieving the composition date of each song in the ontology.
