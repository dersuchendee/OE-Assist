**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the composition date for songs:
--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song ;
        :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query directly extracts the composition date (using the :compositionDate property) for all entities typed as :Cl_Song, which supports the competency question "When was a certain song composed?" under the closed world assumption.
