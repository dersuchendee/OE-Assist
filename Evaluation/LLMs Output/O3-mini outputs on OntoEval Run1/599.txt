**Yes**

Assuming you have a specific song (or will filter by its label/IRI), the ontology supports the CQ “When was a certain song composed?” because it defines a song class (:Cl_Song) with a data property (:composedOn) whose range is a date. With the closed‐world assumption, you can write a SPARQL query to extract each song’s composition date. For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?song ?songLabel ?composedOn
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  ?song :composedOn ?composedOn .
  # Optionally, add a FILTER to restrict to a certain song,
  # e.g., FILTER(?songLabel = "Hump de Bump")
}
ORDER BY ?songLabel
---------------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves each song’s composition date, thereby fully answering the CQ.
