**Yes**
Assuming that “a certain record” corresponds to an instance of Cl_Album and “a certain critic” to an instance of Cl_Critic, we can extract the critic’s review about that album using the reification properties (:reviewedBy, :hasCritic, and :hasReview). Under the closed-world assumption (i.e. only the asserted facts are considered true), the following query retrieves the album review written by a given critic.

Replace <ALBUM_URI> and <CRITIC_URI> with the appropriate URIs for the album and critic respectively.

This query demonstrates that the competency question is indeed modelled by the ontology.
