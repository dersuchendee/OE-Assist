**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the review content written by a specific critic (in this case "Crian Hiatt") about a specific record (here the album "Stadium Arcadium"):

PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?criticName ?albumTitle ?reviewContent
WHERE {
  ?review a :Review ;
          :reviewContent ?reviewContent ;
          :writtenBy ?critic ;
          :isReviewOf ?album .
  ?critic :criticName ?criticName .
  ?album :albumTitle ?albumTitle .
  FILTER(?criticName = "Crian Hiatt" && ?albumTitle = "Stadium Arcadium")
}

This query extracts the critic’s name, the album’s title, and the review content, thus modeling the competency question under a closed world assumption.
