**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the text (and date) of a review written by a given critic about a specific record. In this example we assume that the critic’s name and the record’s identifier (or label) are available.

For instance, if we want to know what review text critic “Crian Hiatt” provided about record “Stadium Arcadium,” the query could be written as follows:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?reviewText ?reviewDate
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_Review ;
          :reviewText ?reviewText ;
          :reviewDate ?reviewDate ;
          :givenBy ?critic ;
          :about ?record .
  ?critic :name ?criticName .
  ?record :albumName ?recordName .
  FILTER(?criticName = "Crian Hiatt" && ?recordName = "Stadium Arcadium")
}
------------------------------------------------

This query works because the ontology models reviews through the class Cl_Review and links reviews to critics (via :givenBy) and records (via :about). Thus, the competency question “What does a certain critic say about a certain record?” is fully answerable using the ontology.
