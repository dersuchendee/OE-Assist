**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the critic’s statement about a given record by “joining” the review, its critic, and the record:

--------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?critic ?record ?statement
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_CriticReview .
  ?review :madeByCritic ?critic .
  ?review :reviewOf ?record .
  ?review :criticStatement ?statement .
}
--------------------------------------------------------

In this query, the ontology models a “record” (as a member of Cl_Record) via its relationship (for example, through album tracks or reifications) and connects it to the critic’s review via the properties :reviewOf and :madeByCritic. Thus the competency question “What does a certain critic say about a certain record?” is fully supported by the ontology.
