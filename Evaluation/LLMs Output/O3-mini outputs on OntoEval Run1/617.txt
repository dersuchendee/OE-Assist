The ontology provides a direct link between a record (here modelled as an instance of Cl_Album) and its review (via the property reviewedBy) while the review is connected to a critic (modelled with Cl_Critic) through the madeBy property. Therefore you can write a SPARQL query to retrieve what a given critic says about a given record. For example, the following query extracts the album (record), the review statement, and the critic who made the review:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?critic ?statement
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :reviewedBy ?review .
  ?review :madeBy ?critic .
  ?review :statement ?statement .
  
  # Uncomment and adjust the following FILTERs to specify a certain critic and a certain record:
  # FILTER(?critic = :CrianHiatt)
  # FILTER(?album = :StadiumArcadium)
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question is fully answerable by the ontology.
