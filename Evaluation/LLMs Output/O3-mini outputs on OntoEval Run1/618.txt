**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the text of the review by a given critic for a specified record (album). In this query we assume that the critic of interest is :Crian_Hiatt and the record is :Stadium_Arcadium:

SELECT ?reviewText
WHERE {
  ?review rdf:type :Cl_Review ;
          :reviewedBy :Crian_Hiatt ;
          :reviewOf :Stadium_Arcadium ;
          :reviewText ?reviewText .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question “What does a certain critic say about a certain record?” since it directly retrieves the review text given the critic and the album.
