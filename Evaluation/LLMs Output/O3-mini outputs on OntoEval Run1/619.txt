**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the review text provided by a critic (e.g. CrianHiatt) for a given record (e.g. StadiumArcadium):

—————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?reviewText
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_Review ;
          :reviewedBy :CrianHiatt ;
          :reviewedRecord :StadiumArcadium ;
          :reviewText ?reviewText .
}
—————————————————————————————

This query shows that the ontology models the competency question “What does a certain critic say about a certain record?” because it allows us to extract the review text (the critic’s comment) for the specified record.
