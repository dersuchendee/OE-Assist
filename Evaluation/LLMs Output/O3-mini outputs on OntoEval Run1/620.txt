**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the criticâ€™s review text for a given record. In this query we assume that the critic and the record are provided (here using the individuals :CrianHiatt and :StadiumArcadium):

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?critic ?record ?reviewText 
WHERE {
  ?review rdf:type :Cl_CriticReview .
  ?review :reviewedBy ?critic .
  ?review :reviews ?record .
  ?review :reviewText ?reviewText .
  
  # If parameters are provided, e.g., for a specific critic and record:
  FILTER(?critic = :CrianHiatt && ?record = :StadiumArcadium)
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question by reifying the review as an instance of :Cl_CriticReview that links a critic (:CrianHiatt) and a record (:StadiumArcadium) with the property :reviewText.
