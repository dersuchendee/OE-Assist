**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the review content a given critic has written about a given record (here modeled as an album):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?record ?reviewContent
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Album .
  ?record :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :writtenBy ?critic .
  ?review :reviewContent ?reviewContent .
  
  # Replace the following IRIs with the actual IDs of the record and critic of interest:
  FILTER (?record = <http://www.example.org/test#TargetRecord> &&
          ?critic = <http://www.example.org/test#TargetCritic>)
}
------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “What does a certain critic say about a certain record?” since it directly retrieves the review content (i.e. what the critic says) by connecting the album (record) to its review and then to the critic.
