**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query. In our ontology the critic’s review is “reified” in an instance of Cl_CriticReview that (by design) plays the roles of both critic, record, and review text. Thus, given a particular record and a specific critic we can extract the review text. (Under a closed‐world assumption the absence of a matching review tells us that no review exists.)

Assuming that you have the IRIs for the record (<recordIRI>) and the critic (<criticIRI>), a query could be:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?reviewText
WHERE {
  <recordIRI> a :Cl_Record ;
               :reviewedBy ?critReview .
  ?critReview a :Cl_CriticReview ;
              :reviewText ?reviewText .
  # Here the same instance (the reified review) plays the role of critic.
  FILTER(?critReview = <criticIRI>)
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this query we retrieve the review text provided by the specified critic about the given record.
