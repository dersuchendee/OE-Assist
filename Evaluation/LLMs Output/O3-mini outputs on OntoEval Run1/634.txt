**Yes**

Assuming that performance events are modelled via the reified class (e.g., Cl_PerformanceEvent) with a date property (e.g., performanceDate), you could answer the CQ “When did a certain performance take place?” with a query such as:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performanceEvent ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performanceEvent a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?performanceEvent :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves each performance event and its associated date, thus fully addressing the competency question under a closed-world assumption.
