**Yes**

We can extract the answer because the ontology defines a performance class (:Cl_Performance) and a property (:performanceDate) that relates a performance to a date. Assuming a closed world (only explicitly stated dates are available), the following SPARQL query retrieves the performance instances along with the dates at which they took place.
