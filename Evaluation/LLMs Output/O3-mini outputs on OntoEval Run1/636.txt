**Yes**

Under a closed‐world assumption we can assume that performances are explicitly asserted (via the class :Cl_BandPerformance) along with their associated performance dates (via the property :performanceDate). Thus, the CQ “When did a certain performance take place?” is answerable by retrieving those entities.

A sample SPARQL query is:

---------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_BandPerformance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate
