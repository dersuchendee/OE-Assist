SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate

In this query we assume the closed world: performances are explicitly asserted with a performance date (e.g., the live performance of the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Portland). This answers the CQ “When did a certain performance take place?” by retrieving the performance individuals along with their performance dates.
