**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, given a specific resource (for example, :GlassBottle), retrieves its explicit type(s) as declared by the ontology. Under a closed world assumption only the asserted (and inferable) types are returned.

--------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology/recycling#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?resource ?type
WHERE {
  VALUES ?resource { :GlassBottle }  # Replace with the specific resource of interest
  ?resource rdf:type ?type .
}
--------------------------------------------

This query directly extracts the type(s) (i.e. the rdf:type assertions) of the resource from the ontology, fulfilling the competency question.
