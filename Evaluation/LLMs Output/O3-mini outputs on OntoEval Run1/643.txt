**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the performance and its performance date (the answer to “When did a certain performance take place?”):

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
--------------------------------------------------

In the ontology, the class Cl_Performance and the data property performanceDate ensure that we can extract the date when a performance (e.g., the Portland performance in the story) took place.
