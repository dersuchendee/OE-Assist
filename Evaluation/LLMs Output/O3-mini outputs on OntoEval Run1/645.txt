**Yes**

The ontology supports this CQ because it explicitly models performances with the class Cl_Performance and tracks when a performance took place using the performedDuring property (with range xsd:dateTime). Under the closed world assumption, you can extract the relevant information directly. For example, you can use the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedDuring ?performanceDate .
}
