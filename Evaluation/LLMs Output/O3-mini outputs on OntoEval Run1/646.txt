**Yes**

Assuming that the performance is modelled as an instance of the class Cl_Performance and the date it took place is captured by the data property performanceDate, we can answer the CQ under a closed world assumption. For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves all performances along with the date at which they occurred:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}

This query extracts the answer to "When did a certain performance take place?" from the ontology.
