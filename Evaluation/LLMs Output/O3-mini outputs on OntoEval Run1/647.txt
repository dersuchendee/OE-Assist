**Yes**
Assuming that “a certain performance” is identified (for example, by its URI or label), you can retrieve its date via the performance‐participation reification. For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?pp a :Cl_PerformanceParticipation .
  ?pp :performance ?performance .
  ?pp :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
  # (Optional) Filter to a specific performance:
  # FILTER(?performance = <http://www.example.org/test#YourPerformanceURI>)
}

This query retrieves the performance and its associated date from the ontology using the reified triple in Cl_PerformanceParticipation, so the CQ is fully supported.
