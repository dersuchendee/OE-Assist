**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that extracts, for a given performance, all the songs (with their labels, when available) played in that performance:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance ;
               rdfs:label ?performanceLabel ;
               :hasSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  # Uncomment the FILTER below to restrict to a specific performance if desired:
  # FILTER(STR(?performanceLabel) = "Live performance in Portland, Oregon on August 11, 2006")
}
------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, this query retrieves the songs played during each performance (or a specified one), demonstrating that the ontology models the competency question.
