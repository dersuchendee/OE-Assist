**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‑world reading of the ontology, retrieves the songs played in each performance:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  
  ?performance :hasSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports the competency question “What songs were played in a certain performance?” since it connects the Performance class with the Song class via the property :hasSong.
