**Yes**

We can answer the CQ with the ontology since it uses the reified class Cl_SongPerformance (with properties performedAt and performedSong) to link a performance to its played songs. Under the closed-world assumption, we assume that every played song is recorded using a Cl_SongPerformance instance.

Below is a SPARQL query that extracts the songs played in a given performance (replace <PERFORMANCE_URI> with the URI of the performance of interest):

--------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?sp a :Cl_SongPerformance ;
      :performedAt <PERFORMANCE_URI> ;
      :performedSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel. }
}
