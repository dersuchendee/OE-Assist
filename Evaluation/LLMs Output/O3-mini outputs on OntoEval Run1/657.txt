**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves for a specified performance (or for all performances if no filter is applied) the songs that were played:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?song ?songName ?playedOn
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_PlayedSong .
  ?performance :hasSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song :songName ?songName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :playedOn ?playedOn . }
  # To target a specific performance, you could add a FILTER or bind a specific IRI, for example:
  # FILTER(?performance = <http://www.example.org/test#Performance_123>)
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?playedOn
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question "Which songs were played in a certain performance?" by selecting each performance (of type Cl_PlayedSong), retrieving its associated songs via the :hasSong property, and optionally extracting the song name and the time the song was played.
