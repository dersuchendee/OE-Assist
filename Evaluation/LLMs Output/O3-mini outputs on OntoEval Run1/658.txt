**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each performance, the songs that were played. Note that under the closed world assumption, we assume that only the explicitly asserted triples are true.

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }

  ?performance :performedSong ?performanceSong .
  ?performanceSong :songPerformed ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance

This query shows that the ontology models the CQ “What songs were played in a certain performance?” by allowing one to extract the relationship between a performance and the songs played.
