**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that extracts the songs played in a given performance using the reified relationships defined in the ontology:

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  
  # The reified relationship linking performance and songs:
  ?performance :playedSong ?ps .
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :songPlayed ?ps .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  
  # To select a specific performance, you could add a FILTER, e.g.,
  # FILTER(?performance = :Performance1)
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “What songs were played in a certain performance?” by retrieving the performance, its played song reification (via :playedSong and :songPlayed), and the associated song labels.
