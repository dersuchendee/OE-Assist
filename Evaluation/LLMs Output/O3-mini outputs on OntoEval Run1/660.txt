**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the performances and the songs played in each performance:

-------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel. }
  
  ?performance :hasSong ?performanceSong .
  ?performanceSong a :Cl_Song .
  BIND(?performanceSong AS ?song)
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song
-------------------------------------------------------

This query uses the reified relation between performance and song (via Cl_PerformanceSong) as defined in the ontology, so the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" is fully answerable.
