**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the songs played in each performance by using the setlist information:

-----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?song
WHERE {
  ?setlist a :Cl_PerformanceSetlist ;
           :performedDuring ?performance ;
           :includesSong ?song .
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

In a closed‚Äêworld setting we assume that all relevant instances have been asserted, so the query above fully answers the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?"
