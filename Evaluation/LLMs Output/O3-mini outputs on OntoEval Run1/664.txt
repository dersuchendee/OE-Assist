**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each performance, the songs performed at that event by leveraging the reified PerformanceSong relationships:

--------------------------------------------------

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?song
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
  ?performanceSong a :Cl_PerformanceSong ;
                   :performedAt ?performance ;
                   :performedSong ?song .
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?performanceDate ?song

--------------------------------------------------

This query finds all individuals of type Cl_Performance, then, via the reified relation (i.e. instances of Cl_PerformanceSong), it connects each performance with the songs performed.
