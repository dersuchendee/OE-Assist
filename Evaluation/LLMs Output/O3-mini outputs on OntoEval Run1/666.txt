**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query using the ontologyâ€™s classes and properties that retrieves the songs played during a specified performance (here the performance with date "2006-08-11"):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate "2006-08-11"^^xsd:date ;
               :hasLocation ?location .
  
  # Link the performance to the songs that were performed.
  ?perfSong a :Cl_PerformanceSong ;
            :performedAt ?performance ;
            :performedSong ?song .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel }.
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question ("Which songs were played in a certain performance?") is answerable using the ontology.
