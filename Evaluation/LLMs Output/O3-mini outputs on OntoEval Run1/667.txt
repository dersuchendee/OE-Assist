**Yes**

We can retrieve the songs played during a performance using the reified property that connects a Cl_Performance with one or more Cl_Song resources. For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?performance ?song
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedSongs ?song .
}

This SPARQL query lists each performance and the songs that were performed, thereby fully answering the CQ under the closed-world assumption.
