Below is a sample SPARQL query that uses the reified structure for performances and performed songs to list the songs played during a given performance (identified by its IRI, e.g., :Performance_1):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  # Select the target performance (adjust the IRI filter as needed)
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  FILTER(?performance = :Performance_1) .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  
  # Get the performed songs during that performance via the reified relation
  ?performance :includesSong ?performedSong .
  ?performedSong :songPerformed ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
