Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each performance, the songs that were played during that performance (using the reified representation via the class Cl_SongPerformance):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?songPerformance a :Cl_SongPerformance .
  ?songPerformance :inPerformance ?performance .
  ?songPerformance :performedSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song
------------------------------------------------

This query uses the closed world assumption by relying on the explicit individuals stated in the ontology.
