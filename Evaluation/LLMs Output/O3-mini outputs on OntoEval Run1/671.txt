**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the songs played in any performance by making use of the performedSongs property connecting a Cl_Performance instance to a Cl_Song instance:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?song ?songLabel ?composedDate
WHERE {
  # Select performances (optionally, a specific one could be filtered)
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :performedOn ?performanceDate . }
  
  # Get the songs performed in the performance
  ?performance :performedSongs ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?song :composedDate ?composedDate . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song

This query answers the competency question “What songs were played in a certain performance?” by extracting for each performance the songs that were performed (using the performedSongs property) along with any available labels, dates, or other song metadata.
