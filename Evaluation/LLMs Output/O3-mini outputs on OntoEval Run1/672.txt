**Yes**

We can answer this CQ using the reification introduced in the ontology. One way to retrieve the songs played as part of a performance is to use the property chain defined by:
• a performance has associated performance songs (via :performedSongs), and  
• each performance song “includesSong” the actual song.

A SPARQL query under the closed‐world assumption might look like:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  
  ?performance :performedSongs ?performanceSong .
  ?performanceSong :includesSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  
  # Optionally restrict to a particular performance by URI:
  # FILTER (?performance = <http://www.example.org/test#SomePerformanceID>)
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?songLabel

This query retrieves each performance (and its label) along with the songs (and their labels) that were played in that performance.
