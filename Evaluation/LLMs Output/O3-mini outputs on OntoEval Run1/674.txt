**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each performance (or for a specified performance), the venue where it took place:

-----------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?venue ?venueLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  ?performance :performedAt ?venue .
  OPTIONAL { ?venue rdfs:label ?venueLabel . }
  
  # Uncomment the following line to filter for a specific performance by label:
  # FILTER (str(?performanceLabel) = "Live Performance in Portland")
}
-----------------

This query answers the competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" by extracting which venue each performance is associated with via the property :performedAt.
