**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology uses the class for live performances (e.g. :Cl_LivePerformance) and the data property :hasLocation to record the performanceâ€™s location, the CQ "Where did a certain performance take place?" is fully answerable. Under the closed world assumption the following SPARQL query would retrieve each performance along with its location:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_LivePerformance .
  ?performance :hasLocation ?location .
}
