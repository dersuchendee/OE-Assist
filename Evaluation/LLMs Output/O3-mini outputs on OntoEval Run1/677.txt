**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the location at which a given performance occurred:

---------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  ?performance :hasLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}
---------------------------------------------------------

This query makes use of the modeled property :hasLocation on a :Performance instance to extract the corresponding location, thereby fully answering the CQ "Where did a certain performance take place?"
