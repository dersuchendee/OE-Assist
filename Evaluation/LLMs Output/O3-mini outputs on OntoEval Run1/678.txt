**Yes**  
Below is one SPARQL query that extracts the locations (of type Cl_Place) where a performance (an instance of Cl_PerformanceEvent) took place, using the isLocationOfPerformance property:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performanceEvent ?place
WHERE {
  ?place a :Cl_Place .
  ?place :isLocationOfPerformance ?performanceEvent .
}
--------------------------------------------------

In a closed-world scenario, we assume that all individuals of Cl_Place and Cl_PerformanceEvent are completely specified, so the query retrieves the performance events along with their associated locations as modelled by the ontology.
