**Yes**

We can retrieve the venue where a performance took place using the property :performedIn. For example, a SPARQL query that uses the closed world view to answer “Where did a certain performance take place?” could be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?venue
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performedIn ?venue .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate . }
}

This query returns any individual of type :Cl_Performance (including, for instance, :PerformanceStadiumArcadiumPortland) along with its performance date (if available) and the corresponding venue (e.g. :Portland_Oregon).
