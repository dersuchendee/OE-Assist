**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the performance along with its geographic location (i.e. the city where the performance took place):

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?performance ?city
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedIn ?city .
}
--------------------------------

This query works under a closed world assumption by returning only those performances that have an explicit :performedIn relation to a city (such as :Performance_Portland performedIn :Portland_Oregon).
