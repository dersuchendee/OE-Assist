**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that extracts, for each performance, its associated location and the location’s name (according to the final portion of the ontology which defines Cl_Performance, Cl_Location and the property :tookPlaceAt with a data property :locationName):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :tookPlaceAt ?loc .
  ?loc :locationName ?locationName .
}
--------------------------------------------------

Under the closed‐world interpretation, only explicitly asserted locations are considered, so this query returns the intended answer if the competency question is “Which performance took place at which location?” or a variation thereof.
