**Yes**

We can extract the performance location directly from the ontology using the role of the performance class (Cl_Performance) and the property (hasLocation). For example, the query below retrieves each performance along with its location:

————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :hasLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel. }
}
————————————————————————————

This query shows that the competency question “Where did a certain performance take place?” is answerable with the given ontology under the closed world assumption.
