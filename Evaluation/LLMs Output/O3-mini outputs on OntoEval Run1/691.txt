SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  ?performance :performanceLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves each performance (and its optional label) along with its associated location (and its optional label), thus fully answering the competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" under a closed world assumption.
