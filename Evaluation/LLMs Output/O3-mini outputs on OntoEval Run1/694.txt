**Yes**

Assuming we know which performance we're interested in (or want to list all performances with their locations), you can use a query like the following:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceLocation ?location .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the performance instance along with the location where it took place, which addresses the competency question under the closed world assumption.
