**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves performances along with the locations where they took place. In this ontology the location of a performance is modeled using the property “performedAt” whose range is the reified class :Cl_PerformanceLocation.

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedAt ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?performance
------------------------------------------------------------

This query works under the closed world assumption—only performances explicitly linked to a location via the property :performedAt are returned.
