**No**  
The ontology does not directly model a connection between a Source and its context of production. However, if we assume (under a closed world assumption) that a Source might be indirectly related to a Context of Production via an Organ (for which the context is defined), you could at best retrieve a partial answer. For example, if a Source provides unreliable information about an Organ Component that is part of an Organ with a defined production context, you can query that relation as follows:

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?source ?context ?organBuilder ?productionTime ?productionLocation
WHERE {
  ?source a :Source .
  ?source :hasUnreliableInformation ?component .
  ?component :isComponentOf ?organ .
  ?organ :hasContextOfProduction ?context .
  OPTIONAL { ?context :producedBy ?organBuilder . }
  OPTIONAL { ?context :hasProductionTime ?productionTime . }
  OPTIONAL { ?context :hasProductionLocation ?productionLocation . }
}
----------------------------------

This query returns a partial answer by linking a Source (through its unreliable information on an Organ Component) to an Organ and then to that Organâ€™s Context of Production. Notice that because there is no direct property linking a Source to a ContextOfProduction, the answer remains partial.
