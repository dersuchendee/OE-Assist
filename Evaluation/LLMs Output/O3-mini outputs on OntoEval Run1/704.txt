**Yes**

Assuming that a “certain city” is represented as an instance of Cl_City and that its region is linked via the properties “cityRegion” (from a city to a city-region) and “regionOfCity” (from a city-region to a region), one can extract the answer with the following SPARQL query (using the closed world assumption):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?region ?regionLabel
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
  
  ?city :cityRegion ?cityRegion .
  ?cityRegion :regionOfCity ?region .
  OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionLabel . }
  
  # Optionally filter for a specific city, for example by its label:
  # FILTER (regex(?cityLabel, "SpecificCityName", "i"))
}
