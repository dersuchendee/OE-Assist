**Yes**

Assuming the city is asserted as an instance of Cl_City and its region is connected via the object property :locatedIn, the following SPARQL query (under a closed world assumption) would return the region for each city:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?region .
}

This query retrieves every individual of type Cl_City along with the region in which it is located.
