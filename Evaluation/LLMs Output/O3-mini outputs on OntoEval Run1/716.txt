**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology has been populated with individuals of type Cl_Region and Cl_Country and that the relation :isInCountry correctly links a region to its country, you can fully answer the CQ “In what country is a certain region located?” with the following SPARQL query under closed world assumptions:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?region ?regionLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  ?region :isInCountry ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
}
