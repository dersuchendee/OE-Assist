SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  ?region :isLocatedIn ?country .
}
```

In this query we retrieve each instance of a region (a member of Cl_Region) together with the country it is located in (via the :isLocatedIn property). This shows that the competency question “In what country is a certain region located?” is directly answerable given the provided ontology under a closed world assumption.
