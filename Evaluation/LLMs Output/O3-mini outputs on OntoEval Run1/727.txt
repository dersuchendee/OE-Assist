**Yes**

The ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to relate a region to a country. In particular, regions (of type :Cl_Region) are connected by the property :regionCountry to an intermediate class (e.g. a region’s country wrapper, :Cl_RegionCountry) which in turn links via the property :countryOfRegion to a country (of type :Cl_Country). Under the closed‐world assumption, we can assume that these links present in the data are all we need to answer the question.

A SPARQL query to extract the answer is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?region ?regionLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionLabel . }
  
  ?region :regionCountry ?regionCountry .
  ?regionCountry :countryOfRegion ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
} 

This query retrieves each region and its corresponding country by following the chain of properties defined in the ontology.
