**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that answers the competency question “In what country is a certain region located?” by retrieving for each region the country in which it is located (using the property :regionInCountry):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?region ?regionLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionLabel. }
  
  ?region :regionInCountry ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel. }
}

This query is written under the closed world assumption, in that it only retrieves those region–country relationships that are explicitly stated in the ontology.
