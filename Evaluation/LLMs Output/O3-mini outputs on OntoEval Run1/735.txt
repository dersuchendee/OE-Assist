**Yes**

Assuming a closed world view, we can extract the country for each region by querying for instances of the region class and using the “isPartOf” property to obtain the country. For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  ?region :isPartOf ?country .
}
ORDER BY ?region

This query answers the competency question “In what country is a certain region located?” by returning each region and the country (from :isPartOf) in which it is located.
