**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the date of a given theatre festival (here assumed to be identified via its name, for example “Roma Loves Shakespeare”) by exploiting the reified occurrence information (using the Cl_FestivalOccurrence class and the :hasDate property):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festivalName ?date
WHERE {
  ?occurrence a :Cl_FestivalOccurrence ;
              :hasDate ?date .
  ?occurrence :hasName ?festivalName .
  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?festivalName), "roma loves shakespeare"))
}

In a closed‐world scenario this query will only return those occurrences explicitly asserted in the ontology. This shows that the competency question “When did a certain theatre festival take place?” is modelled by the ontology.
