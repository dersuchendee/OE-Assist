**Yes**

Assuming a closed‚Äêworld view (i.e. if a record is present then the absence of an explicit track means it really has none), we can check that every instance of a record (of type :Cl_Record) has an associated track by the reified property :containsTrack linking to an instance of :Cl_RecordTrack (which is a subclass of both :Cl_Record and :Cl_Track). For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves each record along with its track instance:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?record ?recordTrack
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Record.
  ?record :containsTrack ?recordTrack.
  ?recordTrack a :Cl_RecordTrack.
  ?recordTrack :containedInRecord ?record.
}
ORDER BY ?record
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that each record has at least one associated track, thereby answering the competency question.
