**Yes**
Assuming that the individual is identified (for example, by the IRI :PasqualeDiGennaro), you can use a query like the following to retrieve all the medical degrees (including nursing degrees as a subclass) that a person has:

---------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/medical_degrees#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?degree ?degreeLabel
WHERE {
  :PasqualeDiGennaro a :Person ;
                      :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree rdfs:label ?degreeLabel . }
}
---------------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, if no triples assert a given medical degree for this person then the person has none. This SPARQL query demonstrates that the competency question “What medical degrees does a certain person have?” is modelled by the ontology.
