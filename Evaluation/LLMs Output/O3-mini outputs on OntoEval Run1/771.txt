Assuming that individuals of the class Person are linked to their degree(s) via the property :hasDegree and that medical degrees are those individuals explicitly classified as :MedicalDegree, the following SPARQL query can be used (under a closed‚Äêworld assumption) to retrieve the medical degrees (with their name and date) of a given person:

SELECT ?degree ?degreeName ?degreeDate
WHERE {
  # Replace <personIRI> with the IRI of the person of interest.
  <personIRI> a :Person ;
               :hasDegree ?degree .
               
  ?degree a :MedicalDegree .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeName ?degreeName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeDate ?degreeDate . }
