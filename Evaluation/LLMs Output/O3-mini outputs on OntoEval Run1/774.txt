**Yes**

Assuming that the “certain person” is identified by an IRI (for example, :PasqualeDiGennaro) and that the ontology uses the class :Cl_Person for persons and the property :hasMedicalDegree to relate a person to an instance of :Cl_MedicalDegree with an optional textual name given by the property :degreeName, a SPARQL query to answer the CQ would be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?degree ?degreeName
WHERE {
  :PasqualeDiGennaro a :Cl_Person ;
                      :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeName ?degreeName . }
}

This query retrieves all the medical degree instances associated with the person using the closed‐world assumption (i.e. only the information explicitly stored in the ontology is considered).
