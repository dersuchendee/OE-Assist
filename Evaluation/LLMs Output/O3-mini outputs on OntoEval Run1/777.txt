**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the medical degrees (including properties such as title and obtained date when available) for a given person (for example, PasqualeDiGennaro):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeTitle ?obtainedDate
WHERE {
  ?person rdf:type :Cl_Person ;
          :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeObtainedDate ?obtainedDate. }
  FILTER(?person = :PasqualeDiGennaro)
}

This query shows that the ontology models the competency question “What medical degrees does a certain person have?” by directly linking a person to their medical degrees along with associated data properties.
