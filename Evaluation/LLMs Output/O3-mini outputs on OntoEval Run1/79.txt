**Yes**

Assuming that the festival to be investigated has a name (e.g., “Roma Loves Shakespeare”) and that its time information is stored by associating it with a TimePeriod (via :takesPlaceDuring) that has start and end dates (via :hasStartDate and :hasEndDate), a SPARQL query to retrieve when that theatre festival took place is for example:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival ;
            :hasName "Roma Loves Shakespeare" ;
            :takesPlaceDuring ?period .
  ?period :hasStartDate ?startDate ;
          :hasEndDate ?endDate .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the start and end dates of the festival “Roma Loves Shakespeare.”
