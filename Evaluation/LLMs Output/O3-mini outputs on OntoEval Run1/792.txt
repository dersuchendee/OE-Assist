**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each person, the degree they studied for together with the corresponding study period (i.e. the start and end dates):

PREFIX : <http://example.org/medical_degrees#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person .
  ?person :studiesFor ?degree .
  ?degree :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :hasStartDate ?startDate .
  ?studyPeriod :hasEndDate ?endDate .
}

Under the closed world assumption and given that the ontology reifies the study period of a degree via the properties “hasStudyPeriod”, “hasStartDate”, and “hasEndDate”, the competency question is fully supported by the ontology.
