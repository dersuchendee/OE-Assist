**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology’s second model (with Cl_Person, Cl_Degree, Cl_TimePeriod, and Cl_StudyEvent) is used to capture study events, we can answer the competency question “During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?” by linking a person’s participation in a study event, the degree awarded in that event, and the associated time period (with start and end dates). Under a closed-world assumption, only explicitly stated events and properties are considered.

A possible SPARQL query is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :participatedInStudyEvent ?studyEvent .
  ?degree a :Cl_Degree ;
          :isDegreeOfStudyEvent ?studyEvent .
  ?timePeriod a :Cl_TimePeriod ;
              :isPeriodOfStudyEvent ?studyEvent ;
              :hasStartDate ?startDate ;
              :hasEndDate ?endDate .
}

This query retrieves, for each person and degree linked by the same study event, the corresponding time period (start and end dates) during which the study took place.
