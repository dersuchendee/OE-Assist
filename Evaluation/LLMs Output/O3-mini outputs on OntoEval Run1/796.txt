Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each person, the study period (with its starting and ending dates) during which they pursued a specific degree:

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?degree ?degreeLabel ?fromDate ?toDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  
  ?person :studiedDuring ?studyPeriod .
  
  ?studyPeriod :forDegree ?degree .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree rdfs:label ?degreeLabel . }
  
  ?studyPeriod :fromDate ?fromDate .
  ?studyPeriod :toDate ?toDate .
}
ORDER BY ?person ?fromDate
------------------------------------------------------------

This query extracts, for each person, the study period during which they studied for a particular degree (ensuring that the time period information, including the starting and ending dates, is modeled in the ontology via the :Cl_StudyPeriod class).
