**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each person, the degree for which they studied together with the (reified) study period:

────────────────────────────
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyPeriod
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :studiedFor ?studyInstance .
  ?studyInstance :studyPeriod ?studyPeriod ;
                 :studiedFor ?degree .
}
ORDER BY ?person ?studyPeriod
────────────────────────────

In this query the property :studiedFor is used in a reified way linking a person to a study instance (of type :Cl_PersonDegreeStudy) and further linking that study to the (medical) degree (of type :Cl_MedicalDegree). Thus the competency question “During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?” is modelled and answerable by the ontology under a closed‐world assumption.
