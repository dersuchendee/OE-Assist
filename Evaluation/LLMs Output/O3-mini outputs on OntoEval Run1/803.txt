**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for each person the study period (start and end dates) during which they acquired a given degree:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degreeName ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :hasMedicalDegree ?pmd .
  ?pmd :degreeOf ?degree ;
       :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?degree :degreeName ?degreeName .
  ?studyPeriod :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate ;
               :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
}
ORDER BY ?person ?degreeName
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the CQ “During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?” by linking a person to their medical degree information (via :hasMedicalDegree) and extracting the corresponding study period dates from the connected reified study period instance.
