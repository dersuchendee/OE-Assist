**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each person and each of their medical degrees, the study period (start and end dates) during which they pursued that degree:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate ;
               :studyEndDate   ?studyEndDate .
}
------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming a closed world where only explicitly asserted facts are available, this query extracts the complete answer to the CQ "During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?" from the ontology.
