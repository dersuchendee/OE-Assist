**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves a person, their corresponding degree, and the study period (start and end dates) using the reified pattern (Cl_PersonDegreeStudy):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyStart ?studyEnd
WHERE {
  ?studyRecord a :Cl_PersonDegreeStudy .
  ?studyRecord :personHasStudy ?person .
  ?studyRecord :studyInvolvesDegree ?degree .
  ?studyRecord :studyDuringPeriod ?period .
  ?period :studyStart ?studyStart .
  ?period :studyEnd ?studyEnd .
}
ORDER BY ?person ?studyStart

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question "During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?" by connecting the person, degree, and study period through the reified class.
