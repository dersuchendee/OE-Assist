A competency question asking “During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?” is answerable using the reified study period class (Cl_PersonDegreeStudyPeriod) from the ontology. This class is connected to a person (via :hasPerson), to a degree (via :hasDegree) and has data properties capturing the start and end dates of the study period (via :studyStartDate and :studyEndDate). Under a closed world assumption, we assume that if no study period is asserted for a given person and degree then it does not exist.

For example, the following SPARQL query extracts the study period (start and end date) for each person–degree combination:

-------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?studyPeriod a :Cl_PersonDegreeStudyPeriod ;
               :hasPerson ?person ;
               :hasDegree ?degree ;
               :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate ;
               :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
}
ORDER BY ?person ?studyStartDate
-------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the CQ by recognizing the reified study period that binds a person, a degree, and the corresponding dates.
