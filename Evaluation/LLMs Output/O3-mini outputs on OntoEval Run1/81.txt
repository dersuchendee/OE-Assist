**Yes**
Below is one way to write a SPARQL query that, given a specific theatre festival (e.g. by its IRI), retrieves the date on which it took place:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :hasDate ?date .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  # If you want to restrict to a specific festival, uncomment and adjust the following line:
  # FILTER(?festival = <http://www.example.org/test#RomaLovesShakespeare>)
}
ORDER BY ?date

With the above query, using the closed world assumption, the ontology supports the competency question "When did a certain theatre festival take place?" by returning the festival date(s) from the triple(s) matching the :hasDate property on instances of :Cl_TheatreFestival.
