**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that returns the earliest employment date for a given person at a given hospital using the employment reification in the ontology:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?date) AS ?firstEmployment)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Employee ;
          :hasEmployment ?employment ;
          :employedAt ?hospital .
  ?employment :employmentDate ?date .
  # Replace the IRIs below for the specific person and hospital, e.g.,:
  FILTER(?person = :PasqualeDiGennaro && ?hospital = :OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli)
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
------------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the CQ – “When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?” – by extracting the minimum (i.e. earliest) employment date from the available employment events in the ontology under closed world assumptions.
