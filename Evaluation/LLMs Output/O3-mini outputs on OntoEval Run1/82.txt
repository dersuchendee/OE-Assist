**Yes**

Assuming that each theatre festival is modelled as an instance of :Cl_TheatreFestival with its date recorded using the property :date (and that a festival may have a label), one can write a query to obtain the date of a specific festival (for instance, one whose label contains “Roma Loves Shakespeare”). Under the closed‐world assumption this query extracts the complete answer. For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :date ?date .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  FILTER(regex(?festivalLabel, "Roma Loves Shakespeare", "i"))
}

This SPARQL query returns the festival (and its label) along with the date it took place, thus fully modelling the competency question.
