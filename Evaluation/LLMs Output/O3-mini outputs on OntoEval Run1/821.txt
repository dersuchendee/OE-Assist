Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves the earliest employment date for a given person at a given hospital. (In this example the person and hospital are specified by their IRIs; you may replace the IRIs with the individuals of interest.)

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?employmentDate) AS ?firstEmployment)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :employedAt ?employmentRecord .
  ?employmentRecord :employmentDate ?employmentDate .
  ?employmentRecord :employedAt ?hospital .
  
  # Filter for the specific person and hospital (adjust IRIs as needed)
  FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro> && 
         ?hospital = <http://www.example.org/test#OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli>)
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital

Explanation:
• The ontology reifies the employment event via the class :Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment.
• A person is connected via the property :employedAt to an employment record.
• That record carries the employment date (via :employmentDate) and is ensured (by a restriction) to involve a hospital (retrieved via the same property :employedAt).
• The query groups by person and hospital and uses MIN() to select the earliest employment date, answering the competency question “When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?”
