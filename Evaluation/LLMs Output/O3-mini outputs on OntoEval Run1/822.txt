**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that returns, for each person and hospital, the earliest employment start date:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?date) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?date .
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?” by retrieving, for each person–hospital combination, the minimum (earliest) employment start date from the ontology.
