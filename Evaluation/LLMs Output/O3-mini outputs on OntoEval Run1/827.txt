Assuming that the ontology’s employment reification connects a person with a hospital via an instance of Cl_Employment that has an employment date via the :employmentDate property, you can answer “When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?” by retrieving the minimum employment date for that person–hospital combination (under the closed‐world assumption).

For example, the following SPARQL query returns, for every person and hospital pair, the earliest employment date:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?employmentDate) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment ;
              :employee ?person ;
              :employedAt ?hospital ;
              :employmentDate ?employmentDate .
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital

This query extracts the answer to the competency question from the given ontology.
