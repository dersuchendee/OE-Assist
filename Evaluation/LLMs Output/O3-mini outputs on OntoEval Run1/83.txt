**Yes**

Assuming the “certain theatre festival” is identified (for example with a label or URI), you can extract its date using the :hasDate property. For instance, if the festival is known by its label “Roma Loves Shakespeare”, you could write:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :hasDate ?date ;
            rdfs:label "Roma Loves Shakespeare" .
}

If the festival is specified by another identifier or parameter, you can adjust the FILTER or triple pattern accordingly.
