**Yes**

Assuming that a “certain person” and “a certain hospital” are identified by their IRIs (e.g. via parameters), the ontology supports this CQ because it reifies employment with the class :Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment, the property :employedAt (linking the employment record to the hospital) and the data property :employmentStartDate (indicating when the employment began). In other words, one can ask “when was person X first employed at hospital Y?” by querying for employment records of type :Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment (which—via its multiple superclass assertions—is also treated as a person) and then taking the minimum value of :employmentStartDate.

For example, here is a SPARQL query that, given a person (as ?person) and hospital (as ?hospital), returns the earliest employment start date:

----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?date) AS ?firstEmployment)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person, :Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment ;
          :employedAt ?hospital ;
          :employmentStartDate ?date .
  # (Optional: restrict to a given person and hospital by providing their IRIs)
  # FILTER (?person = <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro> &&
  #         ?hospital = <http://www.example.org/test#OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli>)
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
ORDER BY ?firstEmployment
----------------------------------------------------------

This query finds, for each person employed at a hospital, the earliest (i.e. first) employment start date. Hence, the ontology fully supports answering the CQ.
