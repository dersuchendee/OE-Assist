The ontology provides a Hospital class that is defined to be located in a City (via the "isLocatedIn" property). Thus, given an individual hospital (for example, “Ospedale Riunito delle Tre Valli”), you can write a SPARQL query that retrieves the city where the hospital is located.

Below is an example query:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
  ?hospital :isLocatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query returns each hospital along with its (optional) label and the city in which it is located.
