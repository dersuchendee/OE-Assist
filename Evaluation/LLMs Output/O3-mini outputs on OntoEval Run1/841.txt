**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, extracts for each hospital its associated city (using the defined :hasLocation property and the city’s name via :cityName):

---------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
  ?hospital :hasLocation ?city .
  ?city :cityName ?cityName .
}
---------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports the competency question “In what city is a certain hospital located?” by retrieving the city (and its name) for each hospital.
