**Yes**

We can fully answer this CQ using the provided ontology. For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves the city (via the :locatedIn property) in which each hospital is located:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?city
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
}

This query directly extracts the answer by finding all instances of :Cl_Hospital and their associated city through the :locatedIn property.
