**Yes**

Assuming the ontology has individuals for hospitals linked to the city where they are located via the property :locatedIn (with domain :Cl_Hospital and range :Cl_City), you can answer the competency question. Here is an example SPARQL query:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?hospital ?city
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves each hospital and the corresponding city where it is located, fulfilling the competency question "In what city is a certain hospital located?" under the closed world assumption.
