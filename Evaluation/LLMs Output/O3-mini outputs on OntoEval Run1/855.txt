**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that uses the ontologyâ€™s classes and the :locatedIn property to retrieve the city in which hospitals are located:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital ;
            :locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query returns each hospital along with its associated city, which addresses the competency question "In what city is a certain hospital located?" under a closed world assumption.
