**No**

The ontology contains a reified Festival Occurrence (class :Cl_FestivalOccurrence) that holds a date via the property :hasDate, but there is no explicit connection in the ontology linking a specific theatre festival (e.g. an instance of :Cl_TheatreFestival) to its occurrence. Under a closed world assumption, we can only partially answer the competency question by listing all occurrences with their dates. For example, one could use a query like:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festivalOccurrence ?date
WHERE {
  ?festivalOccurrence a :Cl_FestivalOccurrence .
  ?festivalOccurrence :hasDate ?date .
}

This query extracts the dates recorded for festival occurrences, providing only a partial answer to the CQ.
