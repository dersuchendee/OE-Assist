**Yes**

The ontology supports the competency question since it defines a class for cities (Cl_City) and an object property (locatedIn) that links a city to a country (Cl_Country). Under the closed world assumption, you can extract the answer by retrieving the country associated with a given city. For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
}

This query retrieves each city along with its associated country, thereby answering the CQ "In what country is a certain city located?"
