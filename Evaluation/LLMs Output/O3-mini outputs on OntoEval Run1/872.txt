The ontology defines a class for cities (:Cl_City) and one for countries (:Cl_Country), along with the object property :cityInCountry (with domain :Cl_City and range :Cl_Country). This provides a clear link between a city and the country in which it is located. Therefore, given a particular city we can query for the country that it is located in.

For example, the following SPARQL query returns the country for each city:

------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityInCountry ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
}
------------------------------

This query retrieves each city and its associated country as modelled in the ontology.
