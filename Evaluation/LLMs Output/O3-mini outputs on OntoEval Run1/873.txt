**Yes**

Assuming the city in question is represented as an instance of Cl_City with an explicit property linking it to its country (via the :cityInCountry property), the following SPARQL query extracts, for each city, the corresponding country:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City ;
        :cityInCountry ?country .
}
--------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, only explicitly asserted relationships appear; since the ontology contains a triple stating that, for example, Nocera_Inferiore (an instance of Cl_City) is linked to Italy, the query supports the competency question.
