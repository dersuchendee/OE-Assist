**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the country of a given city (e.g., “Nocera Inferiore”) by exploiting the relationships between a city, its city location, and the country:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?city ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City ;
        :cityName "Nocera Inferiore" .
  ?cityLocation a :Cl_CityLocation ;
                :cityLocationOf ?city ;
                :cityLocatedIn ?country .
  ?country :countryName ?countryName .
}

In a closed‐world setting, since the ontology explicitly provides that “Nocera Inferiore” is located in “Italy”, this query fully answers the competency question "In what country is a certain city located?"
