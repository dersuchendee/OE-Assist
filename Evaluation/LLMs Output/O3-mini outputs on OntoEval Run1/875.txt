**Yes**

Assuming the ontology follows a closed world assumption, the CQ “In what country is a certain city located?” is answerable because the ontology defines a class for cities (:Cl_City), a class for countries (:Cl_Country), and an object property (:isLocatedIn) that links a city to its country. Under this assumption, if a city has an :isLocatedIn relation, we assume that this is the complete information available.

A SPARQL query to extract the answer could be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel. }
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel. }
}

This query retrieves each instance of :Cl_City and its associated country via the :isLocatedIn property, producing the answer needed for the competency question.
