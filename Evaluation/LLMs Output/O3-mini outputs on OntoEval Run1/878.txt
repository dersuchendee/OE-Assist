**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology includes cities as instances of :Cl_City and that the object property :isLocatedIn links a city to a country (an instance of :Cl_Country), you can answer the CQ “In what country is a certain city located?” with a SPARQL query. For example, if you want the country for a specific city (say, an individual :NoceraInferiore), you could write:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
  FILTER(?city = :NoceraInferiore)
}

If you want to list all cities along with the country in which they are located, you could omit the FILTER:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
}

This query shows that the CQ is supported within the ontology under a closed world assumption.
