**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the festival’s name along with its date by following the reified structure (Festival → Festival Event → Festival Date):

---------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festivalName ?eventDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :festivalName ?festivalName ;
            :hasFestivalEvent ?event .
  ?event :hasDate ?date .
  ?date :eventDate ?eventDate .
  # Filter to focus on the specific festival (adjust the string as needed)
  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?festivalName), "roma loves shakespeare"))
}
---------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the date information for a given theatre festival can be extracted from the ontology, hence the CQ is fully supported.
