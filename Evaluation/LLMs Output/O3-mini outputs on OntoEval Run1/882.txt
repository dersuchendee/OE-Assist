**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, using the union‐membership reification in the ontology (via the Cl_UnionMembership class and its properties :hasMember, :hasUnion, and :hasStartDate), retrieves the staff person(s) who are members of a specified union at a given point in time. (In this example the union is given as :UnionOfMaleNurses and we filter memberships whose start date is on or before a supplied query date.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?startDate 
WHERE {
  ?membership rdf:type :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :hasUnion :UnionOfMaleNurses ;    # change this to the desired union
              :hasMember ?person ;
              :hasStartDate ?startDate .
  # Assuming that a membership is valid from its start date onward (no end date provided),
  # we return those memberships that started on or before the given query date.
  FILTER(?startDate <= "2005-01-01"^^xsd:date)   # replace with the desired point in time
}

This query shows that the competency question—“Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?”—is fully answerable using the ontology.
