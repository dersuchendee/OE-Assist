**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves those persons who are members of a specified union (here illustrated using ns1:MaleNurseUnion) at a given point in time (supplied as a parameter ?givenTime). This query assumes that union membership is recorded via a membership entity (using ns1:memberOf and ns1:hasUnion) that carries one or more time intervals (using time:hasBeginning and optionally time:hasEnd). You may replace the union URI and the given time with those appropriate for your query context.

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX time: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personLabel ?membership ?start ?end
WHERE {
  # Retrieve persons with union memberships
  ?person ns1:memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership ns1:hasUnion ns1:MaleNurseUnion .
  
  # Obtain the membership period
  ?membership ns1:hasMembershipPeriod ?period .
  ?period time:hasBeginning ?start .
  OPTIONAL { ?period time:hasEnd ?end . }
  
  # Filter by the given time (replace the literal with the actual query time)
  BIND("2002-06-01T00:00:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime AS ?givenTime)
  FILTER ( ?givenTime >= ?start && ( !BOUND(?end) || ?givenTime <= ?end ) )
  
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
}
------------------------------------------------

This query returns the persons (and their labels if available) who were union members of ns1:MaleNurseUnion at the specified moment in time.
