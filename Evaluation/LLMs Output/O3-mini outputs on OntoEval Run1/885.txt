**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that answers the CQ “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” using the reified union membership structure found in the ontology. In this query you can replace the URI for the target union (<targetUnionIRI>) and the target date “2022-01-01T00:00:00”^^xsd:dateTime with the actual values for your query.

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?employee
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :hasUnion ?union ;
              :hasEmployee ?employee ;
              :hasTimePoint ?timePoint .
  ?timePoint :timeValue ?time .
  FILTER(?union = <targetUnionIRI>)
  FILTER(?time = "2022-01-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
--------------------------------------------------

In a closed world context we assume that only the explicitly asserted union memberships exist; thus this query will extract all the members (employees) of the given union at the specified time.
