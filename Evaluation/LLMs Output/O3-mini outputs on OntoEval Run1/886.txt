**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology’s class :UnionMembership models the engagement of a person as a member of a union during a specific time interval (using the properties :hasMember, :hasUnion, and :hasTimeInterval with associated start and end dates), we can answer the competency question “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” under a closed world assumption. For example, given a specific union URI (e.g., <http://example.org/ontology#SomeUnion>) and a point in time (provided as a dateTime value), the following SPARQL query retrieves the persons who are members of that union at that time:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?start ?end
WHERE {
  ?membership a :UnionMembership ;
              :hasUnion <http://example.org/ontology#SomeUnion> ;
              :hasMember ?person ;
              :hasTimeInterval ?interval .
  
  ?interval :startDate ?start ;
            :endDate ?end .
  
  # Specify the point in time for which we want to query membership
  BIND("2008-05-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime AS ?pointInTime) .

  # Check that the specified time is within the membership interval
  FILTER(?pointInTime >= ?start && ?pointInTime <= ?end)

  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?person
------------------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the members (and optionally their labels) whose union membership time interval (between ?start and ?end) covers the given "?pointInTime".
