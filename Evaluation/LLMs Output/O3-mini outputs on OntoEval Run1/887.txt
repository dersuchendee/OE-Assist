Below is an example SPARQL query that (under a closed‐world assumption) retrieves the union’s employees who were members at a given point in time. (In the query below, replace "UnionName" with the label (or identifier) of the union you wish to query and adjust the literal for the query time as needed.)

This query answers the competency question “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” by using the reified union membership class that links a union with its member (employee) along with a time period indicating when that membership was active.
