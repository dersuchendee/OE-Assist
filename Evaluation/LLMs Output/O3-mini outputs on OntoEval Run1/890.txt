**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, selects persons who hold a union membership for a specified union (here represented by a placeholder :UnionXYZ) that began before or on a given point in time (here “2002-01-01T00:00:00” as an example):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personName ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personName . }
  
  ?person :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
  ?membership :memberOf ?union .
  
  FILTER(?union = :UnionXYZ && ?membershipDate <= "2002-01-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
ORDER BY ?person

In this query the union of interest and the time‐point are provided (you can substitute :UnionXYZ and the date with the actual union URI and date). This demonstrates that the ontology directly supports obtaining “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” as required.
