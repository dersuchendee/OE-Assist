**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a particular union (here “UnionOfMaleNurses”) and a target date, retrieves all persons whose union membership started on or before that date (and—in a closed‐world view with no explicit end date—they are taken as current members):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?membershipStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel. }
  
  ?person :hasUnionMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :memberOf :UnionOfMaleNurses .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
  
  FILTER ( xsd:date(?membershipStartDate) <= xsd:date("2005-01-01") )
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query you can replace :UnionOfMaleNurses with any other union of interest and "2005-01-01" with the specific point in time you wish to check.
