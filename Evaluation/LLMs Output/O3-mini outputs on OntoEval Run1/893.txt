**Yes**

Assuming a “certain union” is identified via its URI (for example, :UnionOfMaleNurses) and that a membership is considered active if its membership start date is on or before the queried point in time (with a closed‐world view since no end date is recorded), you can answer the CQ with a SPARQL query like this:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personLabel ?membershipStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :isMemberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :memberOf :UnionOfMaleNurses .  # Replace with the union of interest
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
  FILTER(?membershipStartDate <= "2005-01-01"^^xsd:date)  # Use the desired time point here
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves all persons that are members of the specified union (here, :UnionOfMaleNurses) and whose membership started on or before the given point in time (e.g. "2005-01-01").
