**Yes**

The following SPARQL query finds the persons who are union members (via a reified union membership class) for a given union at a specified point in time. In this query the date "2002-06-01" is used as the point in time. (This date can be replaced by any desired value.)

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?membership ?union ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :unionMember ?person ;
              :memberOf ?union ;
              :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  # Filter for memberships active at the specified date (e.g., 2002-06-01)
  FILTER (
    xsd:date("2002-06-01") >= ?membershipStartDate &&
    (
      !bound(?membershipEndDate) || xsd:date("2002-06-01") <= ?membershipEndDate
    )
  )
}

In this way, the CQ “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” is fully answerable by the ontology.
