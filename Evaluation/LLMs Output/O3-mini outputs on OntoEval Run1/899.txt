**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the persons (i.e. union members) who are a member of a given union (here represented by a placeholder IRI :SpecificUnionIdentifier) at a given point in time (here “2002‑06‑01” as an example). Note that we assume that union membership is recorded via a reification individual of type :Cl_PersonUnionMembership which “inherits” the person identity, and that the membership period is given by the data properties :membershipStartDate and optionally :membershipEndDate. Under the closed‐world assumption, if no end date is present then the membership is assumed to still be active.

          :membershipStartDate ?start .
  OPTIONAL { ?person :membershipEndDate ?end . }
  
  # Filter for the specific union – replace :SpecificUnionIdentifier with the actual union IRI
  FILTER (?union = :SpecificUnionIdentifier) .
  
  # Filter for a given point in time (here using 2002-06-01 as an example)
  FILTER (xsd:date("2002-06-01") >= ?start && 
         ( !bound(?end) || xsd:date("2002-06-01") <= ?end ))
  
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?person

This query shows that the competency question “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” is answerable with the ontology as the necessary reification class (:Cl_PersonUnionMembership), property (:memberOf) and period properties (:membershipStartDate and :membershipEndDate) are available to extract the answer.
