**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves theatre festivals along with the date of one of their festival occurrences (using the reification class Cl_FestivalOccurrence and its occurrenceDate data property):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :occurrenceDate ?date .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query returns the date(s) corresponding to the occurrence(s) of a given theatre festival, thus answering the CQ "When did a certain theatre festival take place?" under the closed world assumption.
