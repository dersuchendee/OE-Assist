**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology models theatre festivals using a reified occurrence (i.e. a Cl_FestivalOccurrence that carries an occurrenceDate and is connected to a Cl_TheatreFestival through the hasOccurrence property), you can write a SPARQL query to retrieve when a given theatre festival took place. For example, if you want to know when a certain festival (e.g. identified by its URI or even filtered by a label if available) occurred, you could use the query below:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :occurrenceDate ?date .
  # Optionally, if your data contains a festival name (e.g. through rdfs:label), you could filter:
  # ?festival rdfs:label "Roma Loves Shakespeare" .
}

In the closed world assumption this query will only return dates for festivals declared in the ontology, thus providing the answer to the competency question.
