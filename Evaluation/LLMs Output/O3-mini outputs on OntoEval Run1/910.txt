**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the role (with its name) that a given person holds in a specified union group at a particular point in time. Here we assume that the union membership is reified in the ontology via the Cl_UnionMembership class and that the relevant properties (hasUnionMembership, hasUnionRole, partOfUnionGroup, unionMembershipDuring along with the time properties startTime and endTime) are used to express the necessary information. In a closed‚Äêworld fashion we also assume that the absence of such triples means the person holds no such role at that time.

For example, you might parameterize the query with a specific person URI, a union group URI, and a time point (as an xsd:dateTime literal):

----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?role ?roleName
WHERE {
  # Restrict to a specific person (change URI accordingly)
  VALUES ?person { <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro> }
  
  # Restrict to a specific union group (change URI accordingly)
  VALUES ?unionGroup { <http://www.example.org/test#SomeUnionGroup> }
  
  # Define the point in time we are interested in.
  BIND("2005-01-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime AS ?timePoint)
  
  # Get the union membership instance linked to the person.
  ?person :hasUnionMembership ?membership .
  
  # Get the role that is linked with the membership.
  ?membership :hasUnionRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
  
  # Ensure this membership corresponds to the specified union group.
  ?membership :partOfUnionGroup ?unionGroup .
  
  # Get the time period during which the membership (and hence the role assignment) is valid.
  ?membership :unionMembershipDuring ?period .
  ?period :startTime ?start .
  ?period :endTime ?end .
  
  # Check that the specified time point falls within the membership period.
  FILTER(?timePoint >= ?start && ?timePoint <= ?end)
}

This query returns the role (and its name) that the specified person holds in the specified union group at the given point in time.
