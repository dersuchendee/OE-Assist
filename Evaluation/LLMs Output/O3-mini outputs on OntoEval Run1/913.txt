**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that uses the union‐related classes and properties to “ask” what role a given person has had in a given union at a particular point in time. Here we assume that the person (e.g. Pasquale Di Gennaro) is identified by his IRI and that his union membership is linked (via :memberOf) to an instance of a union group; his role is given via :hasRole (whose instances are of type :Cl_UnionRole and carry a role date via :roleDate). You can adjust the IRI values and the “given time” as parameters. Note that under the closed‐world assumption we assume the absence of additional role assignments.

  # Via the union membership we know which union group the person belongs to
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :memberOf ?unionGroup .
              
  # Filter for the specific person and union group (replace these IRIs with the actual ones)
  FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro>)
  FILTER(?unionGroup = <http://www.example.org/test#MaleNursesUnion>)
  
  # Select the role that was effective at a given point in time.
  # Here we assume a role is active if it was assigned at or before the given time.
  BIND(xsd:dateTime("2005-09-21T00:00:00") AS ?givenTime)
  FILTER(?roleDate <= ?givenTime)
}
ORDER BY ?roleDate

This query returns the person, the union role held by the person (with its assigned date), and the associated union group. Hence the CQ “What role does a certain person have within a certain union group at a certain point in time?” is answerable with the provided ontology.
