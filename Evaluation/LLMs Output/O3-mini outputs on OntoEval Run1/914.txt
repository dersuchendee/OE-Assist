**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the role a given person (e.g. :PasqualeDiGennaro) holds in a union, but only if the role’s start date is on or before a given “point in time” (which you can adjust as needed):

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?union ?roleTitle ?roleStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :hasUnionMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :memberOf ?union ;
              :hasUnionRole ?role .
  ?role :roleTitle ?roleTitle ;
        :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate .
  FILTER(?person = :PasqualeDiGennaro)
  # Only consider roles that started before or on the specified point in time:
  FILTER(?roleStartDate <= "2003-01-01"^^xsd:date)
}
ORDER BY ?roleStartDate
------------------------------------------------------------

In this query the idea is:
• We retrieve a person’s union membership (linking via :hasUnionMembership).
• For each membership we get the union (via :memberOf) and the associated role (via :hasUnionRole) along with its title and start date.
• The filter compares the role’s start date to a given date (here "2003-01-01") to simulate the “at a certain point in time” constraint.
• Under a closed‐world assumption, if there is no end date we assume the role continues from its start date onward.

This shows that the ontology models the competency question.
