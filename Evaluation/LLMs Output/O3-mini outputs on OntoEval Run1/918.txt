**Yes**

In our ontology the union membership is reified: a union membership is an instance of Cl_UnionMembership that links a person (via :unionMember) to a union (via :memberOfUnion) and also specifies the role (via :hasUnionRole) along with the date properties (e.g. :membershipStartDate and optionally :membershipEndDate). That is enough to answer the question “What role does a certain person have within a certain union group at a certain point in time?” Here is an example SPARQL query (using parameters for a given person, union and point in time) to retrieve the union role for, say, Pasquale Di Gennaro as a member of the “Union for Male Nurses” at a specified date:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :unionMember ?person ;
              :memberOfUnion ?union ;
              :hasUnionRole ?role ;
              :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate . }
  # Parameters: change these as needed
  FILTER (
         ?person = :Pasquale_Di_Gennaro &&
         ?union = :Union_Male_Nurses &&
         xsd:date("2005-01-01") >= ?membershipStartDate &&
         (
           !bound(?membershipEndDate) || 
           xsd:date("2005-01-01") <= ?membershipEndDate
         )
  )
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query returns the role of the given person in the given union if the specified date (here “2005-01-01”) falls within the membership period.
