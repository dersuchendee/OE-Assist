  BIND("2003-01-01"^^xsd:date AS ?pointTime) .
  
  # The role is considered active at ?pointTime if it started on or before ?pointTime 
  # and either has no end date or ended on or after ?pointTime.
  FILTER ( ?pointTime >= ?roleStartDate 
            && ( !BOUND(?roleEndDate) || ?pointTime <= ?roleEndDate ) )
}
