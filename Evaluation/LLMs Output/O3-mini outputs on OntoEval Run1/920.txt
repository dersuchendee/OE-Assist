**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the role that a given person (e.g. :PasqualeDiGennaro) has within a specific union (e.g. :MaleNursesUnion) that is active at a given point in time. (Here we use the date “2003-01-01” as an example of the “certain point in time”. You can change that value as needed.)

SELECT ?person ?union ?roleTitle ?roleStartDate ?roleEndDate
WHERE {
  # Find the union membership of the given person in the given union
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :membershipOf :PasqualeDiGennaro ;
              :memberOf :MaleNursesUnion ;
              :hasRole ?role .
  
  # Get the details of the union role
  ?role :roleTitle ?roleTitle ;
        :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?role :roleEndDate ?roleEndDate. }
  
  # Closed world assumption: We check that the query date falls within the role’s active period.
  FILTER (
    xsd:date("2003-01-01") >= ?roleStartDate &&
    ( !bound(?roleEndDate) || xsd:date("2003-01-01") <= ?roleEndDate )
  )
  
  BIND(:PasqualeDiGennaro AS ?person)
  BIND(:MaleNursesUnion AS ?union)
}

This query shows that the ontology supports answering the competency question “What role does a certain person have within a certain union group at a certain point in time?” by linking a person to its union membership and the associated union role (with its title and time‐period).
