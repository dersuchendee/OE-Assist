**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that answers the CQ under a closed‐world assumption. In this query we assume that union role information is modeled via the reification class :Cl_PersonUnionRole – which combines the person’s union membership with the role details (the role’s name, start date, and end date). A time parameter (?givenTime) is used to check that the role is active at the specified point in time.

  # Time filtering: the queried time (as xsd:date) must fall within the role’s period.
  # Replace "2002-01-01"^^xsd:date with the desired point in time.
  BIND("2002-01-01"^^xsd:date AS ?givenTime)
  FILTER (?givenTime >= ?roleStart && ?givenTime <= ?roleEnd)
}
ORDER BY ?person

This query retrieves, for each person (and optionally their label) the union they belong to (with its label), along with the role (its identifier and role name) and the start/end dates for the role. The FILTER ensures that only roles active at the given time (?givenTime) are returned.
