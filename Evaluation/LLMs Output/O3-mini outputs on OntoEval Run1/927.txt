Below is one possible SPARQL query that, given the IRIs of a specific doctor and a specific employee, retrieves the evaluation statement the doctor has provided for that employee:

PREFIX : <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/hospital.owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  ?doctor a :Doctor ;
          :hasEvaluation ?evaluationStatement .
  ?evaluationStatement :evaluationOf ?employee .
  
  # Replace the IRIs below with the actual IRIs for the certain doctor and employee
  FILTER (?doctor = <http://example.org/doctor/DoctorID> && ?employee = <http://example.org/employee/EmployeeID>)
}
