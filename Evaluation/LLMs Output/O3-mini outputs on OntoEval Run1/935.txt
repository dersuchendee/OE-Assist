Below is one example SPARQL query that retrieves an evaluation statement given by a specific doctor for a specific employee. (In this query the two individuals are represented by placeholder IRIs – in an actual query replace these with the appropriate URIs.)

SELECT ?employee ?doctor ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  ?employee a :Cl_Employee .
  ?employee :evaluatedBy ?evaluation .
  ?evaluation a :Cl_Evaluation .
  ?evaluation :doctor ?doctor .
  ?evaluation :evaluationStatement ?evaluationStatement .
  
  # Filter to a certain employee and a certain doctor (replace these IRIs as needed)
  FILTER(?employee = <http://www.example.org/test#Employee123> &&
         ?doctor   = <http://www.example.org/test#DoctorXYZ>)
}

This query extracts the evaluation statement from the evaluation instance for the specified employee and doctor, thereby fully answering the competency question under the closed world assumption.
