**Yes**

We can retrieve an evaluation statement between a given doctor and a given employee because the ontology provides a reified evaluation statement (an instance of Cl_EvaluationStatement) that is linked from a doctor (via :hasEvaluationStatement) and further related to an employee (via :evaluates). Under the closed‐world assumption we assume that if no such statement is present then the answer is empty. For a specific doctor and employee the following SPARQL query will extract the answer:

SELECT ?doctor ?evaluationText ?evaluationDate ?employee
WHERE {
  ?doctor a :Cl_Doctor ;
          :hasEvaluationStatement ?eval .
  ?eval :evaluationText ?evaluationText ;
        :evaluationDate ?evaluationDate ;
        :evaluates ?employee .
  # You can restrict to specific individuals if needed:
  FILTER(?doctor = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificDoctorIRI> &&
         ?employee = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificEmployeeIRI>)
}
------------------------------------

This query answers the CQ “What is the evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee?” by extracting the evaluation text and date (i.e. the evaluation statement) for that pair.
