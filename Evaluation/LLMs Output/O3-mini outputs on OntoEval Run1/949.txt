**Yes**

Because the ontology clearly models article collections as either books or CDs that are composed of articles using the object property op_composedOf, the competency question is fully answerable under a closed world assumption. For any specific book or CD (an instance of either Cl_Book or Cl_CD), you can retrieve its associated articles by following the op_composedOf relation.

For instance, the following SPARQL query retrieves the title of a specific book or CD (e.g. one provided as a parameter) and the titles of the articles it is composed of:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?collection ?collectionTitle ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  # The collection can be either a Book or a CD
  { ?collection a :Cl_Book }
  UNION
  { ?collection a :Cl_CD } .
  
  # Optionally retrieve its title
  OPTIONAL { ?collection :dp_hasTitle ?collectionTitle } .
  
  # Retrieve the articles it is composed of via op_composedOf
  ?collection :op_composedOf ?article .
  
  # Optionally retrieve the title of the article
  OPTIONAL { ?article :dp_hasTitle ?articleTitle } .
  
  # (Optional) Filter for a specific collection if desired; for example:
  # FILTER (?collection = :ArticleCollection_NursePractices)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query demonstrates how the competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" can be answered using the provided ontology.
