**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the occurrence date(s) for theatre festivals using the reification structure in the ontology:

————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?occurrenceDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrenceOccurrence .
  ?occurrenceOccurrence :occurrenceDate ?occurrenceDate .
  # Optionally, if you want a specific festival (e.g., "Roma Loves Shakespeare"),
  # you could add a FILTER or use rdfs:label if available:
  # ?festival rdfs:label "Roma Loves Shakespeare" .
}
ORDER BY ?occurrenceDate
————————————————————————————

This query shows that the CQ “When did a certain theatre festival take place?” is answerable via the connection between :Cl_TheatreFestival, its occurrence (:Cl_FestivalOccurrence), and the data property :occurrenceDate.
