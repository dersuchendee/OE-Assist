**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves for a given article collection instance (which is either a Book or a CD) the articles it contains:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/articlecollection#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?collection ?collectionLabel ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?collection a ?type .
  FILTER(?type IN (:Book, :CD))
  OPTIONAL { ?collection rdfs:label ?collectionLabel. }
  
  ?collection :contains ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article :hasArticleTitle ?articleTitle. }
}
ORDER BY ?collection ?articleTitle

This query answers the competency question by extracting, for any Book or CD (which are subclasses of ArticleCollection), the articles that compose it.
