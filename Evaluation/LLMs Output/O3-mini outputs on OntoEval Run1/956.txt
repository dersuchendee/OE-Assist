**Yes**

Assuming a closed world where only explicitly stated triples exist, the following SPARQL query retrieves, for a given book or CD (as indicated by its class membership in Cl_Book or Cl_CD), the articles it is composed of via the “contains” relation. (Here, :publicationTitle and :hasTitle are used to extract human‐readable titles for the publication and the article respectively.)

SELECT ?publication ?pubTitle ?article ?artTitle
WHERE {
  ?publication rdf:type ?pubType .
  FILTER(?pubType = :Cl_Book || ?pubType = :Cl_CD) .
  
  ?publication :contains ?article .
  ?publication :publicationTitle ?pubTitle .
  ?article :hasTitle ?artTitle .
}
ORDER BY ?publication

This query answers the competency question by directly extracting the articles that compose a specific book or CD, as modelled in the ontology.
