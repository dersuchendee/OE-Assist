**Yes**

Assuming that the intended modelling of a book or CD being composed of articles is captured by linking a :Cl_BookOrCD instance to an intermediate :Cl_Composition (which, by its OWL restriction, must “lead to” an article via the same property), the following SPARQL query retrieves, for a specified book or CD, the articles it is composed of. (Here we assume that a book’s composition is represented as a two‐step link: the book is related via :composedOf to a composition instance which in turn is related via :composedOf to an article.)

For example, if you want to list all books/CDs and their articles:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?book ?bookLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_BookOrCD .
  OPTIONAL { ?book rdfs:label ?bookLabel . }
  
  ?book :composedOf ?composition .
  ?composition :composedOf ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?book ?article

This query is answerable over the given ontology under a closed world assumption, and thus the CQ is fully supported.
