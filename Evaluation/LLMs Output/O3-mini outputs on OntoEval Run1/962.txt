**Yes**

We can extract the answer by leveraging the property that connects a publication with its constituent articles. In the ontology the classes :Cl_Book and :Cl_CD (which are sub‐classes of :Cl_Publication) use the object property :composedOf to link to :Cl_Article. Under the closed‐world assumption, if a specific publication (book or CD) is known (e.g., by its :publicationTitle), we can query for the articles that compose it.

For example, the following SPARQL query returns a book’s (or a CD’s) title along with the articles (and their titles) that are included in that publication:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?publication ?pubTitle ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?publication a ?pubType .
  FILTER(?pubType = :Cl_Book || ?pubType = :Cl_CD) .
  
  ?publication :publicationTitle ?pubTitle .
  ?publication :composedOf ?article .
  ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves, for any publication that is either a book or a CD, the publication title and all articles (with their titles) that make up the publication.
