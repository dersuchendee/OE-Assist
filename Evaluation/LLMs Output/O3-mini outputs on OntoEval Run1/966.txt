**Yes**

Assuming that the book or CD in question is represented by an article collection (as in the case of “Nurse practices in cancer patient care – longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals”, which is published as a book but modeled as an article collection that “containsArticle” the individual articles), we can write a query that, given the specific book‐identifier (here, for example, the article collection is associated with the book value) retrieves the articles it is composed of. Under a closed‐world reading we assume that if the book is indeed “composed” of articles then there is an article collection that “containsArticle” the articles. For example:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  # Here we assume that the article collection corresponding to the book (or CD)
  # is known. In our example, the article collection is :NursePracticesInCancerPatientCare.
  BIND(:NursePracticesInCancerPatientCare AS ?collection) .
  
  ?collection :containsArticle ?article .
  ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query returns the articles (and their titles) that are contained in the article collection linked to the specific book/CD.
