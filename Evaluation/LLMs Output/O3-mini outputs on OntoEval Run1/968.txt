**Yes**

Assuming a book or CD is an instance of :Cl_Book or :Cl_CD and that articles are linked via the property :containsArticle, you can extract the articles that compose the book/CD using the following SPARQL query (with a closed world assumption):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?bookOrCD ?article
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a ?type .
  FILTER(?type IN (:Cl_Book, :Cl_CD))
  ?bookOrCD :containsArticle ?article .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves each instance of a book or CD along with the articles it contains, answering the CQ fully.
