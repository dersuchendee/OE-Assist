Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the articles (via the reified class :Cl_Content) contained in a specific book or CD. (Replace <SPECIFIC_URI> with the URI of the book or CD of interest.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?collection ?collectionLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  # ?collection must be either a Book or a CD
  ?collection a ?type .
  FILTER(?type IN (:Cl_Book, :Cl_CD)) .
  OPTIONAL { ?collection rdfs:label ?collectionLabel . }
  
  # Select the articles (as Cl_Content reification) contained in the collection
  ?collection :containsArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }

  # Filter for the specific book or CD (adjust the URI accordingly)
  FILTER(?collection = <SPECIFIC_URI>)
}
  
ORDER BY ?article
