**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, returns the title and number of pages for a particular book (here, the book is identified by its title):

-----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?title ?pages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book ;
        :hasNumberOfPages ?pages ;
        :title ?title .
  FILTER(?title = "Nurse practices in cancer patient care – longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals")
}
-----------------------------------------------

This query uses the fact that the ontology models books as instances of :Cl_Book and associates a book with a number of pages via the functional data property :hasNumberOfPages.
