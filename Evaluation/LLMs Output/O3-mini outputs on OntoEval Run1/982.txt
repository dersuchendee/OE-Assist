Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the number of pages for books (instances of Cl_BookOrCD):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?book ?numPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_BookOrCD .
  ?book :numberOfPages ?numPages .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “How many pages does a particular book contain?” by selecting entities of type Cl_BookOrCD and returning the value of their :numberOfPages property under the closed world assumption.
