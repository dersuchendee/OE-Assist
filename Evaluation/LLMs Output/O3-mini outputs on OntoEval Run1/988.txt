**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves books (i.e. instances of classes whose hierarchy includes :Cl_Book) along with the number of pages recorded for each book:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?pages 
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :numberOfPages ?pages .
}
---------------------------------

In a closed world setting this query will return, for example, the book (such as :Book_1) with its recorded page count (e.g. 346).
