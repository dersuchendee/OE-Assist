**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that retrieves a particular book’s number of pages (here, using the book instance related to nurse practices in cancer patient care):

———————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?bookTitle ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?book :bookTitle ?bookTitle . }
  ?book :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages .
  # Assuming we are interested in the specific book,
  # e.g., NursePracticesInCancerPatientCareBook:
  FILTER(?book = :NursePracticesInCancerPatientCareBook)
}
———————————————

This query extracts the book title and the number of pages stored in the ontology, showing that the CQ “How many pages does a particular book contain?” is fully answerable.
