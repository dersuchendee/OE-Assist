**Yes**

Assuming the ontology provides book instances (of type :Cl_Book) with a data property :numberOfPages, we can answer the competency question by extracting the number of pages for a given book. For example, under the closed world assumption the following SPARQL query suffices:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Cl_Book .
  ?book :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages .
}
---------------------------------

This query returns the book (or books) and their number of pages, thereby fully addressing the competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?"
