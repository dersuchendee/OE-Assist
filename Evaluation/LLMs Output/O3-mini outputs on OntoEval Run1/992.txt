**Yes**

Assuming that books are represented as instances of :Cl_Book and that the number of pages is stored using the :pageCount data property, a SPARQL query to answer “How many pages does a particular book contain?” could be as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?book ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :pageCount ?pageCount .
  # Optionally, if the particular book is identifiable by a label, you could add:
  # ?book rdfs:label ?label .
  # FILTER(lcase(str(?label)) = "nurse practices in cancer patient care – longitudinal studies at italian hospitals")
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves all books (instances of :Cl_Book) along with their associated page count. Under the closed world assumption, if the data for the specific book exists in the ontology, this query will provide the complete answer.
