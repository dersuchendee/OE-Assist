**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that extracts the publication date for any resource that is either a Book or a CD:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/articlecollection#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?collection ?collectionLabel ?pubDate
WHERE {
  { ?collection a :Book }
  UNION
  { ?collection a :CD }
  
  OPTIONAL { ?collection rdfs:label ?collectionLabel . }
  ?collection :hasPublicationDate ?pubDate .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query assumes a closed‐world where any Book or CD in the dataset has a publication date (via the property :hasPublicationDate). Therefore, the competency question “When was a certain book or CD published?” is answerable from the ontology.
