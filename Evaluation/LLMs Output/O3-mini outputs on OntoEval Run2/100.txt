**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the location of each theatre festival (hence answering “Where did a certain festival take place?”):

——————————————
PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a theatre:TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel. }
  
  ?festival theatre:hasLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel. }
}
——————————————

This query extracts all instances of theatre festivals along with the location linked by the property theatre:hasLocation.
