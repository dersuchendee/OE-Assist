**Yes**
Below is one way to write a SPARQL query that retrieves the publication date (and optionally the title) for any resource that is either a book or a CD:

-----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?publication ?title ?pubDate
WHERE {
  {
    ?publication rdf:type :Cl_Book ;
                 :publication_date ?pubDate .
    OPTIONAL { ?publication :title ?title . }
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?publication rdf:type :Cl_CD ;
                 :publication_date ?pubDate .
    OPTIONAL { ?publication :title ?title . }
  }
}
-----------------------------------------------------

This query checks for instances of either :Cl_Book or :Cl_CD that have a :publication_date property â€“ thus modeling the competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" under a closed-world assumption, since only explicitly asserted publication dates (with their corresponding types) are retrieved.
