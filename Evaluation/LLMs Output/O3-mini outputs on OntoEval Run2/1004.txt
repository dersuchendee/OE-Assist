**Yes**

We can answer the question “When was a certain book or CD published?” using the ontology because it provides classes for books and CDs (Cl_Book and Cl_CD) along with the property :published (which links a publication to a book or CD) and the datatype property :publicationDate to capture the publication date.

For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves the publication date for every instance of a book or CD in the ontology:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?publication (?pubDate AS ?PublicationDate)
WHERE {
  {
    ?publication rdf:type :Cl_Book .
  } UNION {
    ?publication rdf:type :Cl_CD .
  }
  ?publication :published ?pubResource .
  ?pubResource :publicationDate ?pubDate .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query ensures that for any instance of a book or a CD, we extract its publication date via the linking publication resource, making the CQ answerable under a closed world assumption.
