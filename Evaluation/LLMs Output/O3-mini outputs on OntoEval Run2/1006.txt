**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the publication date for publications that are either a book or a CD:

-----------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?publication ?publicationTitle ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  {
    ?publication a :Cl_Book .
    ?publication :publicationTitle ?publicationTitle .
    ?publication :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?publication a :Cl_CD .
    ?publication :publicationTitle ?publicationTitle .
    ?publication :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
  }
}
-----------------

This query shows that the ontology provides a reified structure for publications—with classes for books and CDs, and an associated data property (:publicationDate)—which supports answering the competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" under a closed world assumption.
