**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the publication title and date for those publications whose type is either “Book” or “CD”:

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?publication ?publicationTitle ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication ;
               :publicationTitle ?publicationTitle ;
               :publicationDate ?publicationDate ;
               :publicationType ?pubType .
  FILTER(?pubType = "Book" || ?pubType = "CD")
}
----------------------------------

This query answers the CQ “When was a certain book or CD published?” by extracting the publication date (and title) for publications defined as a Book or CD.
