**Yes**

We can answer the query “When was a certain book or CD published?” by retrieving the publication date of any individual that is declared as a Book or a CD (i.e. an instance of :Cl_Book or :Cl_CD). Under the closed world assumption, only those individuals explicitly typed as one of these classes are considered.

Below is a sample SPARQL query that extracts the title and publication date of such publications:

---------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?publicationTitle ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?pub a ?type .
  FILTER(?type = :Cl_Book || ?type = :Cl_CD) .
  ?pub :publicationTitle ?publicationTitle ;
       :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
---------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology models the competency question.
