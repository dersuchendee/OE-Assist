**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the city (location) where a given theatre festival took place by joining the festival’s occurrence with the city that “has” that occurrence:

-----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            rdfs:label ?festivalLabel ;
            :hasFestivalOccurrence ?occurrence .
  
  ?city a :Cl_City ;
        rdfs:label ?cityLabel ;
        :cityHasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  
  # Replace "Roma Loves Shakespeare" with the target festival label if needed
  FILTER (LCASE(?festivalLabel) = "roma loves shakespeare")
}
-----------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “Where did a certain festival take place?” by leveraging the reified occurrence of the festival linked to a city via the property cityHasOccurrence.
