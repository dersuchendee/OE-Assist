**Yes**

Below is a sample SPARQL query that retrieves the publication date of any resource that is either a book or a CD:

---------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?item ?pubDate
WHERE {
  { ?item rdf:type :Cl_Book .
    ?item :publicationDate ?pubDate . }
  UNION
  { ?item rdf:type :Cl_CD .
    ?item :publicationDate ?pubDate . }
}
---------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question "When was a certain book or CD published?" by allowing extraction of the publication dates for individuals classified as either :Cl_Book or :Cl_CD.
