**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the publication dates for any instance representing a book or CD (i.e. those that are of type Cl_ArticleCollection):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?bookOrCD ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  ?bookOrCD :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}

This query extracts all individuals that are an instance of Cl_ArticleCollection (which in this ontology serves as a reified class connecting both Cl_Book and Cl_CD) along with their publicationDate.
