**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the publication date of a book (and, if available, a CD) from the ontology using the publication date property and the publishedAs relation:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?publication ?pubDate ?item ?itemTitle
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication ;
               :publicationDate ?pubDate ;
               :publishedAs ?item .
  {
    ?item a :Cl_Book ;
          :bookTitle ?itemTitle .
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?item a :Cl_CD ;
          :cdTitle ?itemTitle .
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query we assume that if CDs are represented in the ontology they use the class :Cl_CD and a title property (here assumed as :cdTitle), while books use the class :Cl_Book with the property :bookTitle. Under the closed‐world assumption, all necessary publication information is present in the data, so the answer to “When was a certain book or CD published?” can be entirely retrieved.
