**Yes**

Assuming that the “certain festival” (for example, “Roma Loves Shakespeare”) is represented as a resource of type :TheatreFestival and that its location is captured via the property :takesPlaceIn, a SPARQL query extracting the festival’s name and location would be as follows:

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?location ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival ;
            :hasName ?festivalName ;
            :takesPlaceIn ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationName . }
  
  # Closed-world assumption: filter for the specific festival.
  FILTER(?festivalName = "Roma Loves Shakespeare")
}
----------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology lets us retrieve the location where a given festival took place, thus the competency question is supported.
