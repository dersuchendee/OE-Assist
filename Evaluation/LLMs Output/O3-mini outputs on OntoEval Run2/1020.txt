**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the seminar and its held date from the ontology:

————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?heldOnDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :heldOnDate ?heldOnDate .
}
————————————————————————————

This query uses the available class :Cl_Seminar and its data property :heldOnDate to extract the date on which each seminar took place, thus fully answering the competency question under the closed world assumption.
