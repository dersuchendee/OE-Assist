**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given seminar (here represented with a placeholder IRI “:SpecificSeminar”), its associated seminar occurrence date and location. In our ontology a seminar occurrence is reified as an instance of :Cl_SeminarOccurrence that “relates” to a :Cl_Seminar and carries the seminar date via the property :hasDate. Under a closed world assumption the absence of alternative semantics means that a seminar’s occurrence and thus its date are answerable via this query:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?date ?location
WHERE {
  ?occurrence a :Cl_SeminarOccurrence ;
              :relatesToSeminar ?seminar ;
              :hasDate ?date ;
              :tookPlaceAt ?location .
  FILTER(?seminar = :SpecificSeminar)  # Replace :SpecificSeminar with the actual seminar IRI
}
ORDER BY ?date
-------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the date (and optional location) from the reified seminar occurrence corresponding to the “certain seminar” and shows that the CQ is fully modelled by the ontology.
