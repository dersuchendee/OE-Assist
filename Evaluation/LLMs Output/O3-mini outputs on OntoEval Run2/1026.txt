**Yes**

Assuming that seminars are represented as individuals of class :Cl_Seminar and their occurrence date is recorded via the property :seminarDate, the following SPARQL query retrieves the seminar and the date on which it took place:

--------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
--------------------------------------------

This response shows that the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" is answerable by the ontology under the closed world assumption.
