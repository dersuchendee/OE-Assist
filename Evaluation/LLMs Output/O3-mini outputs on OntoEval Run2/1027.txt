**Yes**

We can retrieve the seminar date from the ontology because seminars are modelled as instances of :Cl_Seminar with an associated :seminarDate property. For example, assuming that the seminar instance is identified (or we simply list all seminars with their dates), the following SPARQL query answers the competency question:

---------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
---------------------------------------------------

This query returns each seminar and the date it took place, thus fulfilling the CQ "When did a certain seminar take place?" under the closed world assumption.
