**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that uses the location properties defined in the ontology to retrieve the theatre (and optionally its city) where a given festival took place. For example, to check for the festival “Roma Loves Shakespeare”, you can write:

--------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :festivalName ?festivalName ;
            :takesPlaceAt ?theatre .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?festival :hasLocation ?city .
    OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
  }
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel . }
  
  FILTER (lcase(?festivalName) = "roma loves shakespeare")
}
--------------------------------------

This query shows how the festival is connected via the property :takesPlaceAt (and optionally :hasLocation) so that the answer to “Where did a certain festival take place?” is fully answerable from the ontology.
