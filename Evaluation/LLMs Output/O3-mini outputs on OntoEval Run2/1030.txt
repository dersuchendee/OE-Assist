A SPARQL query to extract the seminar date (when it took place) is shown below:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
---------------------------------

This query retrieves all individuals of type Cl_Seminar along with their associated seminar dates, which answers the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" under the closed world assumption.
