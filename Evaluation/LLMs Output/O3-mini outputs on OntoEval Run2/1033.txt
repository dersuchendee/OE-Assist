```sparql
SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
```

This query retrieves the seminar and the date on which it took place, which fully answers the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" under the closed world assumption.
