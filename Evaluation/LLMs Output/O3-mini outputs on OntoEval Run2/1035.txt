**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the seminar along with its recorded date:

---------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
---------------------------------------

In a closed world context, since the ontology explicitly provides seminar instances with their seminarDate (e.g. :SeminarInDecember2008), this query will extract the date (e.g. "2008-12-01") as required by the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?"
