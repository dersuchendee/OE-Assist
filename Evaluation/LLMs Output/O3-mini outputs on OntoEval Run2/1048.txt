**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the articles presented in a specific seminar. (Here we assume that the “certain seminar” is identified by its date—for example, a seminar held on December 1, 2008. You can adjust the FILTER criteria to match the seminar you are interested in.)

SELECT ?seminar ?article ?articleTitle ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :date ?seminarDate ;
           :hasArticle ?presentation .
  ?presentation :presentationOf ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article :title ?articleTitle. }
  FILTER(?seminarDate = "2008-12-01"^^xsd:date)
}
------------------------------------------------

This query works because the ontology models seminars (as instances of :Cl_Seminar) that have an associated presentation (using :hasArticle) and each presentation is linked to an article (via :presentationOf).
