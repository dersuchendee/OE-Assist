**Yes**
Below is one valid SPARQL query that returns each theatre festival along with the city where it was held (using the :heldIn property):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  ?festival :heldIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
} 

This query answers the competency question “Where did a certain festival take place?” by extracting, for each festival, the associated location, assuming a closed world (i.e. that the necessary assertions about festivals, their labels, and the cities they were held in are explicitly provided in the ontology).
