**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves all articles that were presented at a given seminar. (In this query you can replace the value in the FILTER condition with the identifier or label of the seminar of interest.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
  ?article :presentedIn ?presentation .
  ?presentation :seminar ?seminar .
  FILTER(?seminar = <http://www.example.org/test#Seminar1>) .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}

This query works because the ontology models a presentation of an article via the property “presentedIn” whose range is the reified seminar presentation (a subclass of Cl_Seminar). Thus, given a specific seminar, we can extract the articles that were presented there.
