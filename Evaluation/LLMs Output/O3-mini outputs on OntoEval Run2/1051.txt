**Yes**

Below is one way of writing a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption and using the reified presentation structure, returns the articles (with optional labels) that were presented in a given seminar (here assumed to have the IRI :Seminar_ID):

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
  ?article :presentedIn ?presentation .
  ?presentation :presentedIn ?seminar .
  FILTER(?seminar = :Seminar_ID)
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
---------------------------------

Explanation:
• The ontology models article presentations by reifying the presentation event as an instance of :Cl_Presentation. (Its definition includes a restriction indicating that the presentation must be “presented in” a seminar.)
• The query starts with all individuals of type :Cl_Article that are linked via the property :presentedIn to a presentation.
• It then “joins” that presentation through the same property (as specified by the reification restriction) to the actual seminar.
• The FILTER clause restricts the answer to a particular seminar (here provided as :Seminar_ID). 

Thus, the competency question “What articles were presented in a certain seminar?” is fully answerable using the ontology, and the provided query extracts the required answer.
