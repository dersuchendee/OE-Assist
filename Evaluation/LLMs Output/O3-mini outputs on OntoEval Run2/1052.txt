**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the articles (along with their titles) that were presented in a given seminar (here, we use the individual :SeminarOnNursePractices as an example):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article ;
           :articleTitle ?articleTitle ;
           :presentedIn ?presentation .
  ?presentation :presentationOf :SeminarOnNursePractices .
}

This query is answerable under the closed world assumption for the ontology provided and correctly models the competency question: “What articles were presented in a certain seminar?”
