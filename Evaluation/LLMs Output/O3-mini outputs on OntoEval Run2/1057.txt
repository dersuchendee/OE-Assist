SELECT ?seminar ?article ?articleTitle ?articleAuthor
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  FILTER (?seminar = :Seminar_1)
  
  # The articles presented are modelled as seminar articles 
  ?seminarArticle a :Cl_SeminarArticle ;
                    :presentedIn ?seminar ;
                    :articleTitle ?articleTitle ;
                    :articleAuthor ?article .
                    
  # Optionally, if you need to ensure the article is of type Cl_Article you can add:
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
}
ORDER BY ?articleTitle
