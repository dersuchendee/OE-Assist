**Yes**

Assuming that the seminar individual is linked to the hospital via the property holdsSeminar and that the hospital’s geographic location is available through the op_isLocatedIn property (with its city name provided via the dp_cityName data property), the ontology supports the CQ. Under the closed‐world assumption, you can extract the answer with a query like:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?hospital ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  # Link hospitals to the seminars they hold
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital ;
            :holdsSeminar ?seminar ;
            :op_isLocatedIn ?city .
  # Retrieve the city name (geographic location)
  ?city :dp_cityName ?cityName .
}
ORDER BY ?seminar

This query finds seminars held by hospitals and then follows the link to obtain the geographic location (city) of each hospital.
