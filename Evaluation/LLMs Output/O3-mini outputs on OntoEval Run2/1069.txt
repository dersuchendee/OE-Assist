Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the location (and associated details) where a seminar took place. This query uses the occurrence event of a seminar (modeled as :Cl_SeminarEvent) along with the properties that link the event to a seminar (:P_isOccurrenceOf) and to its location (:P_occursAt):

Under the closed world assumption the absence of explicit assertions ensures that only those seminars, events, and locations stated in the ontology are retrieved.
