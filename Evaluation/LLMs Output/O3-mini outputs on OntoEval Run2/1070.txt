**Yes**

We can answer the CQ by retrieving the seminar (an instance of :Seminar) and its associated location via the property :takesPlaceAt. Under the closed‚Äêworld assumption (i.e. only explicitly asserted facts are assumed true), the following SPARQL query extracts the place where a seminar took place:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?place ?placeLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel. }
  
  ?seminar :takesPlaceAt ?place .
  OPTIONAL { ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel. }
}
------------------------------------------------

This query returns all seminars along with their labels and the places (and their labels) where they took place.
