**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the location of a seminar by following the ontology’s modeled properties. In this ontology a seminar (of type :Cl_Seminar) is linked to a seminar location (of type :Cl_SeminarLocation) via the property :tookPlaceAt, and the actual location information is given by the property :seminarLocation on that seminar location.

SELECT ?seminar ?location
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :tookPlaceAt ?seminarLocation .
  ?seminarLocation :seminarLocation ?location .
}

This query answers the competency question “Where did a certain seminar take place?” by extracting the location from the modeled relationships.
