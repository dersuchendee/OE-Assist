**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each seminar, the location information where the seminar took place:

—————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?seminarLocation ?location
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate . }
  
  # Get the seminar location through the takesPlaceIn property
  ?seminar :takesPlaceIn ?seminarLocation .
  
  # Retrieve the underlying location (e.g., a city or specific spot)
  ?seminarLocation :location ?location .
}
—————————————

Under the closed world assumption, we assume that if a seminar’s location is not explicitly modelled via :takesPlaceIn and further via :location, then the seminar does not have a location record, so only those with explicit information will be returned.
