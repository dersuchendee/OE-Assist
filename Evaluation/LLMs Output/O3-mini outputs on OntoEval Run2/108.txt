**Yes**

We can retrieve the location of a given theatre festival using the dp_location property on the :Cl_TheatreFestival class. For example, the following SPARQL query returns each festival and its location:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :dp_location ?location .
}
------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, since the ontology explicitly states a location for each instance of :Cl_TheatreFestival (e.g., :RomaLovesShakespeare is associated with "Rome"), the competency question “Where did a certain festival take place?” is answerable.
