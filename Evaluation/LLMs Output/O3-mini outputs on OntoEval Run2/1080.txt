**Yes**

We can answer this CQ using the ontology. For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves each seminar along with its associated hospital (i.e. the location where it took place):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarLocation ?hospital .
}
