**Yes**

We can retrieve the location for a seminar using the property that relates seminars to their location. For example, using the ontology that defines a seminar class (Cl_Seminar) and a property (seminarTookPlaceAt) with range Cl_Location, we can write the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarTookPlaceAt ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}

This query will return all seminars along with their dates (if available) and the locations (and optionally the location labels) where they took place, thereby effectively answering the competency question.
