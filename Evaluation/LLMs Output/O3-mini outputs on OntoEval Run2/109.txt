**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that extracts the location where a festival took place:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :tookPlaceIn ?location .
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query works under the closed world assumption by selecting those individuals that are explicitly declared as a :Cl_TheatreFestival and have an associated :tookPlaceIn property indicating the city where the festival took place.
