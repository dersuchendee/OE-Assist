**Yes**

The ontology explicitly associates seminars with presentations (using ns1:hasPresentation) and presentations with articles (using ns1:presentedArticle). Under the closed world assumption, if a seminar does not list at least one presentation with a presented article then it is interpreted as not having any. Therefore, the following SPARQL query extracts all seminars that satisfy “at least one article is presented”:

PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs:  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?presentation ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a ns1:Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
  ?seminar ns1:hasPresentation ?presentation .
  ?presentation ns1:presentedArticle ?article .
}
ORDER BY ?seminar

This query returns all seminars that have at least one presentation with an associated article, thus confirming that the CQ is modeled by the ontology.
