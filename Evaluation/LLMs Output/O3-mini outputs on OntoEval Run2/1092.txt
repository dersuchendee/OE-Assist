**Yes**

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentedArticle ?article .
}
```

This query retrieves each seminar along with an article that was presented there. Under the closed world assumption, if a seminar appears in the data without any presented article, it would violate the intended modeling constraint that every seminar must present at least one article.
