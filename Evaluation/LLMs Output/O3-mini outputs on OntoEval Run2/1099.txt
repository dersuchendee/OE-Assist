**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for each seminar at least one article that was presented:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
  ?presentation :presentationOf ?seminar .
  ?article :presentedIn ?presentation ;
           :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
}
ORDER BY ?seminar ?seminarDate ?article
—————————————————————————————

Explanation:
1. The ontology models seminars as instances of :Cl_Seminar and imposes via OWL restrictions that each seminar must have at least one associated seminar presentation (using the property :presentationOf).
2. Articles (instances of :Cl_Article) that are presented are linked to a seminar presentation via the property :presentedIn.
3. The query thereby retrieves, for every seminar, at least one article that was presented – which answers the CQ “At least one article is always presented at each seminar.”

Under the closed world assumption, if a seminar has no article linked through this chain, it would be considered missing information. Hence, this SPARQL query demonstrates that the ontology is indeed modeling the competency question.
