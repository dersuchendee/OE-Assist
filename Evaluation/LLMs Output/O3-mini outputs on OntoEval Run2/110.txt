**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the location of a given festival by following the relationships defined in the ontology (from the festival instance via its occurrence to the associated city):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            rdfs:label ?festivalLabel ;  # if labels are defined
            :hasFestivalOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :festivalLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
  # Optionally, filter for a specific festival:
  # FILTER(?festival = :Festival_RomaLovesShakespeare)
}

This query uses the properties defined in the ontology (such as :hasFestivalOccurrence and :festivalLocation) to locate the city where the festival took place.
