**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves each seminar along with at least one associated article (via its presentation) as required by the competency question:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?seminar ?articlePresentation
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :containsPresentationOf ?articlePresentation .
  ?articlePresentation a :Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation .
  ?articlePresentation a :Cl_Article .
}
ORDER BY ?seminar
--------------------------------------------------

This query checks that every seminar instance (of type :Cl_Seminar) has at least one associated presentation (a reified instance of :Cl_SeminarArticlePresentation that is also an instance of :Cl_Article). Under a closed world assumption, this confirms that each seminar has at least one article presented, which satisfies the CQ.
