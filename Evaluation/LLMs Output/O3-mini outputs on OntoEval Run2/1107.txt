**Yes**

We can check that every seminar has at least one presented article by taking a closed‐world view. For example, the following query returns any seminar that lacks a presentation (i.e. has no :hasPresentedArticle link). Under the closed‐world assumption, an empty result set confirms that every seminar does indeed have at least one article presented.

SELECT ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?seminar :hasPresentedArticle ?article . }
}

If the above query returns no results, it shows that all seminars satisfy the competency question that “at least one article is always presented at each seminar.”
