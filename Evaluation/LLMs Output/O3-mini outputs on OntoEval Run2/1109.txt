**Yes**

The ontology includes a class Cl_Seminar along with a restriction stating that every seminar must have at least one value for the property “presentedIn” whose value is an instance of Cl_Article. For example, the restriction

  Cl_Seminar owl:equivalentClass [
    owl:onProperty :presentedIn ;
    owl:someValuesFrom :Cl_Article
  ]

ensures that every seminar is connected via :presentedIn to at least one article. Under the closed world assumption we consider that only explicitly stated triples hold.

A SPARQL query to retrieve seminars and their presented articles is:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :presentedIn ?article .
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query returns only those seminar instances that indeed have at least one article presented according to the ontology.
