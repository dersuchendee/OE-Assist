**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology is used under a closed‚Äêworld assumption (i.e. only explicitly stated facts hold), we can extract the current activity of a user with the following SPARQL query. In this ontology the reification pattern (using the pivot class Cl_BrushingTeeth as a subclass of Cl_BathroomActivity) supports the CQ "What is the user doing now?" by linking a person (Cl_Person) to a bathroom activity (via op_isDoing). For example:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?activity ?activityLabel
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :op_isDoing ?activity .
  OPTIONAL { ?activity rdfs:label ?activityLabel. }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query returns the persons and the bathroom activities (e.g., brushing teeth) they are currently doing.
