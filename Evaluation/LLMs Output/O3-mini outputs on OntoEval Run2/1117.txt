**No**

The CQ “What did the user do previously?” is not fully answerable using the current ontology because although a property (previousActivity) exists to relate one activity to another, there is no instance in the ontology that uses this property to link a current activity to a previous one. In a closed–world view, checking for a “previous activity” yields no result even though we have a user activity (brushing teeth). We can only partially answer the CQ by retrieving the activities performed by the user.

A partial SPARQL query extracting all activities performed by the user is as follows:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?activity ?activityLabel
WHERE {
  ?activity a :Activity .
  ?activity :performedBy :User .
  OPTIONAL { ?activity rdfs:label ?activityLabel. }
}

This query retrieves all user activities but does not distinguish a “previous” activity since no explicit chain (via :previousActivity) is recorded in the ontology.
