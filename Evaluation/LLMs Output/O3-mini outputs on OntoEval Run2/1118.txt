**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that uses the reified event class (Cl_BathroomEvent) and its properties to extract the time interval (op_hasTime) and the day of week (op_hasDayOfWeek) for the event in question:

SELECT ?event ?time ?dayOfWeek
WHERE {
  ?event a :Cl_BathroomEvent .
  ?event :op_hasTime ?time .
  ?event :op_hasDayOfWeek ?dayOfWeek .
}

In a closed-world interpretation, this query will return the time and day-of-week for any instance of a bathroom event (which—in the story—represents the event of brushing teeth in the bathroom on Thursday morning).
