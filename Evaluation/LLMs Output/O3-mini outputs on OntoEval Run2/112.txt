**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that uses the location‐modelled information in the ontology to “answer” a competency question such as “Where did a particular theatre festival take place?” (in this case by retrieving the festival along with its location):

---------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?location ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?festival rdf:type :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :festivalName ?festivalName .
  
  ?fl rdf:type :Cl_FestivalLocation .
  ?fl :hasFestival ?festival .
  ?fl :hasLocation ?location .
  ?location :locationName ?locationName .
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology provides the necessary classes (e.g. Cl_FestivalLocation) and properties (hasFestival, hasLocation, locationName) so that one can extract for each theatre festival its corresponding geographic location. Under the closed world assumption (i.e. assuming the available assertions fully describe the world) the competency question is fully supported by the ontology.
