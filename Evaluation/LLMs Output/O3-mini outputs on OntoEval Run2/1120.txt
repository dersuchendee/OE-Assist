**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query. Here we assume that each user instance (of type :Cl_User) is linked via :op_hasAbstractTime to an abstract time instance, and that we can use the current time (using NOW()) to determine which abstract time slot applies. Under the closed world assumption, only the known abstract times (e.g. morning defined as 06:00:00 to 10:00:00) exist.

ORDER BY ?user

This query extracts, for a given user, the abstract time period (e.g. “morning” when the start is "06:00:00" and end is "10:00:00") that currently applies.
