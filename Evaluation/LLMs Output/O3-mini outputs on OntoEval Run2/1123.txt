**No**  
The ontology only explicitly provides the user's location through the :hasLocation property. There is no property connecting the system to a geographical location, so we can only partially answer the CQ by extracting the user's location. Under the closed world assumption, if the systemâ€™s location is not defined, then it is not answerable. Here is a SPARQL query that extracts the available information:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?user ?userLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?user a :User .
  OPTIONAL { ?user rdfs:label ?userLabel. }
  ?user :hasLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel. }
}
