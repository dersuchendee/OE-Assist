**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for a given user (and time period) the event(s) that occur during the user’s free-time slot, match the prevailing weather condition, and are marked as suitable (via the :isSuitableFor relation):

PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?user ?timePeriod ?weather ?event ?eventLabel
WHERE {
  # Assume we are interested in a particular user, e.g., "John Doe"
  ?user a :User ;
        rdfs:label "John Doe" .
  
  # Get the user's calendar and free time slot (TimePeriod)
  ?user :hasCalendar ?calendar .
  ?calendar :hasFreeTimeSlot ?timePeriod .
  
  # Retrieve the weather condition of that free time period
  ?timePeriod :hasWeatherCondition ?weather .
  
  # Select events that occur during that time period
  ?event a :Event ;
         :occursDuring ?timePeriod ;
         :isSuitableFor ?user .
  
  # Optionally, retrieve event label
  OPTIONAL { ?event rdfs:label ?eventLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?event

This query harnesses the ontology's reified relations (e.g., a User’s calendar with free time slots, the associated weather conditions, and events that occur during those slots being marked as suitable for the user) to answer the competency question.
