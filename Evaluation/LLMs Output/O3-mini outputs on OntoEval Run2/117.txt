**Yes**

Assuming that the “certain festival” is identified by its URI (or can be filtered by a literal representing its name), the following SPARQL query shows how to extract the location of a theatre festival using the ontology’s :hasLocation property (with the closed world assumption):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :hasLocation ?location .
  # Optionally, restrict to the specific festival, e.g.:
  # FILTER(?festival = <http://www.example.org/test#RomaLovesShakespeare>)
}

This query retrieves the URI of the festival along with its associated location, thereby fully supporting the competency question: “Where did a certain festival take place?”
