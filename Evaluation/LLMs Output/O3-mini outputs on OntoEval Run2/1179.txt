**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves each instance of a set of bells along with the play methods applied—determining whether a set of bells is played manually, electrically, or both:

SELECT ?setOfBells
       (IF(BOUND(?manual) && BOUND(?electric), "both",
         IF(BOUND(?manual), "manually",
           IF(BOUND(?electric), "electrically", "none")
         )
       ) AS ?playMode)
WHERE {
  ?setOfBells a :SetOfBells .
  
  OPTIONAL {
    ?setOfBells :hasPlayMethod ?pmManual .
    ?pmManual a :ManualPlayMethod .
    BIND(?pmManual AS ?manual)
  }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?setOfBells :hasPlayMethod ?pmElectric .
    ?pmElectric a :ElectricPlayMethod .
    BIND(?pmElectric AS ?electric)
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------

This query gathers every instance of :SetOfBells (the basic set) and checks for associated play methods. The OPTIONAL patterns determine whether the set is played manually (by checking for an instance of :ManualPlayMethod), electrically (checking for an instance of :ElectricPlayMethod), or both—thus answering the competency question.
