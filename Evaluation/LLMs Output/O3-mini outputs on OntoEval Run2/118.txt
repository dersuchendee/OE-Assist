**Yes**

Assuming the closed‐world interpretation, the ontology models festival locations using the property :locatedIn (whose domain is :Cl_TheatreFestival and whose range is the reified location class :Cl_FestivalLocation, which in turn provides the location detail via the data property :locationCity). Hence, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the location of a festival. For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festLabel ?location ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festLabel . }
  ?festival :locatedIn ?location .
  ?location :locationCity ?city .
}

This query answers the competency question "Where did a certain festival take place?" by retrieving each festival’s location (the city) from the ontology.
