**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption and given an instance (e.g. a person whose rdfs:label is "Sophia"), retrieves the place(s) where she lived:

 
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?place ?placeLabel 
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person ;
          rdfs:label ?personLabel ;
          :hasLivedIn ?place .
  FILTER(?personLabel = "Sophia")
  OPTIONAL { ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel . }
} 

 
This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question: by filtering on the specific individual (here “Sophia”), we can extract the Place(s) that the person “lived in.”
