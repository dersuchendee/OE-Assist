**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves MeetingEvent instances where a given musician (e.g. :MusicianX) and a given performer (e.g. :PerformerY) both participated, and returns the event’s time, place, and (optionally) reason:

SELECT ?event ?time ?place ?reason
WHERE {
  ?event a :MeetingEvent .
  ?event :hasParticipant :MusicianX .
  ?event :hasParticipant :PerformerY .
  ?event :atTime ?time .
  ?event :atPlace ?place .
  OPTIONAL { ?event :hasReason ?reason }
}
------------------------------------

Using the closed-world assumption (i.e. assuming that if a meeting event isn’t recorded it never happened), this query verifies whether musician X and performer Y ever met and, if so, returns where, when, and (if available) why.
