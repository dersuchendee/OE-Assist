**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that extracts the plays featured in a given theatre festival (here illustrated for the festival "Roma Loves Shakespeare"):

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :hasName ?festivalName ;
            :hasProduction ?appearance .
  ?appearance :featuresPlay ?play .
  ?play :hasName ?playName .
  FILTER(?festival = :RomaLovesShakespeare)
}
------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
• The ontology models theatre festivals using the reified association class (:Cl_FestivalPlayAppearance) via the property :hasProduction.
• From a given festival (e.g., :RomaLovesShakespeare), the query traverses to the associated production appearance and then gets the play via the property :featuresPlay.
• Under the closed world assumption, only those triples explicitly asserted in the ontology are used, making the CQ answerable.
