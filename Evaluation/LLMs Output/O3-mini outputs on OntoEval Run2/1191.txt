**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that returns events along with an indication as to whether the event is religious or secular:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?event ?eventLabel ?eventType
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  OPTIONAL { ?event rdfs:label ?eventLabel. }
  {
    ?event a :ReligiousEvent .
    BIND("Religious" AS ?eventType)
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?event a :SecularEvent .
    BIND("Secular" AS ?eventType)
  }
}
ORDER BY ?event
--------------------------------------------------

Under the closed-world assumption, we assume that if an event is not explicitly asserted as either a ReligiousEvent or a SecularEvent, it is not returned by this query. This query directly answers the CQ "Was it a religious or a secular event?" by classifying each event instance accordingly.
