The ontology captures musicians performing in events that occur at places. For instance, a musician is linked to a performance (through :performedIn) and the performance is connected to a Place via :tookPlaceAt. Hereâ€™s a SPARQL query that extracts the places where musicians played:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?musician ?musicianLabel ?performance ?place ?placeLabel
WHERE {
  ?musician a :Musician .
  OPTIONAL { ?musician rdfs:label ?musicianLabel . }
  ?musician :performedIn ?performance .
  ?performance :tookPlaceAt ?place .
  OPTIONAL { ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?musician ?place
