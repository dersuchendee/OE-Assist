**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the level of confidence linking a particular Composition (X) with a specific Tune Family (Y):

--------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?composition ?tuneFamily ?confidence
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition .
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
  
  ?composition :hasVariantRelationship ?vr .
  ?tuneFamily :isPartOfVariantRelationship ?vr .
  
  ?vr :hasLevelOfConfidence ?confidence .
  
  # Replace :Composition_X and :TuneFamily_Y with the IRIs for composition X and tune family Y, respectively.
  FILTER (?composition = :Composition_X && ?tuneFamily = :TuneFamily_Y)
}
--------------------------

This query assumes that composition X and tune family Y are explicitly identified in the ontology (here using placeholders :Composition_X and :TuneFamily_Y) and retrieves the level of confidence (:hasLevelOfConfidence) associated with their variant relationship, thus fully answering the competency question under the closed world assumption.
