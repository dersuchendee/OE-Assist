**Yes**
Below is one example SPARQL query that follows the reified modelling in the ontology. In this query we assume that a theatre festival (an instance of Cl_TheatreFestival) is linked to one or more productions (via an object property such as :hasProduction) and that each production is in turn linked to a play (via the property :hasPlay). Also note that the plays’ names are given by the data property :hasName. For example, to retrieve the plays shown during the “Roma Loves Shakespeare” festival you could use:

################################################################################
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festivalName ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :hasName ?festivalName ;
            :hasProduction ?production .
  ?production a :Cl_TheatreProduction ;
              :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :hasName ?playName .
  
  FILTER(?festivalName = "Roma Loves Shakespeare")
}
ORDER BY ?playName
################################################################################

With the closed‐world assumption, only the plays explicitly connected (via the reification linking the festival, production, and play) will be returned, which answers the competency question.
