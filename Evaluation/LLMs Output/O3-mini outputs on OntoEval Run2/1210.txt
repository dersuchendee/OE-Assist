Below is a SPARQL query that, given a specific tune family (X) and a particular measure (Y), retrieves all compositions in that tune family along with the value of the relevant measure. (Adjust the IRIs for TuneFamilyX and MeasureY as needed.)

SELECT ?composition ?compLabel ?measureValue ?value
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition ;
               :isInTuneFamily ?tuneFamily ;
               :hasMeasureValue ?measureValue .
  OPTIONAL { ?composition rdfs:label ?compLabel . }
  
  FILTER(?tuneFamily = <http://www.example.org/test#TuneFamilyX>)
  
  ?measureValue :isMeasureOf ?measure ;
                :hasValue ?value .
  FILTER(?measure = <http://www.example.org/test#MeasureY>)
}
ORDER BY ?composition

This query extracts, for a given tune family and measure, the measure values associated with each composition. Such results can then be compared to understand the similarities and differences as intended by the CQ.
