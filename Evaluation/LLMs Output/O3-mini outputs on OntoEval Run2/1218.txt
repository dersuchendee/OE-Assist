**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that “asks” the ontology for the role specified for fungi that are, by definition, aquifer‐inhabitants. In our ontology the class Fungi is defined with two restrictions: one ensuring that any instance “occupiesHabitat” some Aquifer, and one stating that it “playsRoleIn” some BiogeochemicalCycleInAquifer. Assuming you have a reasoner or a mechanism to treat these TBox restrictions as available answer patterns under the closed world assumption, you can run the following query:

-----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>

SELECT ?role ?roleLabel
WHERE {
  # Ensure Fungi are aquifer inhabitants (i.e. have an occupiesHabitat restriction to Aquifer)
  :Fungi rdfs:subClassOf ?occRestriction .
  ?occRestriction owl:onProperty :occupiesHabitat ;
                  owl:someValuesFrom :Aquifer .

  # Retrieve the role imposed by the playsRoleIn restriction 
  :Fungi rdfs:subClassOf ?roleRestriction .
  ?roleRestriction owl:onProperty :playsRoleIn ;
                   owl:someValuesFrom ?role .
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel . }
}
-----------------------------------------------

This query returns the class (and an optional label) that represents the role that aquifer fungi have in biogeochemical cycling, which according to the ontology is “Biogeochemical Cycle in Aquifer.”
