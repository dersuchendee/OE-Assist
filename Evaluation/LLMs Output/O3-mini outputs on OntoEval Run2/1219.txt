**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that returns the Aquifer Microbes (along with an optional label) recorded in a specific aquifer environment (using a fixed URI for that environment) ordered by their summed abundance, which serves as a measure of “commonness”:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?microbe ?microbeLabel (SUM(?abundance) AS ?totalAbundance)
WHERE {
  ?occurrence a :MicrobeOccurrence ;
              :inEnvironment <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificAquiferEnvironment> ;
              :hasMicrobe ?microbe ;
              :hasAbundance ?abundance .
  OPTIONAL { ?microbe rdfs:label ?microbeLabel . }
}
GROUP BY ?microbe ?microbeLabel
ORDER BY DESC(?totalAbundance)

This query answers the competency question by selecting, for a given aquifer environment, the aquifer microbes along with their total abundance measurements (which proxy “commonness”) over all occurrences. The closed-world assumption is applied by assuming that only the explicitly asserted data in the ontology is true.
