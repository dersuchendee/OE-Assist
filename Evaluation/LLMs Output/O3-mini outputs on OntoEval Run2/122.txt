**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that uses the ontology’s properties to retrieve, for a given theatre festival, the list of plays featured in that festival:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a ns1:TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  ?festival ns1:featuredProduction ?production .
  ?production ns1:hasPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the CQ “What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?” by selecting each theatre festival, following its featured productions (using ns1:featuredProduction), and then retrieving the play associated with each production (using ns1:hasPlay).
