**Yes**

We can answer the CQ by “mining” the TBox restrictions that state that every BeechForest has a CO2 fixation pathway coming from the PrimaryCO2FixationPathway class. Under a closed‐world assumption, the query below extracts the CO2 fixation pathway defined in the restriction on the :BeechForest class:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>

SELECT ?pathway
WHERE {
  :BeechForest rdfs:subClassOf ?restriction .
  ?restriction owl:onProperty :hasCO2FixationPathway;
               owl:someValuesFrom ?pathway .
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query the CQ “What are the primary CO2 fixation pathways in forest ecosystems, specifically in beech forests?” is answered by retrieving the pathway specified on the :BeechForest class (which is the Primary CO2 fixation pathway as modelled in the ontology).
