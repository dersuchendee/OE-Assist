**No**

The current ontology only defines the involved classes and property restrictions at the TBox level but does not include the necessary reified (individual‚Äêlevel) assertions that link specific environmental condition instances with a CO2Fixation process that occurs in a GroundwaterEcosystem. Under the closed world assumption there are no individuals asserted, so although the axioms imply that any EnvironmentalCondition should (in general) influence some CO2Fixation process in a GroundwaterEcosystem, we cannot extract actual answers via SPARQL. A partial answer can be obtained with the following query, which will return instances if they are explicitly added:

----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?envCond ?envLabel ?process
WHERE {
  ?envCond a :EnvironmentalCondition .
  OPTIONAL { ?envCond rdfs:label ?envLabel . }
  ?envCond :influences ?process .
  ?process a :CO2Fixation .
  ?process :occursIn :GroundwaterEcosystem .
}
----------------------------------------

Since the ontology has not modelled environmental condition instances linked with CO2Fixation occurrences in that way, the CQ is only partially answerable.
