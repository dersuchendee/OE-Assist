**Yes**
Assuming there are individuals in the ontology defined as forms of carbon fixation, we can extract those that are explicitly declared as a FormOfCarbonFixation (and by the TBox, such processes occur in forest soils). Under a closed‚Äêworld assumption (i.e. we only consider what is explicitly asserted), an appropriate SPARQL query would be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?form ?formLabel ?soil ?soilLabel
WHERE {
  ?form a :FormOfCarbonFixation .
  OPTIONAL { ?form rdfs:label ?formLabel . }

  ?form :occursIn ?soil .
  ?soil a :ForestSoil .
  OPTIONAL { ?soil rdfs:label ?soilLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?form

This query retrieves those individuals that are explicitly typed as a FormOfCarbonFixation and that occur in an instance of ForestSoil, thereby answering the competency question.
