**Yes**

We can answer this CQ using the ontology’s TBox restrictions. In our ontology, the class :ForestSoilComposition is defined with a restriction stating that it “playsRoleIn” some process of type :CO2FixationProcess. Under the closed world assumption, we can extract this relation with the following SPARQL query:

-----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>

SELECT ?process
WHERE {
  :ForestSoilComposition rdfs:subClassOf ?restriction .
  ?restriction owl:onProperty :playsRoleIn ;
               owl:someValuesFrom ?process .
}
-----------------------------------------

This query retrieves the role (process) that :ForestSoilComposition plays—in this case, extracting :CO2FixationProcess as specified in the ontology.
