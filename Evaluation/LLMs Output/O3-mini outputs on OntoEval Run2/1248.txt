**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, computes for each hospital and each diagnosis code the number of admissions and then computes the average number of admissions (across hospitals) per diagnosis code. (If a particular diagnosis code should be provided, you can add an appropriate FILTER clause.)

# This query first computes the total admissions per hospital per diagnosis code.
# Then it aggregates these counts to derive the average admissions (across hospitals)
# for each diagnosis code.
SELECT ?diagnosisCode (AVG(?numAdmissions) AS ?avgAdmissions)
WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?hospital ?diagnosisCode (COUNT(?admission) AS ?numAdmissions)
    WHERE {
      ?hospital a :Hospital .
      ?hospital :hasAdmission ?admission .
      ?admission :hasDiagnosisCode ?diagnosisCode .
      # If you wish to focus on a specific diagnosis code, uncomment and modify the next line:
      # FILTER(?diagnosisCode = :SomeDiagnosisCode)
    }
    GROUP BY ?hospital ?diagnosisCode
  }
}
GROUP BY ?diagnosisCode

This query demonstrates that the ontology is modeled in such a way that the competency question—"How many admissions on average does each hospital report for a given diagnosis code?"—is answerable by extracting and aggregating the data as needed.
