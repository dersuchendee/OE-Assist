**Yes**

Below is one way to write a SPARQL query that, given a specified disease category, returns the hospital with the highest average length of stay:

-----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?avgLOS
WHERE {
  ?obs a :AverageLengthOfStayObservation ;
       :hasAverageLengthOfStay ?avgLOS ;
       :isObservationOfDiseaseCategory ?diseaseCategory ;
       :isObservationOfHospital ?hospital .
       
  # Replace the URI below with the specific disease category of interest
  FILTER(?diseaseCategory = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecifiedDiseaseCategory>)
  
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
}
ORDER BY DESC(?avgLOS)
LIMIT 1
-----------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
• The query selects all observations that are instances of AverageLengthOfStayObservation and obtains their average length of stay value.
• It then filters observations to those for the specified disease category.
• For each corresponding hospital (linked via :isObservationOfHospital), the query orders the results in descending order of the average length of stay.
• LIMIT 1 returns the hospital with the longest (i.e. highest) average length of stay. 

With the closed world assumption on the ontology, we assume that all individuals relevant to this query have been asserted in the knowledge base.
