**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given theatre festival, the plays that are being produced (via the production chain):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?play ?playTitle
WHERE {
  # Find the theatre festival of interest.
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :hasName ?festivalName . }

  # Retrieve the productions featured by the festival.
  ?festival :featuresProduction ?production .
  
  # Each production is associated to a play.
  ?production :productionOf ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasTitle ?playTitle . }
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?playTitle
--------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, we assume only the explicitly asserted links (such as :featuresProduction and :productionOf) are available, so this query fully addresses the competency question.
