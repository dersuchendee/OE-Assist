**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that, given a specified water quality parameter (here represented by the variable ?specifiedParam or a hard-coded URI), retrieves the monitoring sites that registered the observation along with the time the measurement was recorded.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?monitoringSite ?recordedTime
WHERE {
  ?obs a :WaterQualityObservation ;
       :observesParameter ?param ;
       :isObservationOf ?monitoringSite ;
       :recordedAtTime ?recordedTime .
  FILTER (?param = ?specifiedParam)  # Replace ?specifiedParam with the desired parameter URI or value.
}
ORDER BY ?monitoringSite ?recordedTime
```

In a concrete query, you might replace the filter with a specific URI as follows:

```sparql
FILTER (?param = <http://www.example.org/test#SomeWaterQualityParameter>)
``` 

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports the CQ under a closed world assumption, as every WaterQualityObservation is connected to a MonitoringSite, a WaterQualityParameter, and a recorded time.
