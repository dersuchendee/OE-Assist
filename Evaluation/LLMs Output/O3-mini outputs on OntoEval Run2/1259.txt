**Yes**

This competency question can be answered by the ontology, because the ontology defines a FlowMeasurement that records the quantity (via :hasQuantityValue) of a Flow at a specific time (via :hasTime). Under the closed world assumption, we assume that only the stated measurements exist.

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves each flow, the corresponding measurement time, and the quantity value for that measurement. (Replace the placeholder for the specific time as needed.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?flow ?time ?quantityValue
WHERE {
  ?flow a :Flow .
  ?flow :hasMeasurement ?measurement .
  
  ?measurement :hasTime ?time .
  ?measurement :hasQuantityValue ?quantityValue .
  
  # Filter for a specific time; replace the value below with the desired time stamp.
  FILTER(?time = "2023-10-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
ORDER BY ?flow ?time

------------------------------------------------

This query fully answers the CQ by retrieving the quantity recorded for each flow at the specified time.
