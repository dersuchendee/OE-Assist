**Yes**
Below is one example of a SPARQL query that extracts, for each theatre festival, the plays that participated (via the reification via festival production participation):

----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :participatedInFestival ?festivalParticipation .
  ?festivalParticipation :partOfFestival ?festival .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :festivalName ?festivalName . }
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?play
----------------------------------------

In this query we assume that a play is connected to a festival through a participation reification (i.e. a record of festival production participation via the property :participatedInFestival and then linked back to the festival via :partOfFestival). Under the closed world assumption, if a play has an instance of participation, then it is recorded as being “seen” during that festival.
