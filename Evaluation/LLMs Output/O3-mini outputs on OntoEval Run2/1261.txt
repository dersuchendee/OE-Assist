**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves each Material’s origin (via :hasOrigin) and follows the chain of processes (using :undergoesProcess and the transitive property path on :hasNextProcess) to provide its complete trace.

SELECT ?material ?source ?process
WHERE {
  ?material a :Material ;
            :hasOrigin ?source .
  OPTIONAL { 
    ?material :undergoesProcess ?firstProcess .
    # Follow the chain of processes via hasNextProcess (including the first process itself)
    ?firstProcess (:hasNextProcess)* ?process .
  }
}
ORDER BY ?material ?process
--------------------------------------------------

In this query:
• We select each Material and its associated Source (origin).
• We optionally traverse the process chain starting with the process the Material undergoes (if any) and following all subsequent :hasNextProcess links.
• The use of the SPARQL 1.1 property path (:hasNextProcess)* allows us to obtain the complete trace of processes linked together.
