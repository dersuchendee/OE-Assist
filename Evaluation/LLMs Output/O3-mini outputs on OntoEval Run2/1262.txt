**No**

The CQ asks for the rebound effects and added energy requirements of a material flow, but in the ontology the properties for energy requirements (hasEnergyRequirement) and rebound effects (hasReboundEffect) are defined on the Process classâ€”not on Flow. With a closed world assumption we can only extract a partial answer by linking material flows (via the Flow class) to processes that use them as input or output and then retrieving the associated energy requirement and rebound effect data.

Below is a SPARQL query to extract this partial answer:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?flow ?energyRequirement ?reboundEffect
WHERE {
  {
    ?process a :Process ;
             :hasInput ?flow .
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?process a :Process ;
             :hasOutput ?flow .
  }
  OPTIONAL { ?process :hasEnergyRequirement ?energyRequirement . }
  OPTIONAL { ?process :hasReboundEffect ?reboundEffect . }
}
ORDER BY ?flow

This query attempts to identify processes that take or produce a Flow and retrieves the associated energy requirements and rebound effects where available, thereby offering a partial answer to the CQ.
