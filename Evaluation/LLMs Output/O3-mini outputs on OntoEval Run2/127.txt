**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, returns the plays associated with each theatre festival (i.e. “what plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival”). Notice that the query assumes that a theatre festival individual is connected to its plays via the property “hasPlay” and that the necessary labels (or other distinguishing properties) are available.

  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?play

In this query the “closed‐world” assumption is enforced by assuming that the ontology contains all the necessary facts about a theatre festival’s plays.
