**Yes**

Because the ontology explicitly models mounting systems and the execution techniques they allow via the property :allowsExecutionTechnique, we can write a SPARQL query to extract, for a given mounting system (or all mounting systems), the associated execution techniques.

Below is an example query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?mountingSystem ?msLabel ?executionTechnique ?etLabel
WHERE {
  ?mountingSystem a :MountingSystem .
  OPTIONAL { ?mountingSystem rdfs:label ?msLabel . }
  
  ?mountingSystem :allowsExecutionTechnique ?executionTechnique .
  OPTIONAL { ?executionTechnique rdfs:label ?etLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?mountingSystem

This query retrieves each mounting system and its corresponding execution techniques, thus answering the CQ under the closed world assumption.
