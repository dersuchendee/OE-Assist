SELECT ?bell ?bellLabel ?weight ?height ?diameter
WHERE {
  ?bell a :Bell .
  OPTIONAL { ?bell rdfs:label ?bellLabel . }
  ?bell :hasWeight ?weight .
  ?bell :hasHeight ?height .
  ?bell :hasDiameter ?diameter .
}
ORDER BY ?bell

This query extracts, for each bell, its weight, height, and diameter as required by the competency question "Which are the measures of the bell?"
