**Yes**

Assuming that musician Z is represented by the instance :MusicianZ, the following SPARQL query retrieves the places associated with the events in which they participated (and therefore the places they visited):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?place ?placeLabel
WHERE {
  :MusicianZ a :Musician .
  :MusicianZ :participatesIn ?event .
  ?event :hasLocation ?place .
  OPTIONAL { ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?place
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question by extracting all places (and their labels, if available) from the events in which musician Z took part, as modelled in the ontology under the closed world assumption.
