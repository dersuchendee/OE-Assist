**Yes**

We can answer this CQ using the ontology since a theatre festival (instance of :Cl_TheatreFestival) is linked to plays (instances of :Cl_Play) by means of the property :features. In a closed world setting, if a festival is not linked via :features to a play, we assume it has no such play.

A possible SPARQL query is:

-----------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel. }
  ?festival :features ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?play
-----------------

This query retrieves each theatre festival together with the plays featured in it, thereby fully answering the competency question.
