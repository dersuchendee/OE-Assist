**Yes**

Assuming the closed world view (i.e. only events explicitly typed as either a ReligiousEvent or a SecularEvent are assumed to belong to that category), we can fully answer the competency question by checking an eventâ€™s membership in either subclass. For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves all events together with a label indicating whether they are religious or secular:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?event (IF(BOUND(?religious), "Religious", "Secular") AS ?eventType)
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
  { ?event a :ReligiousEvent . BIND(?event AS ?religious) }
  UNION
  { ?event a :SecularEvent }
}

This query works under a closed world assumption, since only those events explicitly asserted as either :ReligiousEvent or :SecularEvent are recognized.
