**Yes**

We can answer the CQ by retrieving any instances of a PowerRelation together with the involved persons (the superior and the subordinate) and its relation type. Under the closed world assumption, only explicitly stated PowerRelation instances are considered. For example:

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?powerRelation ?superior ?superiorLabel ?subordinate ?subordinateLabel ?relationType ?relationTypeLabel
WHERE {
  ?powerRelation a :PowerRelation .
  
  ?powerRelation :hasSuperior ?superior .
  OPTIONAL { ?superior rdfs:label ?superiorLabel . }
  
  ?powerRelation :hasSubordinate ?subordinate .
  OPTIONAL { ?subordinate rdfs:label ?subordinateLabel . }
  
  ?powerRelation :hasRelationType ?relationType .
  OPTIONAL { ?relationType rdfs:label ?relationTypeLabel . }
}
--------------------------------

This query extracts the answer to “Was there a power relation?” by listing all the power relation instances with their superior/subordinate pairs and relation types.
