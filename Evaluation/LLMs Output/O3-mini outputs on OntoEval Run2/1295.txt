**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves pairs of musicians whose time periods overlapâ€”that is, who were working at the same time:

SELECT DISTINCT ?musician1 ?musician2 ?startYear1 ?endYear1 ?startYear2 ?endYear2
WHERE {
  ?musician1 a :Musician.
  ?musician2 a :Musician.
  FILTER(?musician1 < ?musician2)   # avoid duplicate symmetric pairs

  ?musician1 :hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod1.
  ?timePeriod1 :startYear ?startYear1.
  ?timePeriod1 :endYear ?endYear1.

  ?musician2 :hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod2.
  ?timePeriod2 :startYear ?startYear2.
  ?timePeriod2 :endYear ?endYear2.
  
  # Overlapping condition: musician1's period overlaps musician2's period
  FILTER(?startYear1 <= ?endYear2 && ?startYear2 <= ?endYear1)
}
------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question by extracting the time-related details of musicians and identifying those whose working periods overlap.
