**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that returns, for each festival, the plays featured during one (or more) of its occurrences:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalOccurrence ?play ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_Festival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?festivalOccurrence .
  ?festivalOccurrence :hasPlayAppearance ?appearance .
  ?appearance :isPlayOf ?play .
  ?play :hasTitle ?playTitle .
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?festivalOccurrence ?playTitle
------------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question "What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?" by retrieving the plays (and their titles) linked to each festival occurrence via the appropriate object properties.
