**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a specific composition (X) and a specific tune family (Y), retrieves the confidence level with which X is considered a variant of Y:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?composition ?tuneFamily ?confidence
WHERE {
  ?va a :VariantAssertion ;
      :relatesComposition ?composition ;
      :relatesTuneFamily ?tuneFamily ;
      :hasConfidenceLevel ?confidence .
  FILTER(?composition = :CompositionX && ?tuneFamily = :TuneFamilyY)
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query, replace :CompositionX and :TuneFamilyY with the actual IRIs of composition X and tune family Y. This query works under the closed world assumption, meaning that only explicitly asserted VariantAssertions will be used to answer the competency question.
