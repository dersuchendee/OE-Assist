**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves all compositions that are members of a given tune family (here represented by the individual :X):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?composition ?compositionLabel
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition .
  ?composition :memberOf :X .
  OPTIONAL { ?composition rdfs:label ?compositionLabel . }
}

This query works under the closed world assumption by extracting only those compositions explicitly linked via the :memberOf property to the specific tune family :X.
