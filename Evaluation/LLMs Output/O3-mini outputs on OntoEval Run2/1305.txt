**Yes**  
Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a specific Tune Family (X) and a specific Measure Type (Y), retrieves each Composition within that family together with the corresponding measure value. Comparison of similarities or differences (e.g. by aggregating or contrasting the measure values) can subsequently be performed on the query result.

SELECT ?composition ?compositionLabel ?measure ?measureValue
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition ;
               :belongsToTuneFamily ?tuneFamily ;
               :hasMeasure ?measure .
  
  FILTER(?tuneFamily = :TuneFamilyX) .    # Replace :TuneFamilyX with the URI of the given tune family
  
  ?measure :measureType ?measureType ;
           :measureValue ?measureValue .
  
  FILTER(?measureType = :MeasureTypeY) .   # Replace :MeasureTypeY with the URI of the given measure type
  
  OPTIONAL { ?composition rdfs:label ?compositionLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?composition

In a closed world setting, if a Composition does not explicitly state a measure of the requested type, it will simply not appear in the result.
