**No**

The ontology does not provide any explicit way to determine whether a species is "rare" (for example, via an explicit property or criterion attached to species or their conservation status). Therefore, while we can extract characteristics of species from a specific aquifer (through :SpeciesAquiferCharacteristic), we cannot fully answer the CQ "What are the characteristics of rare species found in a specific aquifer?" under the closed world assumption. We can only return a partial answer that lists the species characteristics observed for that aquifer.

Below is a SPARQL query that extracts the available characteristics for observations associated with a given aquifer (replace <SPECIFIC_AQUIFER> with the aquifer identifier):

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?characteristic ?species ?conservationStatus ?habitatType ?populationTrend
WHERE {
  ?characteristic a :SpeciesAquiferCharacteristic ;
                  :locatedInAquifer <SPECIFIC_AQUIFER> ;
                  :hasSpecies ?species .
  OPTIONAL { ?characteristic :hasConservationStatus ?conservationStatus . }
  OPTIONAL { ?characteristic :hasHabitatType ?habitatType . }
  OPTIONAL { ?characteristic :hasPopulationTrend ?populationTrend . }
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query provides a partial answer by retrieving the observations linking species and aquifer along with optional details on conservation status, habitat type, and population trendâ€”but it does not filter for "rare" species because that aspect is not modelled in the ontology.
