**No**  
The ontology contains the relevant classes (CO2Fixation, EnvironmentalCondition, and their specific subclasses), but it does not explicitly link individual CO2 fixation process instances with individual environmental condition instances (so there’s no reified, instance‐level connection modeled) that would fully support answering “Which environmental conditions influence CO2 fixation in groundwater ecosystems?” under a closed world assumption. We can only partially retrieve data—if any instances were provided—using the relation defined in the TBox.

A partial SPARQL query to extract available connections is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?envCondition ?envConditionLabel
WHERE {
  ?process a :CO2Fixation ;
           :occursIn ?eco ;
           :influencedBy ?envCondition .
  FILTER(?eco = :GroundwaterEcosystem)
  OPTIONAL { ?envCondition rdfs:label ?envConditionLabel }
}

This query will return environmental conditions linked via the “influencedBy” property for any CO2Fixation process that explicitly occurs in a Groundwater Ecosystem. However, without instance-level assertions in the ontology, the answer is only partially supported.
