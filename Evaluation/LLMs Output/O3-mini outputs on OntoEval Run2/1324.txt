**No**

The ontology does not include any explicit instance data for rubisco. Therefore, under a closed‐world assumption, the CQ “What role does rubisco play in the CO2 fixation process?” cannot be answered fully with the current ontology. However, a partial SPARQL query that checks for an enzyme labelled “rubisco” (and its associated role in a CO2 fixation process) would be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?enzyme ?enzymeLabel ?role ?roleLabel ?process ?processLabel
WHERE {
  ?enzyme a :Enzyme .
  ?enzyme rdfs:label "rubisco" .
  OPTIONAL { ?enzyme rdfs:label ?enzymeLabel. }
  
  ?enzyme :hasRole ?role .
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel. }
  
  ?role :inProcess ?process .
  ?process a :CO2FixationProcess .
  OPTIONAL { ?process rdfs:label ?processLabel. }
} 

This query extracts the enzyme “rubisco” along with its associated role and the CO2 fixation process it participates in, which gives a partial answer to the CQ.
