The ontology does include a class for CarbonFixationForm with restrictions indicating that such forms "occur in" ForestSoil and "are part of" CarbonCycling. However, the CQ “What are the different forms of carbon fixation in forest soils?” expects to retrieve specific instances or reified representations of these carbon fixation forms. In this ontology none of the classes (e.g., CarbonFixationForm, ForestSoil) are connected to reified individuals (e.g., a membership or reification pattern); they are simply defined as classes with necessary restrictions. Thus, under the closed world assumption (i.e. no further individuals are assumed), the query cannot extract a complete answer and at best can only return a partial (likely empty) result.

A partial SPARQL query to attempt retrieving the carbon fixation forms (i.e. any instance explicitly declared as CarbonFixationForm that is known to occur in a ForestSoil) is:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?carbonFixationForm ?label ?soil
WHERE {
  ?carbonFixationForm a :CarbonFixationForm .
  OPTIONAL { ?carbonFixationForm rdfs:label ?label . }
  ?carbonFixationForm :occursIn ?soil .
  ?soil a :ForestSoil .
}
--------------------------------------------------

Because the ontology lacks reified individuals or explicit instances linking the forms to real-world entities, the CQ isn’t fully supported, and this query would produce only a partial answer.
