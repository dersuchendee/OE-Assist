**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that—under a closed‐world assumption—retrieves for each theatre festival all the plays that were seen. For example, in our ontology each festival has an occurrence that “hasPlayParticipation” where the property “participatedPlay” links to a play:

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?occur ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  ?festival :hasFestivalOccurrence ?occur .
  ?occur :hasPlayParticipation ?participation .
  ?participation :participatedPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
--------------------------------

This query extracts the plays associated to each theatre festival via the festival occurrences and play participations, thus fully answering the competency question.
