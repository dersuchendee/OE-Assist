**Yes**

We can answer this CQ using the provided ontology because each theatre festival instance has an associated set of plays through the property :hasPlay, and each play has its name given by the data property :playName. Under a closed world assumption, we assume that all relevant instances are fully available. For example, running the following SPARQL query will return the plays that could be seen at each festival:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :festivalName ?festivalName ;
            :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
ORDER BY ?festivalName ?playName
---------------------------------

This query extracts the theatre festival instances along with the names of the plays they feature, which directly answers the competency question "What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?"
