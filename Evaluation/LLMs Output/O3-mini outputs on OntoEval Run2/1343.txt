**Yes**

Assuming a closed-world interpretation (only explicitly stated triples hold), the following SPARQL query can answer the CQ:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?diagnosisCode ?avgAdmissions
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Hospital .
  ?hospital :hasAdmissionSummary ?summary .
  ?summary :appliesToDiagnosisCode ?diagnosisCode .
  ?summary :averageAdmissions ?avgAdmissions .
}

This query retrieves each hospital, the corresponding diagnosis code from its admission summary, and the average number of admissions for that diagnosis code, directly modeling the competency question.
