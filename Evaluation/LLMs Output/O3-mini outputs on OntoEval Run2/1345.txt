Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, extracts for each disease category the hospital (or hospitals) with the longest average length of stay:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?disease ?hospital ?maxValue
WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?disease (MAX(?value) AS ?maxValue)
    WHERE {
      ?hs a :HospitalStatistic .
      ?hs :forDiseaseCategory ?disease .
      ?hs :hasAverageLengthOfStay ?value .
    }
    GROUP BY ?disease
  }
  ?hs2 a :HospitalStatistic .
  ?hs2 :forDiseaseCategory ?disease .
  ?hs2 :hasAverageLengthOfStay ?maxValue .
  ?hs2 :recordedBy ?hospital .
}
