**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each theatre festival, the plays that have been scheduled within that festival (using the reified connection provided by the FestivalPlay construct):

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :festivalName ?festivalName .
  ?festivalPlay a :Cl_FestivalPlay ;
                :hasFestival ?festival ;
                :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
ORDER BY ?festivalName ?playName

This query extracts each festival along with its name and finds the associated play (via the :Cl_FestivalPlay reification). This shows that the CQ "What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?" is fully answerable given the modeled ontology.
