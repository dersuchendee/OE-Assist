**No**

The ontology defines ChemicalMeasurement and its associated unit via the property :hasUnit; however, it does not capture the context “in water” (e.g. no water sample, water source, or water quality indicator is modelled). In a closed world assumption, we can only extract units for chemical measurements without filtering by “water.”

A partial answer can be obtained with the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?chemicalMeasurement ?unit ?unitLabel
WHERE {
  ?chemicalMeasurement a :ChemicalMeasurement .
  ?chemicalMeasurement :hasUnit ?unit .
  OPTIONAL { ?unit rdfs:label ?unitLabel. }
}

This query returns the units associated with instances of ChemicalMeasurement.
