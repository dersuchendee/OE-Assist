**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model “sources” for a project. However, we can at least retrieve the projects (via the “isDescribedBy” relation) in which an organ is involved. This partial query lists each organ and the project that describes it.

PREFIX organs: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/>
PREFIX arco: <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/>

SELECT ?organ ?project
WHERE {
  ?organ a organs:Organ .
  ?organ arco:isDescribedBy ?project .
}
