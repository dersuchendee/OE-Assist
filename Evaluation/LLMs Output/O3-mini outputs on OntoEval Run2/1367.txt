**No**

The ontology does not model any property related to the weight of a bell. Under the closed world assumption, if a property for the weight (for example, bells:hasWeight) is not defined (or asserted) in the data, then it is not answerable. We can, however, write a partial query that retrieves all bells and attempts to retrieve a weight if such a property were present in the data.

For example:

--------------------------------
PREFIX bells: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?bell ?bellLabel ?weight
WHERE {
  ?bell rdf:type bells:Bell .
  OPTIONAL { ?bell rdfs:label ?bellLabel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?bell bells:hasWeight ?weight. }
}
--------------------------------

This query retrieves all instances of bells:Bell along with their labels and an optional weight value. Since the ontology does not include a defined property for weight, this query will likely return no weight values.
