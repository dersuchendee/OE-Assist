**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves for each theatre festival the plays associated with it (using the reified connection via the property :hasPlay and the data property :playName):

------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  ?festival :hasPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?playName
------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question "What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?" is answerable by the ontology as the necessary classes (e.g. :Cl_TheatreFestival, :Cl_Play or its reified form :Cl_FestivalPlays) and properties (e.g. :hasPlay with domain :Cl_TheatreFestival and the data property :playName) allow for retrieving the play information for each festival.
