Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, extracts for each theatre festival the plays (using the pivot class Cl_FestivalPlays with its data property playName) that could be seen at that festival:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  ?festival :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?playName
