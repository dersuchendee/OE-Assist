**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model the association (e.g., via a dedicated property such as "hasVariant") that links a composition (likely an instance of :Tune) to a TuneFamily as a “variant”. Under the closed world assumption, we cannot conclude that a composition is identified as a variant in a tune family if no such relationship is explicitly asserted.

A partial SPARQL query to inspect any linkage from a composition labeled "composition X" to any TuneFamily (using any property) might be:

PREFIX : <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/tunes/>
PREFIX core: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/core/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?property ?tuneFamily ?tuneFamilyLabel
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Tune ;
               rdfs:label "composition X" .
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
  ?tuneFamily ?property ?composition .
  OPTIONAL { ?tuneFamily rdfs:label ?tuneFamilyLabel . }
}

This query returns any property linking a TuneFamily to the composition with label "composition X". However, without a specific modelling of the variant relation, only a partial answer is possible.
