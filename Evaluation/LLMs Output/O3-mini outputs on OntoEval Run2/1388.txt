**No**

The ontology does not include any explicit property or annotation that models a variant relationship between a composition (Tune) and a tune family (TuneFamily) along with a “level of confidence” (or similar metric). Under a closed world assumption, we cannot assume any such relation exists without it being declared. Therefore, only a partial answer can be retrieved (for example, listing Tunes and their TuneFamilies if any association exists).

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves Tunes and TuneFamilies assuming an association property (here, we use a hypothetical property core:isVariantOf for illustration), but note that the confidence level is not modelled in the ontology:

-----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/tunes/>
PREFIX mm: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/music-meta/>
PREFIX core: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/core/>

SELECT ?tune ?tuneLabel ?tuneFamily ?tfLabel
WHERE {
  ?tune a :Tune .
  OPTIONAL { ?tune rdfs:label ?tuneLabel . }
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
  OPTIONAL { ?tuneFamily rdfs:label ?tfLabel . }
  # The following triple is a hypothetical connection;
  # the ontology does NOT actually specify a variant relation with confidence.
  ?tune core:isVariantOf ?tuneFamily .
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

Since the ontology does not capture the “level of confidence” for the variant relation, the CQ cannot be fully answered from the provided ontology.
