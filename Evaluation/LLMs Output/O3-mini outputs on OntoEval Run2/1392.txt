**No**

The current ontology does not explicitly model any link between a TuneFamily (or its contained Tunes) and a composer. In other words, while we can retrieve Tunes and TuneFamilies, there is no property or relation in the ontology that connects a TuneFamily to a composer. Therefore, the competency question cannot be fully answered. However, below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the Tunes and their TuneFamilies â€“ giving you a partial answer within the limits of the ontology.

  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
  OPTIONAL { ?tuneFamily rdfs:label ?tuneFamilyLabel . }
  
  # Assuming a membership relation exists (e.g., a property linking a TuneFamily to the Tunes it contains),
  # but since it is not modeled in the ontology, we provide a placeholder triple.
  ?tuneFamily ?memberProp ?tune .
  
  # No triple indicating association with a composer exists.
}
ORDER BY ?tuneFamily ?tune

Because there is no information regarding composers, this query only provides a partial answer.
