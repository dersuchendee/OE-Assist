**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query using the ontology’s classes and properties (with a closed‐world interpretation, assuming only explicitly stated triples exist) to retrieve the plays scheduled for a given theatre festival. In this query, you could filter for a specific festival (e.g., by its label):

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel. }
  ?festival :hasPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel. }
  
  # Example filter: Uncomment and adjust if you wish to restrict to a specific festival
  # FILTER(regex(?festivalLabel, "Roma Loves Shakespeare", "i"))
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query extracts each theatre festival along with its associated plays, addressing the competency question.
