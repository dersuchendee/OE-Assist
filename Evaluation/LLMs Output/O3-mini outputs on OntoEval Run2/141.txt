**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that extracts the plays (i.e. their play names) associated with theatre festivals:

-------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  ?festival :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
-------------------------------------------------------------

This query assumes that instances of theatre festivals are linked via the property :hasPlay to instances of the reified play class (:Cl_FestivalPlays) and that the play name is stored as a literal via the :playName data property.
