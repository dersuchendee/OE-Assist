**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the city where a given theatre (i.e. an individual of class Theatre) is located:

─────────────────────────────────────────────

PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?theatre ?theatreName ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreName . }
  ?theatre :hasLocation ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityName . }
}

─────────────────────────────────────────────

In this query, we assume that the ontology models a theatre’s location via the object property “:hasLocation” (which is defined to point to a :City). Hence the competency question “In what city is a certain theatre located?” is fully supported.
