**Yes**

We can extract the city (location) of a theatre from the ontology using the dp_location property on individuals of type Cl_Theatre. Under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, we assume that dp_location provides all the necessary location information. For example:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?theatre ?location
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre ;
           :dp_location ?location .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query returns each theatre with its associated city (as given by the dp_location value), thus fully answering the CQ.
