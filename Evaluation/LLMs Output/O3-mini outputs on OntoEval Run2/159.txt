**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the city name for a given theatre using the ontology’s reification of location:

-----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel . }
  
  ?theatre :locatedIn ?location .
  ?location :cityName ?cityName .
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, if a theatre does not have a linked location (and thus no recorded cityName) it will not be returned. This correctly reflects the CQ “In what city is a certain theatre located?” since only theatres with an explicitly modeled location are answerable.
