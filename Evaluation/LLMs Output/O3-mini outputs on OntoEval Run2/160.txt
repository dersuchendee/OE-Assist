**Yes**

We can retrieve the city of a given theatre using the property :locatedIn defined for instances of :Cl_Theatre. For example, the following query finds theatres along with the city they are located in (and optionally the city name):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?theatre ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :cityName ?cityName. }
} 

Under the closed world assumption, if a theatre is not linked to any city then it does not exist in the dataset. This query therefore answers the competency question: "In what city is a certain theatre located?"
