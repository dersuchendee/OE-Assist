**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, using the closed world assumption, retrieves the country for a given city (in this case, Rome):

PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a ns1:City .
  ?city ns1:isInCountry ?country .
  FILTER(?city = dbr:Rome)
}

This query shows that the ontology explicitly models the relation “is in country” for cities (with domain ns1:City and range ns1:Country), so the competency question is fully answerable.
