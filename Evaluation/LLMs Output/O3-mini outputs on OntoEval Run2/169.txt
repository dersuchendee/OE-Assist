**Yes**

Assuming the ontology uses the geo-classes and property “located in” to connect cities to countries (e.g., geo:City, geo:Country, and geo:locatedIn), the competency question “In what country is a certain city located?” is answerable under a closed world assumption. You can write a SPARQL query that retrieves the country for each city as follows:

PREFIX geo: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/geo#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?city a geo:City .
  ?city geo:locatedIn ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
}

This query answers the competency question by extracting each city and the country in which it is located, including optional labels for readability.
