**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves for each city the country in which it is located:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?cityName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :hasName ?cityName . }
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?country :hasName ?countryName . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" by returning the cities (and their names, if available) along with the country (and its name) each is related to via the :isLocatedIn property.
