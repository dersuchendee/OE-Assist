**Yes**

The following SPARQL query extracts each city (of type :Cl_City) and the country in which it is located (using the :isLocatedIn property):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query works under the closed world assumption since only explicitly stated facts (e.g. :Rome :isLocatedIn :Italy) will be returned as answers.
