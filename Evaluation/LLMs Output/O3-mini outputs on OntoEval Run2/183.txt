**Yes**

We can answer the competency question by retrieving those cities that have been linked via the “locatedIn” property to a country and then retrieving the country’s name. For example, under the closed‐world assumption, one SPARQL query to extract the desired answer is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?city ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?country .
  ?country :countryName ?countryName .
}

This query finds every instance of a city (i.e. an individual of class Cl_City) that is linked through the property “locatedIn” to an instance of a country and then retrieves the country’s name via the data property “countryName”.
