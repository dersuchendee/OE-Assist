**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the country in which a given city is located:

---------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
  
  # Optionally, if you want to restrict to a particular city, e.g., Rome, uncomment:
  # FILTER(?city = :Rome)
}
---------------------------------------

This query works under the closed world assumption; it returns a complete answer for the competency question since the ontology explicitly defines the domain (Cl_City) and the property (:isLocatedIn) linking a city to a country.
