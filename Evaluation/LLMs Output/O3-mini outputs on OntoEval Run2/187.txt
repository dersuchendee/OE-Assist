**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for each city its country using the property linking a city to its country location:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?city ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedInCountry ?location .
  ?location :countryName ?countryName .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “In what country is a certain city located?” because it retrieves cities (instances of :Cl_City) and, via the :isLocatedInCountry property (whose range is the reified country location class, :Cl_CityLocation, a subclass of :Cl_Country), obtains the country name defined by the :countryName datatype property.
