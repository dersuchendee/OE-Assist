**Yes**

Since the ontology defines productions (instances of :Cl_Production) and plays (instances of :Cl_Play) and connects them via the property :isBasedOn (with production as domain and play as range), we can extract the play that is the basis of a given production. Under a closed world assumption, we assume that no unmodelled relations exist and that the relation is complete.

A possible SPARQL query to answer the CQ is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?production ?productionLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :isBasedOn ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?production

This query retrieves each production and its associated play through the :isBasedOn property, thereby answering the competency question.
