SELECT ?production ?productionName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production ;
              :productionName ?productionName ;
              :basedOnPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
ORDER BY ?production

This query fully answers the competency question “What play is the basis of this production?” by extracting productions and their associated basis plays from the ontology under the closed world assumption.
