**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the production along with the play that forms its basis:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?prodPlay a :Cl_ProductionPlay ;
            :hasProduction ?production ;
            :hasPlay ?play .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
—————————————————————————————

This query makes use of the reified relation between a production and its play (as modelled by the class Cl_ProductionPlay and the object properties :hasProduction and :hasPlay) and therefore shows that the CQ is fully supported by the ontology.
