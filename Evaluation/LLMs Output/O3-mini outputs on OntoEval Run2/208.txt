**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that extracts, under a closed world assumption, each production (of type Cl_Production) along with the play (of type Cl_Play) on which it is based:

----------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :basedOnPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
----------------

This query shows that the CQ “What play is the basis of this production?” is modelled by the ontology since it directly uses the property :basedOnPlay linking a production (Cl_Production) to the play (Cl_Play).
