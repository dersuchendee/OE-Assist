Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the actors (members) who belong to a given ensemble at a specified point in time. (In this example the ensemble is filtered by its URI and the time point is “2009-09-10”. You can substitute these values with your own parameters.)

SELECT ?ensemble ?ensembleName ?actor ?actorName ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership .
  ?membership :membershipOf ?ensemble .
  ?membership :member ?actor .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?ensemble :hasName ?ensembleName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?actor :hasName ?actorName . }
  
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate . }
  
  # Check that the membership is active at the specified time ("2009-09-10")
  FILTER (
    ?membershipStartDate <= "2009-09-10"^^xsd:date &&
    ( !bound(?membershipEndDate) || ?membershipEndDate > "2009-09-10"^^xsd:date )
  )
  
  # Filter for the specific ensemble (replace <http://www.example.org/test#YourEnsemble> with the specific ensemble URI)
  FILTER ( ?ensemble = <http://www.example.org/test#YourEnsemble> )
}
ORDER BY ?actor

-------------------------------------------------

This query:
• Finds all instances of Cl_EnsembleMembership that link an ensemble (using the reification property membershipOf) to an actor (using member).
• Filters using the membershipStartDate and, if present, the membershipEndDate to ensure that the membership is active at the given date.
• Optionally retrieves names of the ensemble and actors.
• Uses a filter to target the specified ensemble.

Thus, the competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" is supported by the ontology via the above query.
