**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, returns the actors (members) of a given ensemble at a given point in time. In this query the ensemble is identified by its name (?ensembleName) and the time of interest is provided as a date literal (?pointTime). (You could also parameterize these depending on your application.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorName
WHERE {
  # Find a membership instance that reifies membership in an ensemble
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership ;
              :membershipOf ?ensemble ;
              :member ?actor ;
              :membershipStartDate ?start .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?end . }
  
  # Filter the ensemble by a given name
  ?ensemble :hasName ?ensembleName .
  FILTER(?ensembleName = "Your Ensemble Name")

  # Optionally retrieve the actor name if available
  OPTIONAL { ?actor :hasName ?actorName . }
  
  # The point in time for which we want members;
  # Only include those memberships that started on or before ?pointTime
  # and have no end date or ended on or after ?pointTime.
  FILTER(
    xsd:date("2020-01-01") >= ?start &&
    ( !bound(?end) || xsd:date("2020-01-01") <= ?end )
  )
}

In this query the literal "2020-01-01" represents the point in time of interest and "Your Ensemble Name" is the ensemble you are filtering on. Adjust these as needed.
