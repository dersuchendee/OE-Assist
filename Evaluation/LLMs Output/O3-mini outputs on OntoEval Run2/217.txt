**Yes**

Assuming that a specific ensemble (for example, with URI :EnsembleX) is given and that the point in time is provided as a dateTime value, the following SPARQL query retrieves the actors (members)
whose ensemble memberships (modeled by the reified class :EnsembleMembership) hold for a time interval that covers the given moment:

SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?membership ?interval ?start ?end
WHERE {
  ?membership a :EnsembleMembership ;
              :ensemble :EnsembleX ;    # Replace with the URI of the ensemble of interest
              :member ?actor ;
              :during ?interval .
  ?interval :hasStartDate ?start ;
            :hasEndDate ?end .
  
  # The given time point - supply it here (adjust the literal value as needed):
  FILTER ("2009-09-15T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime >= ?start && "2009-09-15T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime <= ?end) .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorName . }
}
ORDER BY ?actorName
------------------------------------------------

In this query we:
• Select ensemble memberships whose associated time interval (with properties :hasStartDate and :hasEndDate) includes the given time point.
• Filter the results so that only members whose membership interval covers the supplied time ("2009-09-15T00:00:00" in this example) are returned.
