**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, given a particular ensemble (identified by its URI) and a point in time (provided as a literal), returns the actors that are members of that ensemble at that time. This query assumes that each actor’s membership is represented via an instance of Cl_EnsembleMembership which is connected to the ensemble by the property membershipOf. The membership time information can be provided either as a single point (membershipAt) or as a period (membershipStart and membershipEnd). Under the closed‐world assumption the query only returns actors whose membership data is asserted in the ontology.

This query answers the CQ “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” by retrieving the actors linked via a Cl_EnsembleMembership whose time constraints (either a single timestamp or a valid period) match the given point in time.
