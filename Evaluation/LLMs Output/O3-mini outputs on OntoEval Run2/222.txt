**Yes**

Assuming that being “a member of an ensemble at a given point in time” means that an individual has an ensemble membership instance with an :atTime value exactly equal to the given time (and that the ensemble links its memberships to the respective individuals), you can answer the competency question with a query like this:

-----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?ensemble ?individual ?individualName ?time 
WHERE {
  # Select the specific ensemble of interest.
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble.
  FILTER(?ensemble = <http://www.example.org/test#MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble>) .
  
  # Link the ensemble to its members
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?individual.
  OPTIONAL { ?individual :hasName ?individualName. }
  
  # Get the membership reification which records the time information
  ?individual :hasEnsembleMembership ?membership.
  ?membership :atTime ?time.
  
  # Only include memberships that hold at the specified point in time.
  FILTER(?time = "2009-09-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
ORDER BY ?individual
-----------------------------------------------

This query returns the ensemble (here specifically the MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble), each individual member (with an optional name), and the time stamp of their membership – effectively answering “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” under the closed world assumption.
