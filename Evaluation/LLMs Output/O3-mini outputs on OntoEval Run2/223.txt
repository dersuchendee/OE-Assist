**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, for a given ensemble (here we use the example ensemble :MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble) and a chosen point in time (e.g. “2009-09-10”), returns the actors whose membership period covers that time:

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?ensemble ?actor ?dp_startDate ?dp_endDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  # For example, restrict to a specific ensemble:
  FILTER(?ensemble = :MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble) .
  
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership ;
              :op_membershipIn ?ensemble ;
              :dp_startDate ?dp_startDate ;
              :dp_endDate ?dp_endDate .
  ?actor :op_hasMembership ?membership .
  
  # Check that the given point in time falls within the membership period.
  FILTER ("2009-09-10"^^xsd:date >= ?dp_startDate && "2009-09-10"^^xsd:date <= ?dp_endDate)
}
ORDER BY ?actor

This query shows that the ontology models the concepts required by the CQ—that is, ensembles, membership (with start/end dates), and actors—and answers “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” under a closed world assumption.
