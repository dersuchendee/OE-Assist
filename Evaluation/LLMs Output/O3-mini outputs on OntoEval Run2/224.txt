**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the actors (members) of a specified ensemble at a given time. In this query the ensemble and the point in time are provided as parameters:

SELECT ?ensemble ?ensembleLabel ?actor ?actorLabel ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  # Ensure the ensemble is of the appropriate type.
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  
  # Optionally filter for a given ensemble (replace with desired URI or remove this clause to list all ensembles).
  FILTER(?ensemble = :MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble) .
  
  # Get human-readable name if available.
  OPTIONAL { ?ensemble rdfs:label ?ensembleLabel . }
  
  # Link actor to the ensemble via their membership and performance.
  ?actor :performedIn ?ensemble .
  ?actor :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :atTime ?membershipTime .
  
  # Filter for a specific point in time (for example, September 1, 2009; adjust as needed).
  FILTER(?membershipTime = "2009-09-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime) .
  
  # Optionally get actor labels.
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?ensemble ?membershipTime ?actor
-------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” by retrieving actors whose membership record carries a date matching a given time and whose performance is linked to the given ensemble.
