**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, given an ensemble and a specific date (here “2009-09-10”), returns the ensemble’s members whose membership covers that date:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?ensembleLabel ?actor ?actorLabel ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble ;
            :hasEnsembleMembership ?membership .
  OPTIONAL { ?ensemble rdfs:label ?ensembleLabel. }
  ?membership :memberActor ?actor ;
              :membershipStartDate ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEnd. }
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel. }
  
  # Filter for memberships active at the chosen point in time 
  FILTER (
    ?membershipStart <= "2009-09-10"^^xsd:date &&
    ( !bound(?membershipEnd) || ?membershipEnd >= "2009-09-10"^^xsd:date )
  )
}
ORDER BY ?ensemble ?actor
------------------------------------------------------------

This query uses the ensemble–membership model (with :Cl_Ensemble and :Cl_EnsembleMembership), along with start and (optionally) end dates, to answer “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” under a closed‐world assumption, so the answer is fully supported by the ontology.
