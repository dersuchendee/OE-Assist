**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each ensemble, its members along with the time period during which they are members. (For instance, you could further filter for a specific time period if needed.)

SELECT ?ensemble ?ensembleLabel ?actor ?actorName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  OPTIONAL { ?ensemble rdfs:label ?ensembleLabel . }
  
  ?ensemble :hasEnsembleMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :hasMember ?actor .
  ?membership :hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
}
ORDER BY ?ensemble ?timePeriod

This query confirms that the ontology does model the competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?" via the reified class for ensemble membership.
