**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that retrieves the members (actors) of a given ensemble at a specific time. (In this example the ensemble is provided as an individual – you can replace :Ensemble_GrandTheatre_MerchantOfVenice with any target ensemble—and the time period is filtered based on the date value.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?timePeriod 
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership ;
              :hasEnsemble :Ensemble_GrandTheatre_MerchantOfVenice ;
              :hasMember ?actor ;
              :hasTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
  FILTER (?timePeriod = "2009-09-15"^^xsd:date)
}
ORDER BY ?actorName

This query shows that the ontology supports answering the competency question “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” under a closed‐world assumption (i.e. with the data explicitly available).
