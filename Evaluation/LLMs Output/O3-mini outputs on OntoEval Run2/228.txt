**Yes**

Assuming that the “members of an ensemble at a certain point in time” are represented by instances of the reified class Cl_EnsembleMembership (which—as defined—is a subclass of Cl_Ensemble, Cl_Actor, and Cl_Date) and that ensembles relate to their memberships via the property :hasMember, here is an example SPARQL query under the closed‐world assumption. (Replace the placeholder values for the ensemble URI and the target date as needed.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?actorName ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  # Optionally restrict to a specific ensemble (replace :SpecificEnsemble with the individual URI of the ensemble)
  FILTER (?ensemble = :SpecificEnsemble)
  
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
  # Restrict to the given point in time (modify the date as required)
  FILTER(?membershipDate = "2007-01-01"^^xsd:date)
  
  ?membership :actorName ?actorName .
}
