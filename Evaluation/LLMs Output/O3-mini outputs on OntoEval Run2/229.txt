**Yes**
Below is one example query that retrieves, for a given ensemble and a chosen point in time, the member names along with the membership date:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?ensembleLabel ?memberName ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  OPTIONAL { ?ensemble rdfs:label ?ensembleLabel . }
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership :memberName ?memberName .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
  
  # Replace the date value with the specific point in time of interest
  FILTER(?membershipDate = "2009-09-15"^^xsd:date)
}
------------------------------------------------------------

In this query the ontologyâ€™s reification pattern for ensemble membership (where :Cl_EnsembleMembership is a subclass of both :Cl_Ensemble and :Cl_Person and carries the data property :membershipDate) allows us to answer the CQ using a SPARQL query under the closed world assumption.
