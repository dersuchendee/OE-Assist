Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the persons (members) of a given ensemble whose membership is recorded by a reified membership (Cl_EnsembleMembership) and filters by a specific point in time (using the membershipDate property):

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  # Assume the target ensemble is provided as a parameter.
  BIND(<http://www.example.org/test#SomeEnsemble> AS ?ensemble)
  
  # Get the ensemble membership reification instance.
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  
  # Retrieve the actual person member.
  ?membership :member ?person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel. }
  
  # Each membership has an associated date.
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
  
  # Filter for the specific point in time (e.g., "2009-09-14").
  FILTER (?membershipDate = "2009-09-14"^^xsd:date)
}
ORDER BY ?person
--------------------------------

In this query, we assume that the specific ensemble is identified by <http://www.example.org/test#SomeEnsemble> and that the membershipDate property indicates when the membership is valid (under a closed world assumption). Adjust the ensemble IRI and date literal as needed for your application.
