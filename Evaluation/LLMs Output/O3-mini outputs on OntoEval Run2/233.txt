**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that returns the names of the ensemble members along with their membership dates for a given ensemble (identified by its URI) and filtered by a specified date. You may replace ?givenDate with the desired date value.

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?memberName ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  FILTER(?ensemble = <http://www.example.org/test#YourEnsembleURI>) .
  
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership :memberName ?memberName .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
  
  FILTER(?membershipDate = "2009-09-10"^^xsd:date)  # Replace with the chosen point in time
}
------------------------------------------------

This query exploits the reification pattern provided by the ontology (via :Cl_EnsembleMembership) so that the CQ “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” can indeed be answered.
