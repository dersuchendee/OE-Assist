**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the plays written by a given author (for instance, William Shakespeare):

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play ;
        :hasAuthor :WilliamShakespeare .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “What plays did a certain author write?” by selecting all individuals of the class Play that are connected to the specified Author (here, William Shakespeare) via the :hasAuthor property.
