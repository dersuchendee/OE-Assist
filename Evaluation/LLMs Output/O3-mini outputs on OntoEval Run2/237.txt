**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves, for every author, the plays they wrote using the ns1:wrotePlay property:

PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?author ?authorName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?author a ns1:Author .
  ?author ns1:wrotePlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playName . }
}

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question “What plays did a certain author write?” under the closed world assumption.
