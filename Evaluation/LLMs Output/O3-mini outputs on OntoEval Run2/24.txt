**Yes**

Assuming a closed world where the ontology defines all water body types, we can answer the competency question by listing all classes that are (directly or indirectly) sub-classes of Cl_WaterBody. The following SPARQL query lists all such classes:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?waterBodyType 
WHERE { 
  ?waterBodyType rdfs:subClassOf* :Cl_WaterBody .
}
ORDER BY ?waterBodyType
