Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption (i.e. only plays explicitly linked to an author are returned), retrieves all plays written by a given author. (Replace the IRI provided for the author with the IRI of the author of interest.)

PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?title
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play ;
        :hasAuthor ?author .
  ?author rdfs:label "William Shakespeare" .   # Replace with the target author label or use their IRI
  
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasTitle ?title . } 
}
