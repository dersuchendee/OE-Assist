**Yes**

We can answer the CQ using the ontology because a certain author (an instance of Cl_Author) is linked to plays (instances of Cl_Play) via the property :wrote. For example, if we want to retrieve the plays written by a specific author (say, William Shakespeare), we could write a query such as:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?author ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  ?author :wrote ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  FILTER(?author = :WilliamShakespeare)
}

This query extracts the plays written by the specified author assuming the individual representing William Shakespeare is available as :WilliamShakespeare in the ontology.
