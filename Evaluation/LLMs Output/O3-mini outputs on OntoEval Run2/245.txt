**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the plays written by a given author (for example, with the name "William Shakespeare"):

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?title 
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author ;
          :hasName "William Shakespeare" ;
          :wrotePlay ?play .
  ?play :hasTitle ?title .
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “What plays did a certain author write?” by using the ontology’s class :Cl_Author and the property :wrotePlay to connect the author to the plays, and then retrieves each play’s title via the :hasTitle property.
