**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, given a particular author (e.g. William Shakespeare), retrieves the plays written by that author:

------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  :Author_WilliamShakespeare :hasAuthorPlay ?authorPlay .
  ?authorPlay :writtenPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel. }
}
------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology fully supports the CQ “What plays did a certain author write?” under the closed world assumption.
