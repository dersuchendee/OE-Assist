**Yes**

The ontology models the competency question. We can query for the plays that a given author (e.g. “William Shakespeare”) wrote using the following SPARQL query:

----------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?authorName ?playName
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author ;
          :authorName ?authorName ;
          :wrotePlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
  FILTER(?authorName = "William Shakespeare")
}
----------------------------

This query retrieves the plays written by the author “William Shakespeare” as modeled in the ontology under the property :wrotePlay.
