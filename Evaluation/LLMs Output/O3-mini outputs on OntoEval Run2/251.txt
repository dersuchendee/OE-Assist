**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the plays written by a given author (e.g. “William Shakespeare”) using the reified authorship relation in the ontology:

—————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?authorName ?playName
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author ;
          :authorName "William Shakespeare" ;
          :wrotePlay ?authorship .
  
  ?authorship a :Cl_Authorship ;
              :playName ?playName .
              
  # Closed-World: Only instances explicitly asserted are considered
}
—————

In this query the reified class :Cl_Authorship connects an author (of type :Cl_Author with an :authorName) to the play produced (whose label is provided by the data property :playName).
