**Yes**

We can answer the CQ because the ontology models authors and the plays they have written through the reification class :Cl_Authorship. In the ontology, an instance of :Cl_Author is linked via the object property :hasWritten to an instance of :Cl_Authorship, which in turn (being a subclass of both :Cl_Author and :Cl_Play) carries the data property :playTitle. Using the closed world assumption, we assume that if a given author is not linked via :hasWritten, then they have not written any plays. Thus, the following SPARQL query will return—for each author—the plays they have written:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?author ?authorLabel ?playTitle 
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorLabel . }
  ?author :hasWritten ?authorship .
  ?authorship :playTitle ?playTitle .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query extracts each author along with the title of the plays written as stored in the ontology.
