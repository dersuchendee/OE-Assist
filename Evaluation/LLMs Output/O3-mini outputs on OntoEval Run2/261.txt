**Yes**

We can answer the CQ “During what time period was a certain play written?” using the ontology’s modelling of plays and their associated time periods. In the ontology, a play (e.g. theatre:MerchantOfVenice) is linked via the property theatre:hasTimePeriod to a time period instance (e.g. theatre:TimePeriod1596-1598) that provides the start and end dates (using theatre:hasStartDate and theatre:hasEndDate). Under a closed world assumption the absence of other time period information means we can extract the complete answer.

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the time period (start and end dates) during which a given play was written:

------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?play theatre:hasTimePeriod ?tp .
  ?tp theatre:hasStartDate ?startDate .
  ?tp theatre:hasEndDate ?endDate .
  # Optionally restrict to a specific play, for example:
  FILTER( ?play = theatre:MerchantOfVenice )
}
------------------------------------------------------

This query confirms that the ontology provides the necessary structure to answer the CQ.
