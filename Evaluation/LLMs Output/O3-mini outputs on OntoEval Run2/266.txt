SELECT ?play ?writtenDuring
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?writtenDuring .
}
```

In this ontology the property :writtenDuring (with domain :Cl_Play) is used to record the time period during which a play was written. Thus, for a given play (e.g., “The Merchant of Venice”), the SPARQL query above retrieves its written period, satisfying the CQ under the closed world assumption.
