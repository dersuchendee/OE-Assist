**Yes**

We can answer the CQ “During what time period was a certain play written?” because the ontology provides a property (hasWritingPeriod) with domain Cl_Play that captures exactly that information. Assuming a closed world where only plays with an explicitly defined writing period are considered, the following SPARQL query extracts (optionally along with a play label) the writing period of each play.

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?writingPeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  ?play :hasWritingPeriod ?writingPeriod .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query returns each play along with its associated writing period, thus fully supporting the competency question.
