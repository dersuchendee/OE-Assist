**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the title of a play along with the time period during which it was written (using the :writtenDuring property):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?title ?writtenPeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :hasTitle ?title ;
        :writtenDuring ?writtenPeriod .
  # You can filter for the specific play if needed, e.g.,
  # FILTER(?title = "The Merchant of Venice")
}

This query shows that the ontology supports answering the competency question under a closed world assumption.
