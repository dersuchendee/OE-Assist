Below is an example SPARQL query that answers the CQ “What are the roles of this actor in this network?” by retrieving, for a given actor and a given network, the roles attached to the actor’s participation in that network via the circular value network participation class.

(You may supply the specific actor and network IRIs via VALUES, FILTER or by binding them using variables.)
