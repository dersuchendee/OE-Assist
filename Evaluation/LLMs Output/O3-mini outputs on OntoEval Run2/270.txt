**Yes**

We can extract the answer to the CQ “During what time period was a certain play written?” because the ontology includes a data property (writtenDuring) for the play (an instance of Cl_Play). Under the closed–world assumption, only the plays with a recorded writtenDuring value are returned. For example, to get the time period for each play that has a writtenDuring value, you could use a SPARQL query like:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?writtenDuring
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :writtenDuring ?writtenDuring .
}

This query will return, for instance, that the play “MerchantOfVenice” was written during “1596-1598.”
