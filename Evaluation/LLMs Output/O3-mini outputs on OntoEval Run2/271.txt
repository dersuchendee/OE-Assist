**Yes**

One possible SPARQL query to retrieve, for any given play, the writing period (start and end dates) is as follows:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?writingStart ?writingEnd 
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  ?play :hasWritingPeriod ?period .
  ?period :writingStartDate ?writingStart .
  ?period :writingEndDate ?writingEnd .
}
ORDER BY ?play

This query extracts each play along with its optional label and the writing period dates (start and end).
