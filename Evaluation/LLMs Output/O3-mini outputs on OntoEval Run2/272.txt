**Yes**

We can retrieve the writing time period of a play through the property :writtenDuring that links a play (instance of :Cl_Play) to its time period (instance of :Cl_TimePeriod). For example:

----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playName ?timePeriodValue
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName ;
        :writtenDuring ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :timePeriod ?timePeriodValue .
}
ORDER BY ?play
----------------------------------------------

This query returns each play, its name, and the time period value during which it was written (e.g. “1596-1598” for The Merchant of Venice).
