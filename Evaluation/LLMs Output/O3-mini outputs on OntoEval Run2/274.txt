**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each play, the corresponding time period (as recorded in the ontology by linking a play with its reified play-creation entity using the property writtenDuring and extracting the associated timePeriod data):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
  ?play :writtenDuring ?playCreation .
  ?playCreation :timePeriod ?timePeriod .
}

This query shows that the CQ ("During what time period was a certain play written?") is answerable using the provided ontology under a closed world assumption.
