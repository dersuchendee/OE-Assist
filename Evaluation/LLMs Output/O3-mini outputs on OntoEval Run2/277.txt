**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves each play together with its written time period (using the property :writtenDuring and the data property :timePeriodValue):

-----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?timePeriodValue
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  
  ?play :writtenDuring ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :timePeriodValue ?timePeriodValue .
}
ORDER BY ?play
-----------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology contains the necessary constructs to answer the CQ “During what time period was a certain play written?” under the closed world assumption.
