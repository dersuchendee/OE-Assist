**Yes**

Assuming that the intended play’s writing period is modelled by the data property “writtenDuring” on class Cl_Play, we can extract the time period in which a given play was written. For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves all plays and their “writtenDuring” value (the time period during which the play was written):

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?writtenDuring
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?writtenDuring .
}
--------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question “During what time period was a certain play written?” is fully supported by the ontology.
