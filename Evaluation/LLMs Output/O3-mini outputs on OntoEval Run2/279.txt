**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, returns each play together with the time period during which it was written (via the reified Cl_PlayCreation):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playTitle ?creationPeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :wasWrittenDuring ?playCreation .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playTitle ?playTitle . }
  ?playCreation :creationPeriod ?creationPeriod .
}

This query answers the competency question “During what time period was a certain play written?” by extracting the time period (creationPeriod) associated with each play via the :wasWrittenDuring property.
