**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves for a given play the number of acts it contains. In this example we use “The Merchant of Venice” (assuming it is identified by the individual :TheMerchantOfVenice):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?actCount
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :hasActInformation ?actInfo .
  ?actInfo :actCount ?actCount .
  FILTER(?play = :TheMerchantOfVenice)
}

This query works under the closed world assumption in our ontology, since the act count is provided via reified play act information.
