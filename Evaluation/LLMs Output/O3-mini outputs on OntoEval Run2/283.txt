**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the number of acts for plays (including a particular play if wished):

PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a ns1:Play .
  ?play ns1:numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  # To retrieve the answer for a specific play, you could uncomment and adjust the following line:
  # FILTER(?play = ns1:TheMerchantOfVenice)
}
