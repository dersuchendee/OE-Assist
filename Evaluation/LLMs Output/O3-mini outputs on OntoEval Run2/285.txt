**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the number of acts for a given play (in this case, filtering for a play whose label includes “Merchant of Venice”):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  FILTER (CONTAINS(LCASE(?playLabel), "merchant of venice"))
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query uses the ontology’s property :numberOfActs (with domain :Cl_Play) to answer the competency question “How many acts does a particular play contain?” under the closed world assumption.
