**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves each play and counts the number of acts (using the property that connects a play with its acts):

———————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playTitle (COUNT(?act) AS ?numActs)
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasTitle ?playTitle . }
  ?play :hasAct ?act .
}
GROUP BY ?play ?playTitle
ORDER BY ?play
———————————————————————————————

This query shows that the competency question “How many acts does a particular play contain?” is modeled by the ontology and answerable.
