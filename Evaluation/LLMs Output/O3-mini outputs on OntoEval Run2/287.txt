**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the act count for a given play (here “The Merchant of Venice” is assumed to be identified via its playName):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?actCount
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName "The Merchant of Venice" ;
        :actCount ?actCount .
}

An alternative query (if the ontology does not directly assert the actCount but only relates a play to its acts via the :contains property) is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?play (COUNT(?act) AS ?numActs)
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName "The Merchant of Venice" .
  ?play :contains ?act .
}
GROUP BY ?play

Both queries allow you to answer the competency question “How many acts does a particular play contain?” based on the ontology model.
