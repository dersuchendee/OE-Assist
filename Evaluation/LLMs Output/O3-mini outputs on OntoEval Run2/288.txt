**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that returns the number of acts for a given play. (In this example we assume that the particular play—for instance, “The Merchant of Venice”—is identified by the URI :TheMerchantOfVenice.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?play ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :hasNumberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
  FILTER(?play = :TheMerchantOfVenice)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology models the CQ “How many acts does a particular play contain?” as the property :hasNumberOfActs is defined with domain :Cl_Play and range xsd:integer, making the CQ answerable under the closed world assumption.
