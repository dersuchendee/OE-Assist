**Yes**

We can answer this CQ because the ontology includes a plays class (Cl_Play) and a data property (containsActs) that records the number of acts a play contains. Under the closed world assumption, we assume that if a play does not have a value for containsActs, then it does not contain any recorded value for the number of acts.

Below is a sample SPARQL query that retrieves the play (optionally with a human‚Äêreadable label) and the number of acts it contains. (You may substitute the filtering condition with a specific play URI if you wish to query a particular play.)

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?acts

  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  ?play :containsActs ?acts .

ORDER BY ?play
