**Yes**

This competency question is fully supported because the ontology explicitly provides a data property (":containsActs") on the play class (":Cl_Play") that records the number of acts a play contains. Here is an example SPARQL query that returns the play title together with the number of acts for a given play (for example, "The Merchant of Venice"):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?title ?acts
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :hasTitle ?title ;
        :containsActs ?acts .
  FILTER(?title = "The Merchant of Venice")
}
------------------------------------------------

This query works under the closed world assumption and answers the CQ “How many acts does a particular play contain?” by extracting the number of acts recorded for the specified play.
