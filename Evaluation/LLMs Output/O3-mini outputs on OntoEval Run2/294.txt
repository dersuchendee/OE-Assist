**Yes**

You can answer the question “How many acts does a particular play contain?” because the ontology represents plays (instances of :Cl_Play) that are linked via the property :hasAct to their acts (instances of :Cl_PlayAct). Under the closed‐world assumption (i.e. we assume that only those acts explicitly asserted are present), we can count the acts for a play. For example, the following SPARQL query returns each play (with its label when available) together with the number of acts linked by the :hasAct property:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel (COUNT(?act) AS ?numActs)
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  ?play :hasAct ?act .
}
GROUP BY ?play ?playLabel

This query fully answers the competency question by counting the acts for each play.
