**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves each play along with its number of acts. Note that this query assumes that for a given play there is a corresponding instance of Cl_PlayActs (reifying the play’s acts information) which relates the play to its number of acts via the property :hasNumberOfActs.

SELECT ?play ?playName ?numActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName .
  ?playAct a :Cl_PlayActs ;
           :hasPlay ?play ;
           :hasNumberOfActs ?numActs .
}

This query returns each play (instance of Cl_Play), its name, and the number of acts (from the associated Cl_PlayActs instance), thus answering the competency question: “How many acts does a particular play contain?”
