**Yes**

Assuming that each play is linked via the property :containsActs to its reified acts instance (of type :Cl_PlayActs) which in turn records the number of acts via its data property :numberOfActs, the following SPARQL query answers the CQ under the closed‚Äêworld assumption:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playName ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
  ?play :containsActs ?acts .
  ?acts :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
---------------------------------

This query retrieves each play (optionally its name, if provided) and the associated number of acts as recorded in the reified plays information.
