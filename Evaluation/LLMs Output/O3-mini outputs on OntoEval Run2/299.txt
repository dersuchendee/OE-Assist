**Yes**

Below is a sample SPARQL query that retrieves the number of acts (using the data property :numberOfActs defined on the reified play structure class :Cl_PlayStructure) along with the play's title. You could narrow the query to a specific play (e.g., “Merchant of Venice”) by adding an appropriate FILTER.

SELECT ?play ?playTitle ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_PlayStructure ;
        :playTitle ?playTitle ;
        :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
  # To restrict to a particular play, you can uncomment the following line:
  # FILTER(?playTitle = "Merchant of Venice")
}
ORDER BY ?playTitle

This query shows that the competency question “How many acts does a particular play contain?” is supported by the ontology under the closed world assumption.
