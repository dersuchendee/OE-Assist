**Yes**

The ontology models a play’s structure using the reified class Cl_PlayStructure (a subclass of Cl_Play) that is linked to a data property, numberOfActs. In other words, for plays that are modelled as instances of Cl_PlayStructure, you can extract the number of acts recorded using the property numberOfActs. For example, to get the number of acts for a particular play (e.g. “Merchant of Venice”), you could use a query like this:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playTitle ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_PlayStructure .
  ?play :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playTitle ?playTitle . }
  FILTER(?playTitle = "Merchant of Venice")
}
------------------------------------------------

This SPARQL query returns the play instance, its title, and the number of acts contained. Thus, the competency question “How many acts does a particular play contain?” is supported by the ontology.
