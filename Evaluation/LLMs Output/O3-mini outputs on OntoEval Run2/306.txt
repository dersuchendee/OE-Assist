**Yes**

Below is a sample SPARQL query that retrieves, for each theatre production, the associated premier and its date:

PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?prodLabel ?premier ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a ns1:TheatreProduction .
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?prodLabel . }
  
  ?production ns1:hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier ns1:premierDate ?premierDate .
}
ORDER BY ?production

This query answers the competency question "When was the premier of a certain production?" by extracting the productionâ€™s premier date from the ontology under a closed world assumption.
