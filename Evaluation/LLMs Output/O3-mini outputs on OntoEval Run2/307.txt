**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the premier date for a given production (here we use the production “Grand Theatre Rome Production” as the certain production referenced in the competency question):

PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd:   <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a theatre:Production .
  ?production rdfs:label ?productionLabel .
  ?production theatre:hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier theatre:hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
  
  FILTER(?production = theatre:GrandTheatreRomeProduction)
} 

This query shows that the ontology models the CQ “When was the premier of a certain production?” since it is possible to extract the premier date of the specified production.
