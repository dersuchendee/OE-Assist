**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each viewing event (i.e. an instance of :ViewingResource), the actor who was the viewer and the product (modeled as a resource) that was viewed:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actor/>
PREFIX actorODP: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actorODP/>
PREFIX resource: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/resourceODP/>

SELECT DISTINCT ?viewer ?resource
WHERE {
  ?viewing a :ViewingResource .
  ?viewing actorODP:participatingActor ?viewer .
  ?viewing actorODP:participatingResource ?resource .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question “Who viewed a product?” is fully answerable from the ontology under the closed world assumption.
