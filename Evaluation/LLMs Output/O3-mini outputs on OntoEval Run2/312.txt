**Yes**

Assuming that a “premier” event is represented using the class Cl_ProductionPremier – which connects a production (via the property premierOf) with the date of the premier (via the property premierDate) – we can answer the CQ “When was the premier of a certain production?” by writing a SPARQL query that retrieves the premiere date for a given production. (Here we assume the closed world: all relevant production premier information is completely captured in the ontology.)

For example, to extract the premier date for a production of interest (replace :YourProductionIRI with the IRI of the production), you can use the following query:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?prodPremier a :Cl_ProductionPremier ;
                 :premierOf ?production ;
                 :premierDate ?premierDate .
  FILTER(?production = :YourProductionIRI)
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the production and its unique premier date, thus demonstrating that the CQ is fully supported by the ontology.
