Below is a SPARQL query that, using a closed‐world view of the ontology, retrieves the premier date for the production based on “The Merchant of Venice”. (The production is linked to the play by the property :isBasedOn and its premier date is stored via the data property :premierDate.)

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production ;
              :premierDate ?premierDate ;
              :isBasedOn ?play .
  ?play :hasTitle "The Merchant of Venice" .
}

In this query, we first select all individuals of type :Cl_Production that have a premier date. We further restrict to those productions that are based on the play with the title “The Merchant of Venice”.
