Below is one possible SPARQL query that extracts the premier date for productions as modelled in the ontology. In this query we assume a production premier individual is related to its production by :hasProduction and its premier date by :hasPremierDate, while the name of the production is given by the data property :productionName.

SELECT ?production ?productionName ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?productionPremier a :Cl_ProductionPremier ;
                      :hasProduction ?production ;
                      :hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
}
ORDER BY ?productionName

This query shows that the competency question “When was the premier of a certain production?” is answerable from the ontology under a closed‐world assumption.
