**Yes**

The ontology records process participation using the reified participation class (actorODP:Participation) that links processes (via actorODP:participationIn) with actors (via actorODP:participatingActor). Therefore, we can answer the CQ “What are the actors involved in the process?” by querying for all participations linking an actor to a process.

Below is an example SPARQL query that under the closed world assumption returns the actors (and optionally the process they participate in):

PREFIX actor: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actor/>
PREFIX actorODP: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actorODP/>
PREFIX process: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/process/>
PREFIX processODP: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/processODP/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?actor ?actorLabel ?process ?processLabel
WHERE {
  ?participation a actorODP:Participation ;
                 actorODP:participatingActor ?actor ;
                 actorODP:participationIn ?process .
  # Filter to consider only process instances; you may adjust if both process:Process & processODP:Process are used.
  { ?process a process:Process } UNION { ?process a processODP:Process } .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?process rdfs:label ?processLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?actor ?process
