SELECT ?production ?productionLabel ?newspaper ?newspaperLabel ?ratingValue
WHERE {
  ?production a :TheatreProduction ;
              rdfs:label ?productionLabel ;
              :hasStarRating ?starRating .
  
  ?starRating :hasRatingValue ?ratingValue ;
              :givenBy ?newspaper .
  
  ?newspaper rdfs:label ?newspaperLabel .
  
  # Optionally, if you want to restrict to a particular production or newspaper, you could add a FILTER clause, e.g.:
  # FILTER(?productionLabel = "The Merchant of Venice at The Grand Theatre" && ?newspaperLabel = "Il Gazzettino")
}
ORDER BY ?production ?newspaper ?ratingValue
