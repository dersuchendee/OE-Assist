**Yes**
Assuming that the production, review, and newspaper information are represented as follows in the ontology—with a TheatreProduction having one or more associated Reviews via :hasReview, each Review having a star rating via :hasStarRating, and being linked to a Newspaper via :reviewedBy—you can extract the “star rating” given by a particular newspaper for a specific production with this query. (Replace the URIs in the FILTER clause with the specific production and newspaper of interest.)

SELECT ?production ?prodName ?review ?starRating ?newspaper
WHERE {
  ?production a :TheatreProduction .
  OPTIONAL { ?production :hasName ?prodName . }
  
  ?production :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :hasStarRating ?starRating .
  ?review :reviewedBy ?newspaper .
  
  FILTER(
      ?production = <http://example.org/theatreontology#Production1> &&
      ?newspaper  = <http://example.org/theatreontology#Newspaper1>
  )
}

Since the ontology connects productions to reviews and reviews to star ratings and newspapers, the competency question is answerable under the (closed-world) assumption.
