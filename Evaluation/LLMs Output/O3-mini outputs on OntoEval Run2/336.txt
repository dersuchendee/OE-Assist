Assuming that a “newspaper review” is modelled as an instance of :Cl_NewspaperReview (which is a subclass of :Cl_Newspaper) that links a newspaper’s review to a production via the property :reviewsProduction and carries its star‐rating via :hasStarRating, the following SPARQL query retrieves, for a given newspaper and production, the star rating:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_NewspaperReview ;
          :hasStarRating ?starRating ;
          :reviewsProduction ?production .
  ?review rdfs:label ?newspaperName .
  
  # Using a closed world assumption: We assume that only reviews with an associated 
  # label (the newspaper’s name) exist, so we filter on the desired newspaper.
  FILTER(?newspaperName = "Il Gazzettino")
  
  # Optionally, if you need to extract the rating for a specific production, 
  # you could further constrain ?production, e.g., 
  # FILTER(?production = <http://www.example.org/test#MerchantOfVeniceProduction>)
}
ORDER BY ?production ?starRating

This query shows that the ontology supports answering the competency question under a closed‐world assumption.
