Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the star rating given by a specified newspaper for a given theatre production. This query assumes a closed world where only the asserted triples exists and uses fixed identifiers for the production and newspaper (in this example, :MerchantOfVeniceProduction and :IlGazzettino). You can parameterize the production and newspaper values as needed.
