Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the star rating given by a specific newspaper (e.g. "Il Gazzettino") for a specific production (e.g. "The Merchant of Venice at The Grand Theatre"). This query makes use of the reviewRating, reviewedBy, and production-related properties provided by the ontology:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?productionName ?newspaperName ?rating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production ;
              :productionName ?productionName ;
              :hasReview ?review .
  
  ?review :reviewRating ?rating ;
          :reviewedBy ?newspaper .
  
  ?newspaper :newspaperName ?newspaperName .
  
  FILTER(?productionName = "The Merchant of Venice at The Grand Theatre" &&
         ?newspaperName = "Il Gazzettino")
}

This query shows that the competency question “What is the ‘star rating’ given by a certain newspaper for a certain production?” is fully answerable via the ontology.
