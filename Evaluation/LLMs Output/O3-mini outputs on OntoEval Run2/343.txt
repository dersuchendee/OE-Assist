**Yes**
Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the star rating given by a specified newspaper (here, "Il Gazzettino") for a production:

────────────────────────────────────────────
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :ratedBy ?rating .
  ?rating a :Cl_NewspaperRating ;
          :starRating ?starRating ;
          rdfs:label ?newspaper .
  FILTER(?newspaper = "Il Gazzettino")
}
────────────────────────────────────────────

This query is possible because the ontology provides a reification class (Cl_NewspaperRating) that links a production (via the ratedBy property) with its newspaper rating, including the starRating data property.
