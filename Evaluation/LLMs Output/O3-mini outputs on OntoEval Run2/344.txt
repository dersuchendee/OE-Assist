**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves, for each production, the star rating provided by a specific newspaper (for example “Il Gazzettino”). (Note: Under the closed‐world assumption, only those productions that explicitly have a newspaper rating will be returned.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :ratedBy ?rating .
  ?rating a :Cl_NewspaperRating .
  ?rating :starRating ?starRating .
  ?rating rdfs:label ?newspaper .
  FILTER(?newspaper = "Il Gazzettino")
}

In this query the property “ratedBy” connects a production to an instance of the reified class Cl_NewspaperRating. The data property “starRating” on that rating instance provides the star rating. The query further filters the ratings to only those given by the specific newspaper “Il Gazzettino.”
