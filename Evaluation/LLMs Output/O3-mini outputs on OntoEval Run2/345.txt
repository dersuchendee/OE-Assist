**Yes**
Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, by using the reification provided by the pivot class Cl_NewspaperReview, retrieves the star rating that a given newspaper gave for a production:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?newspaper ?newspaperLabel ?production ?productionLabel ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?newspaper a :Cl_Newspaper ;
             rdfs:label ?newspaperLabel ;
             :hasReview ?review .
  ?review a :Cl_NewspaperReview ;
          :starRating ?starRating ;
          rdfs:label ?productionLabel .
  # In this ontology the review is a reified entity that is also a production 
  BIND(?review AS ?production)
  
  # OPTIONAL filters to narrow down to a particular newspaper or production can be added.
  # For example, to select a specific newspaper and production:
  # FILTER(?newspaperLabel = "Il Gazzettino" && ?productionLabel = "Merchant of Venice")
}
ORDER BY ?newspaperLabel ?productionLabel
--------------------------------------------------

By using the object property :hasReview and the reified class :Cl_NewspaperReview (which is declared as a subclass of both :Cl_Newspaper and :Cl_Production), this query fully supports the competency question.
