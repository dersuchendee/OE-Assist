**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the star rating given by a newspaper for a production:

─────────────────────────────────────────────

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?newspaper ?production ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?newspaper a :Cl_Newspaper ;
             :publishedReview ?review .
  ?review a :Cl_Review ;
          :starRating ?starRating ;
          :reviews ?production .
  
  # Optionally, to get a “certain” newspaper or production, add FILTER clauses. For example:
  # FILTER(?newspaper = <http://www.example.org/test#IlGazzettino> && ?production = <http://www.example.org/test#SomeProduction>)
}
ORDER BY ?newspaper ?production

─────────────────────────────────────────────

With the relationships defined in the ontology—where a newspaper publishes a review (using :publishedReview), the review has a star rating (via the :starRating data property), and the review is linked to a production (through :reviews)—this CQ is answerable under the closed world assumption.
