**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves the star rating given by a newspaper for a production. In this query we assume that the production review (an instance of Cl_ProductionReview) links a production (an instance of Cl_Production) with a newspaper (an instance of Cl_Newspaper) through the properties :reviews and :reviewedBy, and that the review has a star rating via the data property :starRating.
