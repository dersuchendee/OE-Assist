**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the start date for a given actor working at a specific theatre using the reified employment information from the ontology:

----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actorName ?theatreName ?startDate
WHERE {
  # Actor with their employment period information
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor ;
         :hasName ?actorName ;
         :op_hasEmploymentPeriod ?employmentPeriod .
  
  # Employment period includes the start date and the theatre in which the actor works
  ?employmentPeriod :dp_startDate ?startDate ;
                    :op_employmentIn ?theatre .
  
  # The theatre with a name
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre ;
           :hasName ?theatreName .
  
  # (Optional: Add filters to select a specific actor and theatre)
  FILTER(?actorName = "Fabio Bianchi" && ?theatreName = "The Grand Theatre Rome")
}
----------------------------------------------------------

This query confirms that the CQ "At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?" is answerable by the ontology.
