**Yes**

Below is one way to write a SPARQL query that retrieves the start date an actor began working for a theatre, based on the employment details in the ontology:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?employment rdf:type :Cl_ActorEmployment ;
              :employment_actor ?actor ;
              :employment_theatre ?theatre ;
              :employment_start_date ?employmentStartDate .
  
  # Optionally, filter for a specific actor and a specific theatre
  # Example:
  # FILTER(?actor = :FabioBianchi && ?theatre = :TheGrandTheatre)
}
------------------------------------------------

In this query, the ontology reifies actor employment as instances of Cl_ActorEmployment that link an actor (via :employment_actor) to a theatre (via :employment_theatre) and record the starting date (via :employment_start_date). Under the closed world assumption, this query extracts the answer to the competency question:
“At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?”
