**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology includes an Employment class linking actors to theatres via properties such as :hasEmployee, :hasEmployer, and a start date property :hasStartDate, we can write a SPARQL query that retrieves the start date for a given actor at a specific theatre. For example, to get the employment start date of “Fabio Bianchi” at “The Grand Theatre”, one could use this query:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Employment ;
              :hasEmployee ?actor ;
              :hasEmployer ?theatre ;
              :hasStartDate ?startDate .
  ?actor :hasName "Fabio Bianchi" .
  ?theatre :hasName "The Grand Theatre" .
}
--------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, only the explicitly stated employment records will be returned, ensuring that the resulting start date is as recorded in the ontology.
