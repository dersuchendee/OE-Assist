**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world view, retrieves the employment start date for a given actor and theatre. (In this example the actor’s and theatre’s names are matched via rdfs:label; you can adjust the filters according to your data.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?employmentDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_ActorEmployment ;
         :worksForTheatre ?theatre ;
         :hasEmploymentDate ?employmentDate ;
         rdfs:label ?actorLabel .
  ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel .
  
  FILTER(?actorLabel = "Fabio Bianchi" && ?theatreLabel = "The Grand Theatre")
}

This query extracts the employment date for the given actor working at the specified theatre, thereby fully modelling the CQ.
