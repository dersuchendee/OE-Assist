**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the employment start date for an actor (e.g. Fabio Bianchi) working for a specific theatre (e.g. The Grand Theatre):

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?startDate ?theatre
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Individual ;
         :hasEmployment ?employment ;
         :employedBy ?theatre .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
  
  # Example filter for a given actor and theatre:
  FILTER(?actor = :FabioBianchi && ?theatre = :TheGrandTheatre)
}
---------------------------------

This query works under the closed world assumption since only explicitly asserted employment relations are returned.
