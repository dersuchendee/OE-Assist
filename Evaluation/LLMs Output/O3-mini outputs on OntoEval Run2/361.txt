**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each actor and theatre, the employment record’s starting date (i.e. when the actor started working at that theatre):

---------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :op_employmentOf ?employment .
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :op_employedAt ?theatre .
  ?employment :dp_startDate ?startDate .
}
ORDER BY ?actor ?startDate
---------------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?” by using the employment relationship (between an actor, an employment instance, and a theatre) and retrieving the start date (dp_startDate).
