**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the employment start date for an actor working at a given theatre. (You can replace the IRI values for the actor and the theatre with the appropriate ones for your query.)

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment ;
              :employmentActor ?actor ;
              :employedAt ?theatre ;
              :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel. }
  
  # For a specific actor and theatre, you can add filters. For example, if you want the employment start date for Fabio Bianchi at The Grand Theatre:
  FILTER(?actor = :Actor_FabioBianchi && ?theatre = :Theatre_GrandTheatre)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows how the ontology models the employment of an actor (using the property :employedAt and the datatype property :employmentStartDate from a :Cl_ActorEmployment instance) so that the CQ “At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?” can indeed be answered.
