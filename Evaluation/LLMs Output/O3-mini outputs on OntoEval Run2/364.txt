Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the employment start date for actors at their respective theatres:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?theatre ?theatreName ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :actorName ?actorName .
  ?actor :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  ?employment :employmentTheatre ?theatre .
  ?theatre :theatreName ?theatreName .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the actor, their name, the theatre at which they are employed, and the date when the employment started.
