**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the start date of employment for actors at theatres as modelled in the ontology:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?theatre ?theatreName ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment ;
              :hasActor ?actor ;
              :hasTheatre ?theatre ;
              :hasStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor :actorName ?actorName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre :theatreName ?theatreName . }
}
ORDER BY ?startDate
-------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the actor, theatre, and the employment start date (i.e. when a certain actor started working at a specific theatre) from the ontology, which demonstrates that the competency question is indeed supported.
