**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‑world assumption, retrieves for a given actor and theatre the employment start date using the reified employment information:

—————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor ;
         :isEmployedAt ?employment .
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment, :Cl_Theatre ;
              :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  # Optionally, add filters to select the specific actor and theatre.
  # For example:
  # FILTER(?actor = <http://www.example.org/test#FabioBianchi>)
}
ORDER BY ?actor
—————————————————————————————

In this query the employment is modelled via the reification class :Cl_Employment (which is also a subclass of :Cl_Theatre and :Cl_Date), and the data property :employmentStartDate captures the time when the actor started working at the theatre.
