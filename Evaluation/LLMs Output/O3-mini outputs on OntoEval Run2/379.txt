**No**
The ontology does not capture the temporal aspect of ensemble membership—there is no way to link an ensemble’s members to a specific point in time. Therefore the CQ “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” is only partially answerable by retrieving the current (or static) ensemble membership without any temporal filtering.

A partial SPARQL query could be:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/theatre_ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?ensemble ?ensembleLabel ?member ?memberName
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Ensemble .
  OPTIONAL { ?ensemble rdfs:label ?ensembleLabel . }
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?member .
  OPTIONAL { ?member :hasName ?memberName . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query returns the members of each ensemble but does not filter by any specific time point.
