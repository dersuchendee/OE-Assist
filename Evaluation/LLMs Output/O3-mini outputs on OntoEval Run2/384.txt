**No**

The current ontology does not provide a direct link between an individualâ€™s role assignments and a specific production. While it allows us to retrieve the roles a person holds along with their assignment times, we cannot limit these roles to those within a given production because there is no property linking a role assignment (or a role) to a production. A partial query that retrieves the roles and their assignment dates for a given person is as follows:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?role ?assignmentDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Individual .
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
  ?person :hasRoleAssignment ?assignment .
  ?assignment :assignmentDate ?assignmentDate .
  # Replace :FabioBianchi with the individual in question
  FILTER(?person = :FabioBianchi)
}
ORDER BY ?assignmentDate
