Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves—for a given person and production—the actor’s roles along with the associated time period. In the query below the class Cl_ActorRole (and its object properties :hasActor, :hasProduction, :hasRole, and :hasTimePeriod) is used to capture the reified association between an actor and a production at a given time.

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports the competency question "What roles does a certain person have within a certain production at a certain point in time?" under a closed‐world assumption, since it is possible to extract the complete answer from the ontology's reified structure.
