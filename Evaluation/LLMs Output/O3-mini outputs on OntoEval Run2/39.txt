**No**

The ontology does not provide an explicit way to determine which actors "hold this information" because it doesnâ€™t define a clear property or reification pattern linking actors to a particular piece of information. A partial answer can be obtained by retrieving all individuals of class Actor (with optional labels, if available):

PREFIX : <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actorODP/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}
