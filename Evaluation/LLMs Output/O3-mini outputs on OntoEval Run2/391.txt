**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that, using the reified class for representing a person’s role—which in our ontology is the class Cl_PersonRole (a subclass of Cl_Person, Cl_Role, Cl_Production, and Cl_Date)—retrieves the roles a specified person has in a specified production at a given point in time. (Here we assume that the individual URIs for the person and production are known, and that the date is given as a literal.)

For example, the query below assumes that:
• the individual representing the person is <http://www.example.org/test#FabioBianchi>;
• the individual representing the production is <http://www.example.org/test#Production_MerchantOfVenice>;
• and the “point in time” is provided as “2009-09-15”^^xsd:date.

You can adjust these IRIs and the date filter as needed.

SELECT ?person ?personName ?roleName ?roleDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :hasRole ?roleAssignment ;
          :memberName ?personName .
  ?roleAssignment a :Cl_PersonRole, :Cl_Production ;
                  :roleName ?roleName ;
                  :roleDate ?roleDate .
  # Filter to only roles for the given person, production, and on the given day
  FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#FabioBianchi> &&
         ?roleAssignment = <http://www.example.org/test#Production_MerchantOfVenice> &&
         ?roleDate = "2009-09-15"^^xsd:date)
}

This query shows that the ontology does indeed model the competency question (allowing one to “extract” the roles that a given person has in a given production at a given time under the closed‐world assumption).
