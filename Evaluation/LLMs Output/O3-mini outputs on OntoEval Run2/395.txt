**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query extracting the roles a given person has in a specified production at a certain time. (In the query, we assume that the person, production and time are provided as parameter filters.) 

For instance, assuming that:
 • The person is identified by a label (e.g. "Fabio Bianchi")
 • The production is identified by a label (e.g. "The Merchant of Venice")
 • And you want to check for role assignments on a given date

You could use the following query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?personName ?roleName ?roleDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          rdfs:label ?personName ;
          :hasRoleInProduction ?role .
  ?role a :Cl_RoleAssignment ;
         :roleName ?roleName ;
         :roleDate ?roleDate ;
         a :Cl_Production .  # role assignment instance also plays the role of a production

  # Filter for a specific person, production and point in time:
  FILTER(?personName = "Fabio Bianchi")
  ?role rdfs:label ?productionName .
  FILTER(?productionName = "The Merchant of Venice")
  FILTER(?roleDate = "2009-09-07"^^xsd:date)
}
ORDER BY ?roleDate

In this query, by using the reification class Cl_RoleAssignment (which is modelled as a subclass of Cl_Person, Cl_Production, and Cl_Date) and the property :hasRoleInProduction, the competency question is fully supported under the closed world assumption.
