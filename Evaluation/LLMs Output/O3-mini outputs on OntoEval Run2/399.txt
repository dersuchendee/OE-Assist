**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that—in a closed‐world assumption—retrieves each production along with its (unique) premier by ensuring that no production is linked to a different premier:

PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>

SELECT ?production ?premiere
WHERE {
  ?production a ns1:Production .
  ?production ns1:hasPremiere ?premiere .
  # Ensure that there is no second, different premier for the same production
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?production ns1:hasPremiere ?otherPremiere .
    FILTER(?otherPremiere != ?premiere)
  }
}

This query shows that for all productions the ontology provides exactly one premier, thereby modeling the competency question.
