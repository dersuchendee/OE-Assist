**Yes**

One way to answer “A production has exactly one premier” is to write a query that, under the closed world assumption, returns each production and counts its associated premier. If the count is exactly 1 then the CQ is satisfied. For example:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production (COUNT(?premier) AS ?premierCount)
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  OPTIONAL { ?production :hasPremier ?premier . }
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)
--------------------------------------------------

This query returns only those productions where exactly one premier is recorded.
