**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that returns each production that (under a closed‐world assumption) has exactly one associated premier event:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?production
WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?production (COUNT(?premier) AS ?premierCount)
    WHERE {
      ?premier rdf:type :Cl_ProductionPremier ;
               :premierOf ?production .
    }
    GROUP BY ?production
  }
  FILTER(?premierCount = 1)
}

In this query, we count for each production the number of premiere events (instances of :Cl_ProductionPremier) linked via the :premierOf property. Under the closed‐world assumption, only productions with exactly one premier are returned, which models the competency question “A production has exactly one premier.”
