**Yes**

We can verify the CQ “A production has exactly one premier” using the ontology’s restriction on :Cl_Production that enforces a single value for the property :hasPremiere. For example, the following SPARQL query returns each production along with its premiere date:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premiereDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremiere ?premiere .
  ?premiere :premiereDate ?premiereDate .
}
------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, every production in the dataset must have exactly one associated premiere.
