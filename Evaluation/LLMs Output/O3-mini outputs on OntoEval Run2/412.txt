**Yes**

Because the ontology defines a restriction on productions to have exactly one premier (via the qualified cardinality restriction on the property :hasPremier with value 1), we can write a SPARQL query to retrieve productions and their premier. For instance:

-----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premier
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
}
-----------------------------------

This query retrieves each production along with its premier, which (under the closed-world assumption and the ontologyâ€™s cardinality restriction) guarantees that every production appears with exactly one premier.
