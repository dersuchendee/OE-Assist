**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves each production together with its unique premier (by counting so that only productions having exactly one premier are returned):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?production (COUNT(?premier) AS ?premierCount) (MIN(?pd) AS ?premierDate)
    WHERE {
      ?production a :Cl_Production .
      ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
      ?premier :premierDate ?pd .
    }
    GROUP BY ?production
    HAVING (?premierCount = 1)
  }
}
