**Yes**

Assuming the closed‚Äêworld interpretation of the ontology, a production (an instance of :Cl_Production) is linked via the object property :hasPremier to a premier (an instance of :Cl_ProductionPremier) that provides the premier date (using the data property :premierDate). Under the assumption that every production is intended to have exactly one premier, we can write a SPARQL query that returns each production and its premier date only if there is exactly one associated premier. For example:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
GROUP BY ?production ?premierDate
HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)
------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the premier date for each production that has exactly one premier, thereby modeling the competency question.
