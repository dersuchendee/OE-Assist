Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves productions and their premier date—ensuring that for each production there is exactly one associated premier.

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premierDate .
}
GROUP BY ?production ?premierDate
HAVING (COUNT(?premierDate) = 1)
-------------------------------------------------

This query lists all productions (?production) along with their premier date (?premierDate) and uses a GROUP BY with a HAVING clause to ensure that exactly one premier is linked to each production, thereby confirming that the CQ is fully answerable by the ontology.
