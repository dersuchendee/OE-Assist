**Yes**

Assuming a closed‐world interpretation, we can check that every production (instance of :Cl_Production) has exactly one premier date by verifying that it has one and only one value for the property :premierDate. For example, the following SPARQL query extracts each production together with its premier date only if there is exactly one such date:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?production (SAMPLE(?premierDate) AS ?premierDate)
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
GROUP BY ?production
HAVING (COUNT(?premierDate) = 1)
ORDER BY ?production
--------------------------------------------------

In this query we:
1. Retrieve all individuals of type :Cl_Production that have a :premierDate.
2. Group by the production to count how many premier dates are attached.
3. Return only those productions for which the count equals 1.

This fulfills the competency question “A production has exactly one premier.”
