**No**  
Because the ontology does not fully reify the relationship between persons and the instruments they play, we cannot retrieve answers via a reified relationship. However, under the closed‐world assumption a partial answer can be extracted by directly querying the non‐reified property.

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}
```
