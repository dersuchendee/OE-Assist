**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, returns for a given musician (or for all musicians) the instruments they play:

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?musician ?musicianLabel ?instrument ?instrumentLabel
WHERE {
  # Retrieve musicians that have an associated "plays" property
  ?musician a :Musician ;
            :plays ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?musician rdfs:label ?musicianLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }
}
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

This query answers the competency question “What instruments does a certain person play?” by extracting, for each musician, the instruments registered via the :plays property.
