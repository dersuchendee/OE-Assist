**Yes**
Below is one example SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given person, the instruments they play via the reified relation in the ontology:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?instrument ?instrumentLabel
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?ip .
  ?ip :instrumentPlayed ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }
  # Replace <personURI> with the URI of the person of interest
  FILTER (?person = <personURI>)
}
------------------------------------------------

This query makes use of the reified relation (via :playsInstrument and :instrumentPlayed) to answer the competency question "What instruments does a certain person play?" under the closed world assumption.
