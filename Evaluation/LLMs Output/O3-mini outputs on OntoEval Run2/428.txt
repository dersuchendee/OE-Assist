**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given person, the instruments they play by following the reification introduced in the ontology:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?instrument ?instrumentLabel
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instPlaying .
  ?instPlaying :playedBy ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }
  
  # To restrict the query to a particular person, uncomment the line below and substitute the URI:
  # FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#YourPersonURI>)
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query uses the ontologyâ€™s reified relationship where a Cl_InstrumentPlaying instance connects a person (via :playsInstrument) to an instrument (via :playedBy). Under the closed world assumption, no additional missing relation is expected; therefore, the competency question "What instruments does a certain person play?" is fully answerable.
