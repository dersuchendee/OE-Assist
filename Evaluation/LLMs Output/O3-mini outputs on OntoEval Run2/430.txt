**Yes**

The ontology connects persons to the instruments they play via the property :playsInstrument. This allows us to directly extract which instruments a given person plays. For instance, you could run a query such as the following (replace the IRI in the FILTER clause with the person of interest):

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?instrument ?instrumentLabel
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }
  FILTER (?person = :Anthony_Kiedis)  # Replace with the target person IRI
}
--------------------------------

This SPARQL query returns the instruments that the specified person plays, which fully supports the competency question "What instruments does a certain person play?" under the closed world assumption.
