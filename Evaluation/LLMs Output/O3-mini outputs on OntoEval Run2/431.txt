**Yes**

Below is a sample SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption enforced by the ontology’s assertions, retrieves the instruments played by a specified person (here represented as ?person, which you can bind to a particular individual):

-----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  # Optionally, to restrict to a specific person (e.g., Anthony_Kiedis), uncomment the next line:
  # FILTER(?person = :Anthony_Kiedis)
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

This query directly exploits the object property “playsInstrument” defined in the ontology to answer the competency question "What instruments does a certain person play?"
