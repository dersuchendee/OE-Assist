**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves each performance’s date along with the geographic information (city, its region, and country) by following the relationships defined in the ontology:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?city ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate ;
               :performanceLocation ?city .
               
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City ;
        :locatedInRegion ?region .
        
  ?region :locatedInCountry ?country .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate

─────────────────────────────

This query assumes the competency question is “What is the geographic location (city, region, country) of each performance?” and, under the closed world assumption, all location relationships are explicitly given in the ontology.
