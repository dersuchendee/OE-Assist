**Yes**

The ontology models competency‚Äêrelated aspects through the class actorODP:Capability and the property actorODP:capabilityOf (which links a capability to the actor holding it). Under a closed world assumption, we assume that any actor not explicitly linked via actorODP:capabilityOf does not hold the competency. Thus this CQ is answerable via the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX actorODP: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actorODP/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?actor ?actorLabel ?capability
WHERE {
  ?capability a actorODP:Capability .
  ?capability actorODP:capabilityOf ?actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel. }
}
