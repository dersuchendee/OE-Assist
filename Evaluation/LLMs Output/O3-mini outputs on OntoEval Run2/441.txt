**Yes**

Assuming we have an individual representing “a certain person” (for example, :JohnDoe) of type :Cl_Person, we can directly retrieve the instruments that person plays via the :playsInstrument property. For instance, under the closed world assumption the following SPARQL query extracts the instruments (and their labels, if available):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?instrument ?instrumentLabel
WHERE {
  :JohnDoe a :Cl_Person ;
           :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }
}

This query answers the competency question “What instruments does a certain person play?” using the ontology’s modelling.
