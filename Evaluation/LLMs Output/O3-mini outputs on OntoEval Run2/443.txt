Below is a SPARQL query that, given a band and a specific time, returns its members whose memberships cover that time. (Here we assume that the time:Interval individual used in the ontology has properties time:hasBeginning and time:hasEnd to denote the start and end of the interval.)

SELECT ?member ?memberName ?membershipInterval ?begin ?end
WHERE {
  # Specify the band of interest (e.g., “Red Hot Chili Peppers”)
  ?band rdf:type :Band ;
        rdfs:label "Red Hot Chili Peppers" .

  # Retrieve memberships linking the band and its musicians
  ?membership :membershipInBand ?band ;
              :membershipTime ?membershipInterval .

  # Assume a musician has that membership
  ?member :memberOf ?membership ;
          :hasName ?memberName .

  # Get the start and end of the membership interval
  ?membershipInterval time:hasBeginning ?begin ;
                      time:hasEnd ?end .

  # A given time (as an xsd:dateTime literal) is provided; for example:
  BIND(xsd:dateTime("2004-10-01T00:00:00Z") AS ?time)
  
  # Check if the given time is within the membership interval
  FILTER(?time >= ?begin && ?time <= ?end)
}

This query directly answers the CQ by extracting the band members who were active at the specified point in time.
