**Yes**

For example, if you want to retrieve the members of a given band (say, "RedHotChiliPeppers") that were active at a specific point in time (passed as a date), you could use a query like this. In this query we assume that each membership has a start date (and optionally an end date) via the properties :membershipStart and :membershipEnd. We then filter to select only those memberships where the given time falls within the membership period.

(Note: Adjust the band URI and the given time as needed.)

ORDER BY ?member

This query demonstrates that the ontology has been modeled using a reification approach (the :Cl_BandMembership class along with properties such as :membershipStart, :membershipEnd, and :hasMembership) and therefore fully supports answering the CQ "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" under the closed world assumption.
