Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the artists (members) of a specific band who were active (i.e. their membership dates encompass) at a given time. In this query, the ontology’s reified membership (Cl_Membership) is used along with its properties (membership_artist, membership_band, membership_startDate, membership_endDate). Under the closed world assumption, if an end date is missing then the membership is assumed to be ongoing.

For demonstration, a specific band IRI (e.g. <http://www.example.org/test#RedHotChiliPeppers>) is used and a time point is bound (here as "2005-01-01") so that only memberships active on that date are shown.
