Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a band (for example, RedHotChiliPeppers) and a date of interest, retrieves its members whose membership time interval covers that date:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?band ?member ?memberName ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :BandMembership ;
              :hasBand ?band ;
              :involvesMember ?member ;
              :hasTimeInterval ?interval .
  ?member :personName ?memberName .
  ?interval :startDate ?startDate ;
            :endDate ?endDate .
  # Replace "2006-01-01" with the point in time of interest:
  FILTER(xsd:date("2006-01-01") >= ?startDate && xsd:date("2006-01-01") <= ?endDate)
  # Optionally restrict to a particular band:
  FILTER(?band = <http://example.org/music#RedHotChiliPeppers>)
}
ORDER BY ?memberName
-------------------------------------------------

This query leverages the reified membership (BandMembership) class that connects a person (member), a band, and a time interval. In a closed‚Äêworld setting, only those memberships whose defined start and end dates encompass the given point are returned.
