**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a band of interest and a time point, retrieves its members (using the reified membership with start and end dates):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?band ?bandLabel ?member ?memberLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  # Band of interest (you can replace the IRI with the specific band)
  VALUES ?band { <http://www.example.org/test#SomeBand> }
  ?band rdfs:label ?bandLabel .
  
  # Retrieve the membership information for the band
  ?band :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership :member ?member .
  ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel .
  
  # Get the membership period
  ?membership :startDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :endDate ?endDate }
  
  # Define the point in time (change the date as needed)
  BIND("2006-01-01"^^xsd:date AS ?pointInTime)
  
  # Filter memberships active at the given point in time:
  FILTER(?pointInTime >= ?startDate && (!bound(?endDate) || ?pointInTime <= ?endDate))
}
ORDER BY ?memberLabel
------------------------------------------------

This query uses the reified membership (Cl_Membership) to check that the queried time point is within the membership period and thus answers the competency question.
