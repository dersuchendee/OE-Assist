**Yes**

Assuming that the membership information is reified via a band‐membership class (here :Cl_BandMembership) that links a band, a person, and a time period (with properties such as :membershipPeriod referring to a reified time period that has start/end data), you can answer the CQ “What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?” with a query such as the following. (Here the band is given by its URI and the time point is provided as the parameter ?givenTime – note that the query assumes that the time period instances have properties (for example, :hasStart and :hasEnd) that mark the validity period of the membership.)

SELECT ?member ?memberLabel ?band ?bandLabel ?membership ?timePeriod ?start ?end
WHERE {
  ?band a :Cl_Band ;
        rdfs:label ?bandLabel ;
        :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership ;
              :memberOf ?member ;
              :membershipPeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel .
  ?timePeriod :hasStart ?start ;
              :hasEnd ?end .

  # Replace the band URI and givenTime below with the desired values:
  FILTER(?band = <http://www.example.org/test#RedHotChiliPeppers>)
  FILTER(xsd:dateTime(?start) <= xsd:dateTime("2004-09-01T00:00:00") &&
         xsd:dateTime("2004-09-01T00:00:00") <= xsd:dateTime(?end))
}
ORDER BY ?memberLabel
----------------------------------------------------------

Under the closed‐world assumption this query returns the members of the given band that were recorded as being in its membership at the specified point in time.
