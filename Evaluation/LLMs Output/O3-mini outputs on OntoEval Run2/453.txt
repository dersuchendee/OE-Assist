**Yes**

Below is one way to write a SPARQL query that—under the closed‐world assumption and using the reified band membership (Cl_BandMembership)—retrieves the persons that were members of a given band at a specific time. (In this query the band and the time point are provided as filter criteria.)

  ?band a :Cl_Band ;
        rdfs:label "Red Hot Chili Peppers" ;
        :hasMember ?membership .
        
  # The membership instance connects the band to a person and a time period.
  ?membership :duringTimePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?person :memberOfBand ?membership .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?band rdfs:label ?bandLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  
  # Filter for a given point in time.
  # Here we assume that ?timePeriod denotes a time instance or otherwise is comparable to a given point.
  # Replace "2005-01-01T00:00:00Z" with the desired point in time.
  FILTER (?timePeriod = "2005-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
ORDER BY ?person

Explanation:

• The ontology models band membership via the reified class Cl_BandMembership. A band (an instance of Cl_Band) is linked via the property :hasMember to a membership instance.
• Each membership instance is associated with a time period through :duringTimePeriod and linked to a person via :memberOfBand.
• The query filters the memberships so that only those valid at the given time point are returned.
• Under the closed‐world assumption, we assume that if there is no assertion relating a membership’s time period to the given point the membership does not hold at that time.

This makes the competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" answerable by the ontology.
