Below is a SPARQL query that uses the reified membership information (the class :Cl_Membership with its time‐constraints via :membershipStart and optionally :membershipEnd) to retrieve the members of a chosen band (here :Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers) that were active at a given point in time (which you can supply as a parameter). Under a closed world assumption, we assume that if a band member’s membership record exists, then that record completely determines when the person was a member.

For example, if you want to know the members on a specific date (here “2004-01-01”), you can use:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?member ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  # Get the membership records for the specified band
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership ;
              :memberOf :Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers ;
              :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd . }
  
  # Filter memberships active at the given date:
  FILTER (
    ?membershipStart <= "2004-01-01"^^xsd:date &&
    ( !BOUND(?membershipEnd) || ?membershipEnd >= "2004-01-01"^^xsd:date )
  )
  
  # And retrieve the corresponding band member, by joining via the fact that
  # the band always lists its members through the property :hasMember.
  :Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers :hasMember ?member .
  
  # (Under the closed world assumption, only those persons with a valid membership
  # record are considered current members at the specified time)
}
ORDER BY ?member
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?” by extracting those persons whose reified membership for the given band is active at the specified date.
