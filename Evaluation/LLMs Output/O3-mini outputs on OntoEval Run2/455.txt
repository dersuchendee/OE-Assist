**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that, given a band and a specific time, returns all persons who are recorded as a member of that band at that moment:

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?member ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership ;
              :membershipInBand ?band ;
              :hasMember ?member ;
              :atTime ?membershipTime .
  FILTER(?band = :Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers &&
         ?membershipTime = "1988-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
ORDER BY ?member
--------------------------------

In this query the band is specified (e.g., :Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers) and the query filters for memberships recorded at the given point in time. This shows that the ontology models the competency question.
