  # Find the performance of the song “Hump_de_Bump” 
  ?perfSong a :Cl_PerformanceSong ;
            :performedSong :Hump_de_Bump ;
            :performedAt ?performance .
  
  # Get the performance date  
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate ;
               :performanceLocation ?city .
  
  # Get location details: the city is located in a region which in turn is in a country
  ?city :locatedInRegion ?region .
  ?region :locatedInCountry ?country .
}

In this query the ontology is assumed to provide enough links (via classes Cl_PerformanceSong, Cl_Performance, Cl_Location, Cl_City, Cl_Region, and Cl_Country) to answer the competency question embedded in the story.
