**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology reifies band membership using the class Cl_Membership—with properties linking a person to a band (membershipBand and membershipPerson) as well as start and end dates (membershipStartDate and membershipEndDate)—we can answer the CQ “What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?” by selecting for memberships whose period covers the given point in time. Under the closed world assumption, we assume that if a membership end date is not present then the membership is still valid.

Below is an example SPARQL query. You can bind the band of interest (here as ?band) and the time (as ?atTime) to get the answer:

---------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?member ?memberLabel ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership ;
              :membershipBand ?band ;
              :membershipPerson ?member ;
              :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
  
  # Filter: the membership must have started on or before the given time
  FILTER ( xsd:dateTime(?membershipStartDate) <= xsd:dateTime(?atTime) )
  
  # And either it has no end date or it ended after (or exactly at) the given time
  FILTER ( !bound(?membershipEndDate) || xsd:dateTime(?membershipEndDate) >= xsd:dateTime(?atTime) )
  
  # Example: filter for the particular band by its IRI; replace with the band you need.
  FILTER ( ?band = <http://www.example.org/test#RedHotChiliPeppers> )
}
ORDER BY ?membershipStartDate
---------------------------------------------------------

In this query, you supply the ?atTime parameter (for example, "2006-05-05T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime) to obtain the members of the specified band active at that point in time.
