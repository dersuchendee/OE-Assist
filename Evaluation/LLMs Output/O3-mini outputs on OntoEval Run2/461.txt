**Yes**

Assuming that the “certain band” is represented by an instance (or variable) of :Cl_Band and that membership over time is modelled using the reified class :Cl_Membership with properties :membershipStart, :membershipEnd, and :membershipIn (linking the membership to the band) as well as linking persons to their memberships via :hasMembership, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the band members at a given point in time. Under the closed world assumption, only those memberships with explicit start and end dates are considered.

For example, given a band (specified via ?band) and a time parameter ?time (an xsd:date), the query would be:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personLabel ?membership ?start ?end
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership .
  ?membership :membershipIn ?band .
  ?membership :membershipStart ?start .
  ?membership :membershipEnd ?end .
  FILTER(?start <= ?time && ?time <= ?end) .

  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel. }
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query:
• ?band is the band of interest.
• ?time is the specific date (of type xsd:date) at which we want to know the band members.
• We select those memberships whose start is on or before ?time and whose end is on or after ?time.
• Then we retrieve the corresponding persons (band members).

Thus, the ontology supports the competency question "What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?" under the closed world assumption.
