**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the members of a given band valid at a specified point in time. In this query, replace VALUE_FOR_BAND and VALUE_FOR_TIME with the specific band identifier (e.g. an IRI from your data) and the desired moment (in xsd:dateTime format).

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
FROM <your-data-graph>
WHERE {
  ?band a :Cl_Band .
  FILTER(?band = VALUE_FOR_BAND) .

  ?band :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership .
  ?membership :isMember ?person .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
  ?membership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate .

  # The given time must fall within the membership period.
  FILTER(xsd:dateTime(?membershipStartDate) <= VALUE_FOR_TIME &&
         xsd:dateTime(?membershipEndDate) >= VALUE_FOR_TIME)
}
ORDER BY ?membershipStartDate

This query shows that the ontology models the competency question by capturing band memberships with valid start and end dates, allowing us to answer “What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?”
