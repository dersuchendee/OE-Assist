**Yes**
Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption and using the reified membership class, retrieves for a given band its members active at a given time. In this example the band (e.g. “Red Hot Chili Peppers”) and the point in time (here represented by a time value on the time period instance, for example "2006-08-11T00:00:00") are given as filter parameters. (In your actual data the time–related property might have a different name; adjust accordingly.)

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personLabel
WHERE {
  ?band a :Cl_Band ;
        rdfs:label ?bandName .
  FILTER(?bandName = "Red Hot Chili Peppers") .

  ?band :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership ;
              :memberOfDuring ?timePeriod .
              
  # Assume each time period has a time value via property :hasTimeValue
  ?timePeriod :hasTimeValue ?timeValue .
  FILTER(?timeValue = "2006-08-11T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime) .
  
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :isMemberOfBand ?membership .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?personLabel

In this query the reification of band membership (class :Cl_BandMembership) captures the triple association among a person, a band, and a time period. Hence the competency question “What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?” is answerable by the ontology.
