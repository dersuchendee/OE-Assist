**Yes**

Assuming the ontology “reifies” band membership (via the class Cl_BandMembership) with properties that connect a person to a band (using :memberOf and :hasMembership), record their role (via :hasRole) and indicate the period of the membership (using :membershipStart and, optionally, :membershipEnd), you can extract the role a given person has in a given band at a given time. For example, to query for the role of a specific person in a specific band at a given point in time, you could use a query like this:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :hasMembership ?band ;
              :hasRole ?role ;
              :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd . }
  
  # Bind the input parameters (adjust these IRIs and date as needed)
  FILTER (?person = :AnthonyKiedis && ?band = :RedHotChiliPeppers)
  
  # Check that the membership period covers the target time.
  # For example, if we want to know the role on "2005-01-01":
  FILTER ( xsd:date("2005-01-01") >= ?membershipStart &&
          ( !BOUND(?membershipEnd) || xsd:date("2005-01-01") <= ?membershipEnd ) )
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the role (and the membership start/end dates) for a given person (here :AnthonyKiedis) in a given band (here :RedHotChiliPeppers) at a specified date (here "2005-01-01"). Thus, under the closed world assumption the CQ is fully answerable by the ontology.
