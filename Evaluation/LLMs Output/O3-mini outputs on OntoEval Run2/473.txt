Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, returns the role that a given person has in a given band at a specified point in time. In this example the ontology uses reification (via a member role with an associated time period) so that each person’s role (recorded through the property :hasRole) is linked to a time period (via :atTime whose properties :startDate and :endDate indicate validity). You can adjust the URIs for the person and band, and the time value used in the FILTER as needed.

  ?person :hasRole ?role.
  ?role a :Cl_MemberRole.
  OPTIONAL { ?role :roleName ?roleName. }
  
  # The role is valid during a certain time period.
  ?role :atTime ?timePeriod.
  ?timePeriod :startDate ?startDate.
  ?timePeriod :endDate ?endDate.
  
  # Apply closed-world constraints:
  # Only return the role valid at the given point in time.
  # (Replace the following URIs with those of the specific person and band and the date with the time of interest.)
  FILTER( ?person = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificPersonURI> )
  FILTER( ?band = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificBandURI> )
  FILTER( "2020-06-01"^^xsd:date >= ?startDate && "2020-06-01"^^xsd:date <= ?endDate )
}
ORDER BY ?startDate
--------------------------------------------------

This query finds, for a specified person and band, the role (its name and the validity period) that is active at the given date (“2020‑06‑01” in this example).
