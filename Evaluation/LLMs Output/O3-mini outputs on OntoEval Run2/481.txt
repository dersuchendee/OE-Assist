**Yes**

Below is a sample SPARQL query that retrieves each album and the tracks it contains:

-----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?album ?track 
WHERE {
  ?album rdf:type :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
ORDER BY ?album ?track
-----------------------------------------

In the ontology the class :Cl_Album is defined with a restriction requiring at least one :containsTrack property. Therefore this competency question (to list which albums have tracks) is fully modelled by the ontology.
