**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that retrieves the role of a given person in a given band at a specified time using the reified relationship class (:Cl_PersonRoleBandTime):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?band ?time ?role
WHERE {
  ?assignment a :Cl_PersonRoleBandTime ;
              :hasPerson ?person ;
              :hasBand ?band ;
              :hasTime ?time ;
              :hasRole ?role .

  # For a specific query, you might add filters like:
  FILTER(?person = :AnthonyKiedis &&
         ?band = :RedHotChiliPeppers &&
         ?time = "1983-01-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
ORDER BY ?person ?band ?time
------------------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports answering the competency question by reifying the relationship between a person, their role, the band they belong to, and the time period in which that role is held.
