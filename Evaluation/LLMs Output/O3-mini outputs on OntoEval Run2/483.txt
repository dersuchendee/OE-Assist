**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a specific person, a specific band, and a point in time, retrieves the role that the person had in the band at that time. (Replace the VALUES below with the actual URI for the person and band and the desired date.)

SELECT ?role ?roleName ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  # Specify the person, band, and the point in time (as xsd:date)
  VALUES ?person { <http://www.example.org/test#SomePerson> }
  VALUES ?band   { <http://www.example.org/test#SomeBand> }
  BIND("2020-01-01"^^xsd:date AS ?pointInTime)
  
  # Find memberships linking the person and the band
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership ;
              :membershipPerson ?person ;
              :membershipBand ?band ;
              :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate ;
              :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate ;
              :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
  
  # Filter memberships that are active at the provided point in time
  FILTER(?pointInTime >= ?membershipStartDate && ?pointInTime <= ?membershipEndDate)
}
ORDER BY ?membershipStartDate

# Explanation:
# The query looks for a membership (reified through :Cl_Membership) associating a given person with a given band.
# It then retrieves the associated role (via :hasRole and :roleName), where the provided
# point in time falls between the membership's start and end dates.
