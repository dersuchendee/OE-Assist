Below is a SPARQL query that, given a particular person, a particular band, and a specific time instant, returns the role of that person in that band at that time (based on the reified Cl_Membership information):

SELECT ?role ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  # The given individual person and band (replace the URIs with the actual ones)
  VALUES ?person { <http://www.example.org/test#SomePerson> }
  VALUES ?band { <http://www.example.org/test#SomeBand> }
  # The time point for which we want to check the membership (replace with actual date)
  BIND("2004-09-01"^^xsd:date AS ?time)
  
  # Retrieve the membership record connecting the person to the band
  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipIn ?band .
  ?membership :hasRole ?role .
  ?membership :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd .
  
  # Ensure that the given time falls within the membership start and end dates
  FILTER(?time >= ?membershipStart && ?time <= ?membershipEnd)
}
ORDER BY ?membershipStart

This query demonstrates that the ontology fully supports answering the competency question under the closed world assumption.
