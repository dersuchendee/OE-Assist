**Yes**

Assuming that the individual person and band are known (e.g. via their URIs), we can retrieve the role assignment valid at a given time by checking the role assignment’s start and end dates. For example, the following SPARQL query (using the closed world assumption) retrieves the role of a specific person in a specific band at a given point in time:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?roleStartDate ?roleEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :hasRoleAssignment ?assignment .
  ?assignment :roleInBand ?band ;
              :hasRole ?role ;
              :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate ;
              :roleEndDate ?roleEndDate .

  # Replace the following URIs with the specific person and band identifiers
  FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificPerson> && 
         ?band = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificBand> &&
         xsd:dateTime("2004-09-01T00:00:00Z") >= ?roleStartDate &&
         xsd:dateTime("2004-09-01T00:00:00Z") <= ?roleEndDate)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology models the relationship between a person, their band role assignments (with temporal validity given by roleStartDate and roleEndDate), and the band—a direct answer to the competency question "What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?"
