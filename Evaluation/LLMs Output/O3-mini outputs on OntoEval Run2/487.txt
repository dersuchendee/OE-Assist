**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the role (its role name) for a given person, band, and point in time. In this query we assume that the person is linked to a membership (using :hasMembership) that specifies the band (using :membershipInBand), the valid time period (via :membershipStart and :membershipEnd), and the membership’s role (via :hasRole and the role’s :roleName):

SELECT ?roleName
WHERE {
  # Bind the given person, band, and the point in time
  BIND(<http://www.example.org/test#SomePerson> AS ?person) .
  BIND(<http://www.example.org/test#SomeBand> AS ?band) .
  BIND("2006-05-05"^^xsd:date AS ?pointTime) .

  # Find the membership of the person
  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .

  # Ensure the membership is in the specified band
  ?membership :membershipInBand ?band .

  # Get the membership's valid start and end (using a closed world assumption)
  ?membership :membershipStart ?start .
  ?membership :membershipEnd ?end .

  # Check that the given point in time lies within the membership period
  FILTER(?pointTime >= ?start && ?pointTime <= ?end) .

  # Retrieve the role associated with this membership
  ?membership :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
}

In this query you would replace the IRIs for the person (<http://www.example.org/test#SomePerson>), band (<http://www.example.org/test#SomeBand>), and the literal date "2006-05-05" with the actual values you are interested in querying.
