**No**

The ontology does not fully support this CQ because the recording period is modelled only for instances of Cl_AlbumRecording and there is no explicit link between a general album (instance of Cl_Album) and its recording period information. Under the closed world assumption, we can only extract recording dates from those albums that are directly typed as Cl_AlbumRecording.

A partial answer can be obtained by the following SPARQL query, which retrieves albums (that are also Cl_AlbumRecording) along with their recording start and end dates:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album (SAMPLE(?albumLabel) AS ?label) ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_AlbumRecording ;
         :dp_recordingStartDate ?recordingStart ;
         :dp_recordingEndDate ?recordingEnd .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel. }
}
GROUP BY ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd

This query only returns an answer for albums defined as Cl_AlbumRecording, not for all Cl_Album individuals, which is why the CQ is only partially answerable by the given ontology.
