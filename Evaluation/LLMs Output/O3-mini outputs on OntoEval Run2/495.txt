**Yes**
Below is a sample SPARQL query that retrieves the time interval during which a given album (for example, “Stadium Arcadium”) was recorded:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumTitle ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?recording a :Recording ;
             :recordedAlbum ?album ;
             :recordedDuring ?interval .
  ?album :albumTitle ?albumTitle .
  ?interval :startDate ?startDate ;
            :endDate ?endDate .
  FILTER(?album = :StadiumArcadium)
}
------------------------------------------------

This query confirms that the CQ “During what time period was a certain album recorded?” is answerable using the ontology under the closed world assumption.
