**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the recording period for each album by linking an album (of type Cl_MusicAlbum) to its recording event (an instance of Cl_Recording or its subclass) via the property :hasRecording and then extracting the value from the property :recordingPeriod:

SELECT ?album ?recordingPeriod
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
  ?album :hasRecording ?recording .
  ?recording :recordingPeriod ?recordingPeriod .
}

This query answers the CQ: “During what time period was a certain album recorded?” by directly extracting the recording period information for each album.
