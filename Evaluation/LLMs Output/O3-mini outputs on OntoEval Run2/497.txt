**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each album, the time period (via its recorded album instance) during which it was recorded:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  
  ?album :recordedAlbum ?albumRecording .
  ?albumRecording :recordingPeriod ?timePeriod .
}

ORDER BY ?album

This query uses the ontology’s properties—specifically, the recordedAlbum property (whose range is Cl_AlbumRecording) and the recordingPeriod property (which links the album recording to a Cl_TimePeriod)—to answer the competency question under the closed world assumption.
