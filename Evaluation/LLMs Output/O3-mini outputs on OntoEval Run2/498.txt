**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each album, its time period of recording by following the relationships defined in the ontology:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingPeriod
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :recordedDuring ?albumRecording .
  ?albumRecording :recordingPeriod ?recordingPeriod .
}
ORDER BY ?album
------------------------------------------------------------

In this query the CQ “During what time period was a certain album recorded?” is answerable using the ontology constructs:
– Albums are instances of :Cl_Album.
– The recording event is linked to the album via :recordedDuring.
– The time period of the recording is retrieved through :recordingPeriod.

Under a closed world assumption, we assume that if such triples do not exist for a particular album then no recording time is available.
