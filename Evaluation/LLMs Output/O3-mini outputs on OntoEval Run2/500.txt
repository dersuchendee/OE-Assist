**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given album (here, Stadium Arcadium), its recording start and end dates:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  # Find the recording that is linked to the album via the :recorded property  
  ?recording :recorded ?album ;
             :recordingStart ?recordingStart ;
             :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
  FILTER(?album = :Stadium_Arcadium)
}
--------------------------------------------------

Under the closed-world assumption (i.e. assuming any missing data are false), this query returns the recording period of the album, thus fully modeling the competency question.
