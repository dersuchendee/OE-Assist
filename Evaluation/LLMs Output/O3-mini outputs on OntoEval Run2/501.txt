Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given album, the start and end date of its recording period by following the :recordedDuring relation to an album recording instance that provides the :recordingStart and :recordingEnd properties.

SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :recordedDuring ?recording .
  ?recording :recordingStart ?recordingStart ;
             :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
  
  # You can restrict to a certain album by uncommenting the next line
  #FILTER(?album = :Stadium_Arcadium)
}

This query shows that the ontology models the competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?" by connecting an album (instance of Cl_Album) with its recording details.
