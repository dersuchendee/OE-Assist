**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that returns the recording start and end times for a specific album (here, the album “Stadium Arcadium”):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?recording a :Cl_RecordingPeriod ;
             :recordedAlbum ?album ;
             :recordingStart ?recordingStart ;
             :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
  FILTER(?album = :Stadium_Arcadium)
}
--------------------------------------------------

Under the closed-world assumption, since the ontology asserts a recording period individual (often named :Stadium_Arcadium_Recording) that links to the album via the :recordedAlbum property as well as provides the :recordingStart and :recordingEnd values, the competency question “During what time period was a certain album recorded?” is fully supported by the ontology.
