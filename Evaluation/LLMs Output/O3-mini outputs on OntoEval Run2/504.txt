**No**

The intended CQ is “During what time period was a certain album recorded?” Although the ontology defines a class for a recording period (with properties such as recordingStart and recordingEnd) the current data does not include an individual that relates the album to its recording period. For a partial answer we can at least extract the album’s release date.

A SPARQL query for a partial answer would be:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  FILTER(?album = :StadiumArcadium)
}
------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the release date of the album “StadiumArcadium,” a piece of information that is available even though the recording period (start and end dates) is not given.
