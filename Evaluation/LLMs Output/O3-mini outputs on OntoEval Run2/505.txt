**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the time period during which a given album (e.g., StadiumArcadium) was recorded:

--------------------------------------------------

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordedDuring
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :hasRecording ?recording .
  ?recording :recordedDuring ?recordedDuring .
  FILTER(?album = :StadiumArcadium)
}
ORDER BY ?recordedDuring

--------------------------------------------------

This query works under a closed‚Äêworld assumption by directly extracting the recording time from the reified album recording information available in the ontology.
