**Yes**

Assuming that an album’s recording session is reified as an instance of Cl_RecordingSession—with properties (here re‐using membershipStart and membershipEnd) specifying the recording start and end dates and that an album is connected to its recording session via the recordedDuring property—you can write a SPARQL query to retrieve the time period during which a given album was recorded. For example, if you want to extract the recording period of a particular album (say, using its label "Stadium Arcadium"), the following query uses a closed world assumption to return the album’s recording start and end dates:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel .
  ?album :recordedDuring ?session .
  ?session :membershipStart ?recordingStart .
  ?session :membershipEnd ?recordingEnd .
  FILTER(?albumLabel = "Stadium Arcadium")
}

This query answers the competency question by extracting the recording time boundaries (the time period) for the specified album.
