**Yes**

We can extract the recording period for an album because the ontology defines a class Cl_Album together with the data properties :recordingStart and :recordingEnd. Under a closed world assumption, we assume that if an album has been recorded its recordingStart and recordingEnd dates are asserted. Therefore, the competency question “During what time period was a certain album recorded?” is fully supported by the ontology.

A suitable SPARQL query is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :recordingStart ?recordingStart .
  ?album :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
}
