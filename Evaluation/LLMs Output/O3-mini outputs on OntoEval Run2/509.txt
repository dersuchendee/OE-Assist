**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given album, its recording session start and end dates (i.e. the time period during which it was recorded):

-----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingStartDate ?recordingEndDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :hasRecordingSession ?session .
  ?session :recordingStartDate ?recordingStartDate ;
           :recordingEndDate ?recordingEndDate .
}
ORDER BY ?album
-----------------------------------------------------------

This query is possible because the ontology defines the class :Cl_Album together with the property :hasRecordingSession that links an album to its recording session, and the session provides the properties :recordingStartDate and :recordingEndDate.
