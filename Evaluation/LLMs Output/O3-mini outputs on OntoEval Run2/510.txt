**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that uses the properties defined in the ontology (namely, :recordingStart and :recordingEnd on a Cl_Album) to extract the recording period for a given album (for example, “Stadium Arcadium”):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :recordingStart ?recordingStart ;
         :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd ;
         rdfs:label ?label .
  FILTER(?label = "Stadium Arcadium")
}

This query correctly returns the time period during which the specified album was recorded, thus demonstrating that the CQ is fully supported by the ontology under a closed world assumption.
