**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the number of tracks for a given album (in this case “Stadium Arcadium”):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumName ?trackCount
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
  ?album :hasName ?albumName .
  ?album :hasTrackCount ?trackInfo .
  ?trackInfo :hasTrackCount ?trackCount .
  FILTER(?albumName = "Stadium Arcadium")
}
--------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
• The ontology models the album’s track count using a reified class (:Cl_AlbumTrackInfo) linked to the album via the property :hasTrackCount.
• The query looks up an album (instance of :Cl_MusicAlbum) with a given name and retrieves the associated track count from the related reification node.
• Under the closed world assumption only the stated information is assumed, making the answer derivable from the given assertions.
