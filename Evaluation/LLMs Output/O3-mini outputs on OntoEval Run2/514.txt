**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves each album’s name together with the number of tracks it contains:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumName ?trackCount
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
  ?album :hasName ?albumName .

  # The ontology models the track count via a reified class,
  # where the album is linked to an album track info individual that holds the track count
  ?album :hasTrackCount ?trackInfo .
  ?trackInfo :hasTrackCount ?trackCount .
}
ORDER BY ?albumName
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “How many tracks does a particular album contain?” by selecting albums with their corresponding track count.
