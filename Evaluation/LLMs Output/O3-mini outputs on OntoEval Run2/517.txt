**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves each album (or a particular album if filtered) along with the count of its tracks:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel (COUNT(?track) AS ?trackCount)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album ?albumLabel
------------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question by counting the number of tracks associated with each album via the property “hasTrack.”
