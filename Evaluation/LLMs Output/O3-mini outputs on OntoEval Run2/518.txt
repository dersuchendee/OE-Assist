**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, counts the number of tracks associated with a given album (in this case, "Stadium Arcadium"):

PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?albumTitle (COUNT(?track) AS ?trackCount)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album ;
         :albumTitle ?albumTitle ;
         :hasTrack ?track .
  FILTER(?albumTitle = "Stadium Arcadium")
}
GROUP BY ?albumTitle

This query answers the CQ “How many tracks does a particular album contain?” by counting how many tracks are linked to the album.
