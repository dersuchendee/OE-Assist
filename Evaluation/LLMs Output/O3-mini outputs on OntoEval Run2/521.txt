**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, returns for a given album (e.g. “Stadium Arcadium”) the number of tracks it contains:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         rdfs:label "Stadium Arcadium" ;
         :containsTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album

This query extracts the album instance with the given label and counts all related instances via the :containsTrack property.
