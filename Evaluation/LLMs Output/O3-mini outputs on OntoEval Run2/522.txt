**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, counts the album tracks for a given album (here “Stadium Arcadium” is identified via its label):

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album rdfs:label "Stadium Arcadium" .
  ?album :containsTracks ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album
---------------------------------

This query retrieves the album identified as “Stadium Arcadium” and counts all ?track instances connected to it via the property :containsTracks, thus fully answering the CQ.
