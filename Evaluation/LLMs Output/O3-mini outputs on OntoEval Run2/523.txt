**Yes**

Assuming a closed‐world view and that albums include a direct data property recording the number of tracks, for example with an individual album like Stadium Arcadium, you can write a SPARQL query such as:

  PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
  PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
  PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

  SELECT ?album ?numberOfTracks
  WHERE {
   ?album a :Cl_Album .
   ?album :numberOfTracks ?numberOfTracks .
  }
  ORDER BY ?album

This query retrieves every album and its recorded number of tracks, thereby answering the CQ “How many tracks does a particular album contain?”
