**Yes**

Below is an example query that counts the tracks contained in a given album (here the album "Stadium_Arcadium"):

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :containsTrack ?track .
  FILTER(?album = :Stadium_Arcadium)
}
GROUP BY ?album
------------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology models the competency question by linking a Cl_Album to its tracks via the :containsTrack property and then counting them.
