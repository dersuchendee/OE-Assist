**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, counts the number of tracks contained in the album Stadium Arcadium:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  :StadiumArcadium :containsTrack ?track .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves all distinct tracks related to the album :StadiumArcadium via the “containsTrack” property and counts them, thus answering the competency question.
