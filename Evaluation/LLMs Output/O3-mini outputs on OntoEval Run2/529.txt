**Yes**

A SPARQL query that returns, for a given album, its label and the number of tracks it contains can be written as follows:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?trackCount
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel .
  ?album :containsTracks ?trackCount .
  # Optionally, restrict to a particular album by its label. For example:
  FILTER(?albumLabel = "Stadium Arcadium")
}

This query shows that the ontology provides a direct connection from an album (instance of :Cl_Album) to a track count via the property :containsTracks. Hence, the competency question is answerable by the ontology.
