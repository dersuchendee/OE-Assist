**Yes**

Assuming that the “particular album” is represented as an instance of the :Cl_Album class (and that the number of tracks is stored with the data property :numberOfTracks), the following SPARQL query retrieves, for each album, the number of tracks it contains. Under the closed world assumption, we assume that every album has a recorded value for :numberOfTracks.

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?numTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  ?album :numberOfTracks ?numTracks .
}

If you need the answer for a specific album (for example, Stadium Arcadium), you can parameterize the query further by filtering on that album's identifier or label.
