**Yes**

We can answer the CQ since the ontology includes MusicAlbum instances that have an associated release date via the :releaseDate datatype property. Assuming that the “certain album” is provided (or can be filtered), a SPARQL query extracting the album and its release date is shown below:

------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :MusicAlbum .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel. }
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  # To restrict to a specific album, e.g., Stadium Arcadium, uncomment:
  # FILTER(?album = :StadiumArcadium)
}
ORDER BY ?releaseDate
------------------------------

This query returns the album(s) along with their labels (if present) and their release dates, thereby answering the competency question.
