**Yes**

We can answer “When was a certain album released?” by querying for albums and their release dates. For example, using the ontology provided, a SPARQL query could be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?title ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum ;
         :hasTitle ?title ;
         :hasReleaseDate ?releaseDate .
  # Optionally, filter for a specific album e.g.:
  # FILTER(?title = "Stadium Arcadium")
}
ORDER BY ?title

This query retrieves each album’s title and its release date, which fully answers the competency question under a closed world assumption.
