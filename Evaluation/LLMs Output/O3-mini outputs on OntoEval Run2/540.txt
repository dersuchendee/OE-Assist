We can answer “When was a certain album released?” using the ontology by retrieving the release date of an album (an instance of Cl_Album) via its :release_date property. For example, to retrieve the release date of an album (optionally filtered by a specific album name), under a closed-world assumption the following SPARQL query can be used:

---------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?release_date
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :release_date ?release_date .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel. }
  
  # If desired, filter for a specific album (e.g., "Stadium Arcadium"):
  # FILTER (STR(?albumLabel) = "Stadium Arcadium")
}
---------------------

This query extracts the album and its release date, showing that the competency question is answerable given the provided ontology.
