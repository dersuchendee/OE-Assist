**Yes**

Assuming that albums are connected via a reified release event (for example, using the property :hasReleaseDate which links an album to an album release event having a :releaseDate), you can extract the release date for a given album with the following SPARQL query:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumName ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :albumName ?albumName .
  ?album :hasReleaseDate ?releaseEvent .
  ?releaseEvent :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  FILTER(?albumName = "Stadium Arcadium")
}
---------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the competency question “When was a certain album released?” is answerable using the ontology under the closed world assumption.
