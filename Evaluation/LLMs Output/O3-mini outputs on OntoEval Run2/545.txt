**Yes**

Assuming that album release information is reified in the ontology via the Cl_AlbumRelease class and its associated properties (releasedOn and releaseDate), the CQ “When was a certain album released?” can be answered. For example, the following SPARQL query extracts the release date for albums (optionally filtering to a specific album via its label):

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  
  ?album :releasedOn ?albumRelease .
  ?albumRelease :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  
  # Uncomment the following line to restrict results to a specific album:
  # FILTER(?albumLabel = "Stadium Arcadium")
}
ORDER BY ?albumLabel
--------------------------------

This query uses the closed-world assumption on the ontology and retrieves, for each album, any reified release information along with its corresponding release date.
