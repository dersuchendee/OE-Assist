**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves albums along with their release dates. Under the closed world assumption, if an album’s release date is recorded explicitly in the ontology (as exemplified with Stadium_Arcadium), the CQ “When was a certain album released?” can be answered:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
