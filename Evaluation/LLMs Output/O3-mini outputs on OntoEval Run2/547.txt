**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves albums with their release date (under a closed‐world assumption all such assertions are explicitly stated):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate 
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question “When was a certain album released?” is answerable by the ontology.
