**Yes**

We can answer the CQ ("When was a certain album released?") using the ontology because the albumâ€™s release date is modelled as a datatype property (e.g. :releaseDate) on the album instance (of class :Cl_Album). Under the closed world assumption we assume that all available data is explicitly asserted. For example, the album :StadiumArcadium has the release date "2006-05-05". The following SPARQL query returns the release date for all albums (or you can restrict it to a specific album):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}

This query answers the CQ by extracting the album release date from the ontology.
