**Yes**
Below is one example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves albums together with their release dates (thus answering “When was a certain album released?”):

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album rdf:type :Cl_Album ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  # Optionally, restrict to a specific album by name or IRI:
  # FILTER(STR(?album) = "StadiumArcadium")
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question by providing the necessary release date information for albums.
