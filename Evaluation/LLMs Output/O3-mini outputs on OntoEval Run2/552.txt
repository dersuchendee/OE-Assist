**Yes**  
Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves an album’s release date from the ontology. In this query we assume that albums are individuals of type Cl_Album and that the release date is stored via the property albumReleaseDate.

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel. }
  ?album :albumReleaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “When was a certain album released?” by extracting the release date for each album (or a specific album if further filtered), according to the information available in the ontology.
