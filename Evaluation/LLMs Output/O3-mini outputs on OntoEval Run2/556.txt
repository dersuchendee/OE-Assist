**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the release date for any album (and thus can be used to answer “When was a certain album released?”):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate 
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
------------------------------------------------

In a use case you might bind a specific album (for example, the “Stadium Arcadium” album) by adding a FILTER or binding its IRI to answer the CQ.
