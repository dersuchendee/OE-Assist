**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the release date for a given album (e.g. "Stadium Arcadium") by following the re‐ification structure defined in the ontology:

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releasedOn ?albumRelease .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  ?albumRelease :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  
  # Filter for a specific album (adjust the literal as needed)
  FILTER (?albumLabel = "Stadium Arcadium")
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “When was a certain album released?” using the reified relationship between an album and its release (Cl_AlbumRelease), in the context of the closed world assumption.
