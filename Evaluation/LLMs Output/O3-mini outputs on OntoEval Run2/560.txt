Below is an example SPARQL query that uses the reification class (here :Cl_TrackRecording) to retrieve, for a given track recording instance, the song (a :Cl_MusicalWork instance) that it is a recording of. (Replace :specificTrackRecording below with the IRI of the specific track if needed.)

SELECT ?song ?compositionDate

  # Assuming we have a known track recording instance;

  :specificTrackRecording a :Cl_TrackRecording ;
                           :op_isRecordingOf ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song :dp_compositionDate ?compositionDate . }
}

This query demonstrates how the ontology models the reified recording relationship: a track recording (:Cl_TrackRecording) is connected to a song (of type :Cl_MusicalWork) via the property :op_isRecordingOf.
