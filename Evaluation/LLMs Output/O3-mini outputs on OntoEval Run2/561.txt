**Yes**

Below is one way to write a SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the song (which is modelled as a track that is also an instance of ns1:Song) along with its label and composition date for the specific track (in this example, ns1:HumpDeBump):

PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?track ?songLabel ?composedOn
WHERE {
  VALUES ?track { ns1:HumpDeBump } .
  ?track a ns1:Track, ns1:Song ;
         rdfs:label ?songLabel ;
         ns1:composedOn ?composedOn .
}

This query answers the competency question by extracting the information for the specific track (here, Hump de Bump) that is recorded as a song in the ontology.
