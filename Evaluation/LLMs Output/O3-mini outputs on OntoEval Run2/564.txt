**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, given a specific track (identified by its IRI), returns the song it is a recording of:

───────────────────────────── 
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?track ?trackTitle ?song ?songTitle
WHERE {
  ?track a :Track ;
         :trackTitle ?trackTitle ;
         :isRecordingOf ?song .
  ?song :songTitle ?songTitle .
  # Replace <SPECIFIC_TRACK_IRI> with the IRI of the track you are interested in:
  FILTER(?track = <SPECIFIC_TRACK_IRI>)
}
───────────────────────────── 

This query is answerable because the ontology models the relationship between a Track and the Song it is a recording of using the property :isRecordingOf, and the closed world assumption allows us to assume only the explicitly stated triples exist.
