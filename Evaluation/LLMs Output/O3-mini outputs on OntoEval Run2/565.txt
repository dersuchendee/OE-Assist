**No**

The given ontology does not include an explicit property or structure that connects a specific track (an instance of :Cl_Track) to the song that it is a recording of. In other words, there is no property such as :isRecordingOf or a reified relationship that explicitly states “this track records that song.” Under the closed world assumption, we cannot assume any implicit connection between :Cl_Track and :Cl_Song.

Below is a SPARQL query that returns the available details about tracks. Although it does not return the associated song (since that relation is not modelled), it provides a partial answer by listing the tracks and any associated labels:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?track ?trackLabel
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  OPTIONAL { ?track rdfs:label ?trackLabel . }
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves all instances of :Cl_Track and their labels (if provided), which is a partial answer given the missing connection between tracks and songs in the ontology.
