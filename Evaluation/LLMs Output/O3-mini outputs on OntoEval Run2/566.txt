**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given track, the song it is a recording of (using the closed‚Äêworld assumption that the properties and classes in the ontology capture the intended associations):

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?track ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {  
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?trackRecording .
  ?trackRecording :recordedSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  
  # For a specific track, bind its URI (replace :SpecificTrack with the actual track identifier)
  FILTER(?track = :SpecificTrack)
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this query, a track (an instance of Cl_Track) is linked via the property isRecordingOf to its associated recording entity which in turn is linked by recordedSong to the song. This answers the CQ "What song is a specific track a recording of?"
