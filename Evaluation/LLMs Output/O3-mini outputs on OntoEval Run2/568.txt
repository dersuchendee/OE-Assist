**Yes**

Assuming that a “specific track” is identified by its IRI (or label), we can retrieve the song that the given track is a recording of by leveraging the two properties defined in the ontology: the track’s property :isRecordingOf (with domain Cl_Track) links the track to a recording instance (of type Cl_TrackRecording) and the song’s property :hasRecording (with domain Cl_Song) links that recording back to a song. Under a closed-world assumption, only recordings explicitly stated in the data are considered.

For example, if the specific track’s IRI is provided as ?track, the following SPARQL query extracts the song:

-----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track ;
         :isRecordingOf ?recording .
  
  ?song a :Cl_Song ;
        :hasRecording ?recording .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  
  # If a specific track IRI is known, e.g., <http://www.example.org/test#Track1>, use:
  FILTER( ?track = <http://www.example.org/test#Track1> )
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the CQ by extracting the song for a given specific track via the recording link established in the ontology.
