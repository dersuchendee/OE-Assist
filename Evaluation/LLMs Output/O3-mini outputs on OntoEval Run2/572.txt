**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that retrieves each track paired with the song it is recorded of (using the :isRecordingOf property):

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track rdf:type :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?song .
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology properly connects a track to its underlying song, thus answering the competency question "What song is a specific track a recording of?" under the closed‚Äêworld assumption.
