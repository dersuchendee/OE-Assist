**Yes**

Assuming the specific track is identified by a URI (e.g., :SpecificTrack), you can extract the song that the track is a recording of with the following SPARQL query:

-----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?song
WHERE {
  :SpecificTrack a :Cl_Track ;
                 :trackOf ?song .
}
-----------------------------------------

This query uses the ontologyâ€™s definition where tracks (of type :Cl_Track) are linked to the song (of type :Cl_Song) they record via the :trackOf property.
