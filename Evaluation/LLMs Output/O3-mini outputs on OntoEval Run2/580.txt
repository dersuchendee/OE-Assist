**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a specific track, retrieves the song of which it is a recording:

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?track ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?trackRecording .
  ?trackRecording :recordedSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  
  # Replace the URI below with the specific track you wish to query
  FILTER(?track = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificTrack>)
}
--------------------------------

In this query, a track (of type Cl_Track) is linked via the property isRecordingOf to a reified track recording instance; then the property recordedSong is used to retrieve the song. This shows that the CQ is fully supported by the ontology.
