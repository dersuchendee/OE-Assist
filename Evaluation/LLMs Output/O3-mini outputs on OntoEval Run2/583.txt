**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that answers the CQ by extracting the composition date of a song (e.g., “Hump de Bump”), which is connected through the reified class structure in the ontology:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?songName ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song ;
        :hasCompositionDate ?compositionDate ;
        :hasName ?songName .
  FILTER(LCASE(STR(?songName)) = LCASE("Hump de Bump"))
}

This query shows that the ontology supports the CQ “When was a certain song composed?” under the closed world assumption, making it fully answerable.
