**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, returns for each song in the ontology its associated composition date (via its reified composition instance):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?songName ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song :songName ?songName . }
  ?song :hasComposition ?comp .
  ?comp :composedOn ?compositionDate .
}
ORDER BY ?song

This query answers the competency question “When was a certain song composed?” by retrieving, for each song individual, the date it was composed as recorded in its associated Cl_SongComposition instance.
