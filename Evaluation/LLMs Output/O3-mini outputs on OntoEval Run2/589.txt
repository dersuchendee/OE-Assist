SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :composedSong ?songComposition .
  ?songComposition :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
```

In this query we extract the composition date for each song by following the relationship between Cl_Song and its associated Cl_SongComposition, which holds the date through the property :compositionDate.
