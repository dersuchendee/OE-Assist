**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each song, the date on which it was composed:

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song ;
        :composedOn ?songComposition .
  ?songComposition :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
ORDER BY ?song
----------------------------------

This query works under the closed world assumption and extracts the answer to the competency question "When was a certain song composed?" by utilizing the ontologyâ€™s classes (Cl_Song, Cl_SongComposition) and properties (composedOn, compositionDate).
