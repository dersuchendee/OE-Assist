**Yes**

We can extract the composition date of a given song using the reified concept Cl_SongComposition with its properties. For example, the following SPARQL query returns each song (linked via composedOn) along with its composition date (from compositionDate):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Cl_SongComposition ;
               :composedOn ?song ;
               :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question "When was a certain song composed?" under the closed world assumption.
