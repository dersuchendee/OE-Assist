**Yes**

Assuming a “certain song” is one that can be identified (for example via its IRI or label), the ontology provides a data property (:composedOn) on instances of :Cl_Song that records the composition date. Under the closed‐world assumption you can extract the answer by querying for songs that have a value for :composedOn. For example:

-----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?composedOn
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :composedOn ?composedOn .
}
-----------------------------------------

This query returns each song and the date on which it was composed.
