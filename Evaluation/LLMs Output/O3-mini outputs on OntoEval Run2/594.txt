**Yes**

The ontology defines a class for songs (Cl_Song) and a data property (compositionDate) with domain Cl_Song. Therefore, we can extract the composition date for a song (e.g., “Hump de Bump”) using a SPARQL query under the closed world assumption. For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song rdf:type :Cl_Song .
  ?song :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
  FILTER(?song = :HumpDeBump)
}

This query returns the composition date for the specified song, which answers the competency question "When was a certain song composed?"
