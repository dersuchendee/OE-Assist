**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves performances along with their linked geographic location (city), and (optionally) the region and country in which they are located:

─────────────────────────────────────────────

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?performance ?city ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceLocation ?city .
  ?city a :Cl_City ;
        :locatedInRegion ?region .
  ?region a :Cl_Region ;
          :locatedInCountry ?country .
}
ORDER BY ?performance

─────────────────────────────────────────────

This query assumes that every performance has a location (of type Cl_City) and that the city is linked via the property :locatedInRegion to a region which, in turn, is linked via :locatedInCountry to a country. Under the closed‐world assumption (i.e. no “unknown” facts exist beyond what is specified in the ontology), this query extracts a complete answer to the question “What is the geographic location of each performance?”
