**Yes**

We can answer “When was a certain song composed?” by retrieving the composition date from songs (instances of :Cl_Song) via the :composedDate data property. Under the closed world assumption (i.e. only those song instances explicitly stating a composed date will be returned), the following SPARQL query delivers the answer:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?composedDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song ;
        :composedDate ?composedDate .
}
---------------------------------

This query assumes that the song of interest is among those explicitly described in the ontology with a composed date.
