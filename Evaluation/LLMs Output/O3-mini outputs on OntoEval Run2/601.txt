**Yes**

We can retrieve the composition date for a given song from the ontology. For instance, a SPARQL query to get the composition date for a specific song would be:

————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
  # Replace <specific_song_IRI> with the IRI of the song of interest
  FILTER(?song = <specific_song_IRI>)
}
————————————————————————————

In a closed world assumption the ontology includes all songs and their associated composition dates, so the competency question “When was a certain song composed?” is answerable.
