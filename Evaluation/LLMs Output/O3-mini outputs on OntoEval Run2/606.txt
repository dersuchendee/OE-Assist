**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the review text provided by a given critic (e.g. “Crian Hiatt”) on a record (album):

──────────────────────────────
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
 
SELECT ?record ?recordName ?review
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Album ;
          :hasReview ?review ;
          :reviewedBy ?critic .
  OPTIONAL { ?record :hasName ?recordName . }
  ?critic :hasName "Crian Hiatt" .
}
──────────────────────────────

Under the closed‐world assumption, we assume that only the facts explicitly present in the ontology hold, so this query extracts the answer to “What does a certain critic say about a certain record?” when the critic is "Crian Hiatt."
