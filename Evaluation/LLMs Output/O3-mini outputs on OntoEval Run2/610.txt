**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that answers the competency question “What does a certain critic say about a certain record?” by retrieving the review content written by the given critic about the given record (in this ontology, a “record” is modelled as an Album that is the subject of a Review):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?criticName ?albumTitle ?reviewContent
WHERE {
  ?review a :Review ;
          :writtenBy ?critic ;
          :isReviewOf ?record ;
          :reviewContent ?reviewContent .
  ?critic :criticName ?criticName .
  ?record :albumTitle ?albumTitle .
  # You can replace the following IRIs with the specific critic and record you want to query.
  FILTER(?critic = :CrianHiatt && ?record = :StadiumArcadium)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query is answerable under a closed‐world assumption, since it directly matches the individuals and properties defined in the ontology.
