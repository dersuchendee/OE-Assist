**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the review text written by a given critic on a given record (album). In this query we assume that the critic and the record are identified by label values (adjust the FILTER values as needed):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?critic ?record ?reviewText
WHERE {
  ?critic a :Cl_Critic ;
          rdfs:label ?criticLabel ;
          :reviews ?review .
  
  ?review :reviewText ?reviewText ;
          :reviewedAlbum ?record .
  
  ?record a :Cl_Album ;
          rdfs:label ?recordLabel .
  
  # Filter to a specific critic and record (adjust literal values as required)
  FILTER(STR(?criticLabel) = "Crian Hiatt")
  FILTER(STR(?recordLabel) = "Stadium Arcadium")
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question "What does a certain critic say about a certain record?" by linking a critic instance, a review instance and a record (album) instance.
