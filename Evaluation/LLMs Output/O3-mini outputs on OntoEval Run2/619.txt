**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the critic, the record (album), and the review text, which shows what a certain critic said about a certain record:

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?critic ?record ?reviewText
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_Review ;
          :reviewedBy ?critic ;
          :reviewedRecord ?record ;
          :reviewText ?reviewText .
}
-------------------------------------------------------------

This query assumes the ontology models reviews as instances of :Cl_Review that reify the review relationship between a critic (of type :Cl_Critic) and a record (for example, an instance of :Cl_Album), with the review text captured by the :reviewText property.
