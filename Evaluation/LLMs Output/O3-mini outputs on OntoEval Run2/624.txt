**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves a review written by a specific critic about a specified record (album):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?reviewContent
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :writtenBy ?critic .
  ?review :reviewContent ?reviewContent .
  
  # Replace the following IRIs with the actual critic and album of interest
  FILTER(?critic = <http://www.example.org/test#CriticExample> &&
         ?album = <http://www.example.org/test#AlbumExample>)
}
------------------------------------------------

In this query, we assume that:
– The record is represented as an instance of :Cl_Album.
– The review associated with the album is linked via :hasReview.
– The review is written by a critic (an instance of :Cl_Critic) using the property :writtenBy.
– The content of the review is captured by the property :reviewContent.

This query demonstrates that the competency question “What does a certain critic say about a certain record?” is fully modeled by the ontology.
