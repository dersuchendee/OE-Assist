**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves each performance along with its label and performance date:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  ?performance :hasPerformanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate
------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology includes the necessary information (via the :hasPerformanceDate property) to answer the CQ "When did a certain performance take place?" under a closed world assumption.
