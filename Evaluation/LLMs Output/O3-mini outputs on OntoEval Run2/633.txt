**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given performance, its associated time interval (with its start and end dates), thereby answering the competency question “When did a certain performance take place?” under the closed world assumption:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  ?performance :hasTimeInterval ?interval .
  ?interval :startDate ?startDate .
  ?interval :endDate ?endDate .
}
ORDER BY ?performance
————————————————————————————

This query extracts the performance(s) along with their associated start and end dates from the ontology, demonstrating that the CQ is indeed modelled by the ontology.
