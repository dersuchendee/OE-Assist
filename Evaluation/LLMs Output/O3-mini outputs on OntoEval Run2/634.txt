**Yes**

The following SPARQL query retrieves performances along with the date on which each took place by following the performance reification via the Cl_PerformanceEvent and its date property:

---------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceEvent ?event .
  ?event :performanceEventDate ?date .
}
ORDER BY ?performance
---------------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, this query will extract the expected performance dates defined in the ontology for each performance, confirming that the CQ “When did a certain performance take place?” is supported by the ontology.
