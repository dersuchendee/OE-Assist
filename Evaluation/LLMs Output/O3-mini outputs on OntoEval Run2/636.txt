**Yes**

Assuming that performances are modelled by the class Cl_Performance (or a subclass such as Cl_BandPerformance) and that the performance’s time is recorded via the property performanceDate, you can extract the date(s) for a given performance using a query such as:

--------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate 
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
--------------------------------------------------------

Under the closed‐world assumption, this query will return the performance(s) along with the date(s) on which these performances took place.
