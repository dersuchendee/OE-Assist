**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves every performance and its associated performance date (using the properties and classes from the ontology):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}

This query directly extracts the date a particular performance took place, which shows that the competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" is fully answerable with the provided ontology.
