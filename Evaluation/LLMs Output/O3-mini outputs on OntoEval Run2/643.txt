**Yes**

This CQ is fully supported by the ontology because performances are modelled as individuals of type Cl_Performance with an associated data property :performanceDate. Under a closed world assumption we can confidently query for the performance date. For example, the following SPARQL query returns the date(s) when a performance took place:

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate
