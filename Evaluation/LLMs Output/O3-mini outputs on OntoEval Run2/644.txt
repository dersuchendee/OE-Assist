**Yes**

Assuming instances of the class Cl_Performance are populated with their performance dates using the property performanceDate, you can retrieve the date of a given performance with a query like:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
  
This query returns each performance along with the date when it took place, which supports the competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" under the closed world assumption.
