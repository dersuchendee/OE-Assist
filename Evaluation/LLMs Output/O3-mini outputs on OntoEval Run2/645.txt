**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves performances and their associated time (using the “performedDuring” property):

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?time
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedDuring ?time .
}
ORDER BY ?time
-------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question “When did a certain performance take place?” since the performance’s date is explicitly modelled with the “performedDuring” property.
