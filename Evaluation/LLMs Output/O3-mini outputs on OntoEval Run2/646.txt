**Yes**

Assuming that “a certain performance” can be identified by its membership in the Cl_Performance class and that its performance date is recorded by the :performanceDate data property, you can answer the CQ with a query like this (under a closed world assumption):

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate
-------------------------------------------------

This query extracts all instances of Cl_Performance along with the date when each performance took place, thus fully supporting the competency question.
