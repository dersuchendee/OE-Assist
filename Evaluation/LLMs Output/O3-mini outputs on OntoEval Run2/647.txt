**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves each performance along with the date at which it took place, using the class and property definitions from the ontology:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?participation a :Cl_PerformanceParticipation ;
                 :performance ?performance ;
                 :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate
------------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology models the CQ "When did a certain performance take place?" since the performance date information is available (via the property :performanceDate on individuals of :Cl_PerformanceParticipation) under the closed world assumption.
