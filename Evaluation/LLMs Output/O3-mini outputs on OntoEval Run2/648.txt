**Yes**

Assuming the ontology uses the reification class Cl_Performance and the performedOn property (with xsd:date) to associate a date with each performance, the competency question “When did a certain performance take place?” is supported. Under the closed world assumption, we can query explicitly for those individuals of type Cl_Performance that have a performedOn date recorded. For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedOn ?date .
}

This query will return the performance(s) along with the date when they took place.
