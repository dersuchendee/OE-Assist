**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves performances along with the date when they took place. It uses the reification classes and properties defined in the ontologyâ€”specifically, it looks for individuals of type Cl_Performance and then follows the performedOn property to get a Cl_PerformanceDate individual, from which the performanceDate (an xsd:date) is retrieved.

SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedOn ?performanceDate .
  ?performanceDate :performanceDate ?date .
}

This query demonstrates that the competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" is answerable given the ontology structure.
