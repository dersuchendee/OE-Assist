**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, extracts the songs played in a given performance using the reified connection in the ontology:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceName ?song ?songName
WHERE {
  # A specific performance; replace <#SpecificPerformance> with the actual performance IRI if needed
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :hasName ?performanceName . }
  
  # A reified performance-song instance that connects a performance with a song
  ?perfSong a :Cl_PerformanceSong ;
            :performanceOf ?performance ;
            :songPlayed ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song :hasName ?songName . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query, we first select a performance and then use the reification class Cl_PerformanceSong (via its object properties :performanceOf and :songPlayed) to retrieve the songs played in that performance.
