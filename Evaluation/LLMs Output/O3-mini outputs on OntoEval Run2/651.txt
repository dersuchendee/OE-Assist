**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, extracts the songs played in a specific performance (here, for example, the performance identified by :PerformancePortland2006):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  :PerformancePortland2006 :hasSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel. }
}
------------------------------------------------

This query directly answers the CQ by retrieving the song (and its label, if available) that was played in the designated performance.
