**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves for a given performance event the songs played (and, optionally, their titles and the performance’s date):

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?song ?songTitle
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?performance :hasPerformance ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song :hasTitle ?songTitle . }
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :hasPerformanceDate ?performanceDate . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

In this query, we assume that a performance event (of type Cl_PerformanceEvent) is linked to the songs played via the property :hasPerformance. (This property is part of the reified modelling where performance-song associations appear.) Under the closed‐world assumption only the information explicitly stated in the ontology is returned.
