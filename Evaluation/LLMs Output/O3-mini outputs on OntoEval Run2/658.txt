**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that uses the reified structure in the ontology to retrieve, for a given performance, the songs that were played:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedSong ?performanceSong .
  ?performanceSong :songPerformed ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  # Uncomment and adjust the following FILTER to select a particular performance if needed:
  # FILTER(?performance = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificPerformance>)
}
--------------------------------------------------

Under a closed world assumption, this query will return the songs reified via the intermediate class (Cl_PerformanceSong) that have been associated with the queried performance, thereby answering the competency question.
