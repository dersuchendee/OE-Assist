**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that returns, for a given performance, the songs that were played:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :playedSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song

This query works under the closed‐world assumption using the ontology’s definitions of a performance (:Cl_Performance) and how songs are played (via the :playedSong property connecting a performance with a :Cl_Song or its subclass :Cl_PerformanceSong).
