**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the songs played during each performance by following the reified relationship through a performance’s setlist:

—————————————————————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate. }
  
  ?performance :hasSetlist ?setlist .
  ?setlist :includesSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?performanceDate ?song
—————————————————————————————————————————————

In a closed world view (assuming that if a performance is present then its setlist must specify all performed songs), this query fully answers the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" by retrieving the songs linked to each performance.
