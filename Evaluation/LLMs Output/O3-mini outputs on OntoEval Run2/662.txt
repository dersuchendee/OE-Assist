**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption and using the ontologyâ€™s reified performance setlist structure, retrieves the songs played in a given performance:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  # Identify a performance of interest
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }

  # Find the associated setlist linking the performance to the songs played
  ?setlist a :Cl_PerformanceSetlist ;
           :performedDuring ?performance ;
           :includesSong ?song .

  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance
---------------------------------

This query answers the CQ "What songs were played in a certain performance?" by linking a given performance to its setlist (via :performedDuring) and then retrieving all songs included in that setlist (using :includesSong).
