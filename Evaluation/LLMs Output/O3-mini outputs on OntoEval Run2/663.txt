**Yes**

The following SPARQL query retrieves the songs that were played in a specific performance. In this example the performance is assumed to be known (here :PortlandPerformance), from which the query finds the associated performance setlist, and then extracts the songs included:

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  # A performance setlist links a performance with its songs
  ?setlist a :Cl_PerformanceSetlist ;
           :performedIn ?performance ;
           :includesSong ?song .
  
  # Optionally retrieve human‚Äêreadable labels
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel. }
  
  # Filter for a specific performance (e.g., PortlandPerformance)
  FILTER(?performance = :PortlandPerformance)
}
ORDER BY ?songLabel
----------------------------------

In a closed world scenario, if no songs are asserted for a given performance the query returns no results, effectively showing complete information available from the ontology.
