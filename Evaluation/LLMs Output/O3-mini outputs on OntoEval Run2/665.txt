**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the tracks contained in each album. In the ontology, every instance of Cl_Album is required (via the minCardinality restriction on :containsTrack) to have at least one related track. Therefore this query fully answers the competency question.

SELECT DISTINCT ?album ?track
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
ORDER BY ?album ?track
------------------------------------------------

This query extracts for each album its associated track(s), thereby verifying that the crucial constraint (each album must contain at least one track) is modelled in the ontology.
