**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for every performance the songs that were played (via the reified performance–song relationship):

-----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  
  ?perfSong a :Cl_PerformanceSong .
  ?perfSong :performedAt ?performance .
  ?perfSong :performedSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance
-----------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" by retrieving the songs (and, optionally, their labels) associated with each performance via the :performedAt and :performedSong properties.
