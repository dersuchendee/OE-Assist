**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves the songs played during performances. (Under a closed‐world assumption, only performances explicitly linked through the property “performedSongs” to a song are taken into account.)

---------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedSongs ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song
---------------------------------------------

This query returns each performance, its date (if available), and the songs (with labels when provided) that were played.
