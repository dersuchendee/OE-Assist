We can answer the CQ “What songs were played in a certain performance?” by taking advantage of the reified structure for performances. In the ontology, a performance (an instance of Cl_Performance) is connected to one or more performed songs via the object property :includesSong. Each performed song (of type Cl_PerformedSong) then indicates which song was played using the property :songPerformed (with range Cl_Song).

Below is a SPARQL query (assuming a closed world on the provided ontology) to extract, for a given performance, the songs that were played:

--------------------------------------------------

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  
  ?performance :includesSong ?performedSong .
  ?performedSong :songPerformed ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song

--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves each performance along with its label (if present) and the songs played, using the reified structure defined in the ontology.
