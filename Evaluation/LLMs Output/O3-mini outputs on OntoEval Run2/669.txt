**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that—assuming the ontology’s use of the Cl_Performance class and the object property featuresSong (which links a performance to its played songs)—retrieves the songs played in a specified performance:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :featuresSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  # Filter to a specific performance (replace :Performance1 with the URI of the performance in question)
  FILTER (?performance = :Performance1)
}
------------------------------------------------

In a closed-world scenario, only those songs explicitly related via the :featuresSong property will be returned.
