**No**

The ontology does capture some aspects of "resources" (their type, composition, and usage in a circular value network) but the CQ “Give me information about this resource” cannot be fully answered using a reified/pivot structure in the ontology (i.e. a dedicated membership class such as Cl_ResourceUsage linking all the relevant details) as required. A partial answer is possible by querying for the basic resource properties.

For example, a partial SPARQL query extracting available resource details is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?resource ?composition ?compositionLevel ?resourceType ?partOf ?usedIn ?mainFocusOf
WHERE {
  ?resource a :Cl_Resource .
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :hasComposition ?composition. }
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :hasCompositionLevel ?compositionLevel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :isTypeOf ?resourceType. }
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :isPartOf ?partOf. }
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :usedIn ?usedIn. }
  OPTIONAL { ?resource :mainFocusOf ?mainFocusOf. }
} 

# Under the closed world assumption, only explicitly asserted information is returned.
