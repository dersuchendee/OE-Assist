**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that finds, for each performance, the songs played by making use of the reified relationship via the Cl_SongPerformance class:

------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?songPerf a :Cl_SongPerformance .
  ?songPerf :inPerformance ?performance .
  ?songPerf :performedSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song
------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology provides the necessary classes and properties to extract the answer to the CQ “What songs were played in a certain performance?” under a closed world assumption.
