**Yes**

We can write a SPARQL query that, given a performance (or listing all performances), retrieves the songs played in that performance via the performedSongs property from the Cl_Performance class. Under the closedâ€‘world assumption, we assume that the only songs played at a performance are those explicitly linked by the performedSongs property. For example:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedSongs ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  # If you want to query one particular performance, you can add:
  # FILTER(?performance = <http://www.example.org/test#performance123>)
}
------------------------------------------------

This query fully answers the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" as it retrieves all songs linked by the performedSongs property from the performance(s) in the ontology.
