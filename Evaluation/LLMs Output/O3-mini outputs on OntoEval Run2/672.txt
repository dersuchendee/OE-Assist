Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves—for each performance—the songs played by first following the “performedSongs” relation (yielding a reified performance song) and then following “includesSong” to link to the actual song:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel 
WHERE {  
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  
  ?performance :performedSongs ?perfSong .
  ?perfSong :includesSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song
