**Yes**

Assuming a specific performance is identified by its association with a venue via the property :performedAt, the following SPARQL query fully extracts the answer to the competency question under the closed world assumption:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?venue ?venueLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance .
  ?performance :performedAt ?venue .

  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?venue rdfs:label ?venueLabel . }
}
------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves all performances along with their associated venues, thereby answering "Where did a certain performance take place?" by linking each performance to its venue.
