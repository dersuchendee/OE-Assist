**Yes**

We can answer this competency question because the ontology represents performance events along with a location via the data property “hasLocation”. Assuming that performances are modelled (for example, as instances of :Cl_PerformanceEvent or a subclass like :Cl_LivePerformance) and that their location is provided by the property “:hasLocation”, we can write a SPARQL query to extract the locations for performance events.

For example, under the closed‐world assumption the following query retrieves the performance along with its performance date (if available) and its location:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?performance :hasLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :hasPerformanceDate ?performanceDate . }
}

This query extracts all performances that have a location defined.
