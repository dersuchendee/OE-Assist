**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, returns the location (place) of a given performance by following the “takesPlaceAt” property from a Performance:
  
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?place ?placeName
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Performance ;
               :takesPlaceAt ?place .
  OPTIONAL { ?place :placeName ?placeName . }
} 

This query confirms that the ontology models the CQ “Where did a certain performance take place?” by retrieving the performance and its associated place.
