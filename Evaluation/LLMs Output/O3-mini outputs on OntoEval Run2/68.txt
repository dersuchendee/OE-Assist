**Yes**

We can answer the CQ “Give me information about this resource” because the ontology provides a class hierarchy (e.g., Resource, Product, Component, Material) with associated datatype and object properties (like rdfs:label, rdfs:comment, hasType, hasComposition, isUsedIn, etc.). Under a closed world assumption, we can write a SPARQL query to fetch all available information about resource instances. For example:

-------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/circular_value_network#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?resource ?property ?value
WHERE {
  ?resource a :Resource .
  ?resource ?property ?value .
}
ORDER BY ?resource ?property
-------------------------------

This query returns all triples about each instance of Resource, which effectively “gives information” about the resource as required by the competency question.
