**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves each performance event (the reified representation of a performance) along with its associated location. (Replace the FILTER value with the identifier of the “certain performance” if you wish to inspect a specific one.)

SELECT ?performanceEvent ?location ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?performanceEvent a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?performanceEvent :performedAt ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location :locationName ?locationName . }
  # Uncomment and edit the following filter to restrict to a specific performance:
  # FILTER(?performanceEvent = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificPerformanceID>)
}
-------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
• The ontology models performances using the reified class :Cl_PerformanceEvent.
• The object property :performedAt (with domain :Cl_PerformanceEvent and range :Cl_Location) associates a performance event with its location.
• The OPTIONAL clause attempts to retrieve a human‐readable name (using the data property :locationName) if available.
• Under the closed-world assumption, only those performance events that have an explicitly stated location are returned.
