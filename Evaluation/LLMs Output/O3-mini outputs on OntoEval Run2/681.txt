**Yes**

```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceLocation ?perfLocation .
  ?perfLocation :locationOfPerformance ?location .
}
```

Explanation:
The ontology defines a class for performances (:Cl_Performance) that has an associated property :performanceLocation (with range :Cl_PerformanceLocation). In turn, :Cl_PerformanceLocation is linked to a concrete location via the property :locationOfPerformance (whose range is :Cl_Location). Under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, this query retrieves the corresponding location for any given performance, and hence the competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" is answerable by the ontology.
