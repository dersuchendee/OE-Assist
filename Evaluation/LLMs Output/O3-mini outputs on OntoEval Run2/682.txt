**Yes**

Below is one valid SPARQL query that retrieves each performance together with the location at which it took place (using the property “takesPlaceAt” and the connection to a location via “locationOf”):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :takesPlaceAt ?perfLocation .
  ?perfLocation :locationOf ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}

This query assumes the closed‐world view of the ontology. Since the ontology defines that performances are linked via “takesPlaceAt” to a performance location and that locations are further related by “locationOf”, the competency question “Where did a certain performance take place?” can be answered using this query.
