**Yes**

Assuming the closed‚Äêworld view (i.e. only the explicitly stated relationships exist), the performance where the live event took place can be retrieved using the property that connects a performance individual (of type Cl_Performance) to the venue (of type Cl_Venue) via the :performedIn relation.

For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves the performance, its performance date (if available), and the venue where it took place:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?venue
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedIn ?venue .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate . }
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports the competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" by explicitly linking a performance (e.g. :PerformanceStadiumArcadiumPortland) to its venue (e.g. :Portland_Oregon).
