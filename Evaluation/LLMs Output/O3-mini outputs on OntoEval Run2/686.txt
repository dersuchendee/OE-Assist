**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves where a specific performance took place by following the links from a Cl_Performance instance to its venue and further location details:

---------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?venue ?city ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate ;
               :takesPlaceIn ?venue .
  OPTIONAL { ?venue :locatedIn ?city . }
  OPTIONAL { ?city :isLocatedIn ?region . }
  OPTIONAL { ?region :isPartOf ?country . }
  
  # For a particular performance, e.g., PortlandPerformance:
  FILTER(?performance = :PortlandPerformance)
}
---------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports answering the competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" under a closed world assumption.
