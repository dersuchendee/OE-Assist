**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the performance and its (closed‐world assumed) location:

─────────────────────────────

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceLocation ?location .
}

─────────────────────────────

This query will return the performance instance(s) along with their associated location(s), which answers the competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" according to the provided ontology.
