**Yes**

We can answer this CQ using the ontology because it includes the class Cl_Performance along with an object property :performanceLocation that connects a performance to a location (of type Cl_Location). Using the closed world assumption, we assume that every performance that took place has its location specified using the property.

For example, a SPARQL query to retrieve a certain performanceâ€™s location could be:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
  # You can narrow the query to a specific performance URI with a FILTER clause, e.g.,
  # FILTER(?performance = <http://www.example.org/test#Performance123>)
}
---------------------------------

This query extracts each performance along with the corresponding location where it took place.
