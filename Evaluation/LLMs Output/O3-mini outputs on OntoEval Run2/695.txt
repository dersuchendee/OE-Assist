**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves each performance along with the location where it took place:

-----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedAt ?location .
}
-----------------------------------------

In this query we assume that performances are instances of :Cl_Performance and that the property :performedAt links a performance to its location (which is an instance of :Cl_PerformanceLocation and/or a location class). Under the closed world assumption, only the explicitly stated triples are returned.
