**Yes**

We can answer the CQ with the following SPARQL query. Under the closed world assumption, only cities with an explicitly stated region using the property :isLocatedIn will be returned.

----------------------------------------------------------------
SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?region .
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves each individual of type :Cl_City along with the region it is located in (as governed by :isLocatedIn), so the CQ is fully supported by the ontology.
