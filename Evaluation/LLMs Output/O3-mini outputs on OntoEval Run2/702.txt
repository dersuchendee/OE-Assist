**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the region in which a given city is located by following the isPartOf property (including any transitive steps) and filtering the result to regions:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/geo#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :City .
  ?city (:isPartOf)+ ?region .
  ?region a :Region .
  # Optional filter: to target a specific city by name, for example, "Portland"
  # FILTER(?cityName = "Portland")
  OPTIONAL { ?city :placeName ?cityName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?region :placeName ?regionName . }
}
ORDER BY ?city

This query ensures that if a city is part of a region according to the ontology, the region will be returned.
