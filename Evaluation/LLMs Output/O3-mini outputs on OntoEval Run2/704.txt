**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the region for a given city (here represented by the placeholder :SomeCity):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?region ?regionLabel
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityRegion ?cityRegion .
  ?cityRegion :regionOfCity ?region .
  OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionLabel . }
  FILTER(?city = :SomeCity)
}

This query shows that the competency question “In what region is a certain city located?” is answerable using the ontology.
