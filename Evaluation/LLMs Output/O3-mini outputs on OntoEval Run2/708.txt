**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption given in the ontology, extracts the region in which a given city (e.g., Portland_Oregon) is located:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?region .
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query returns the city and its associated region as required by the competency question "In what region is a certain city located?"
