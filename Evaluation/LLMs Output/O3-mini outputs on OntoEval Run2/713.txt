**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each city in the ontology, the region in which it is located (using the :cityInRegion property):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityInRegion ?region .
}

This query answers the competency question “In what region is a certain city located?” under the closed world assumption by extracting the region information linked to each city through the :cityInRegion property.
