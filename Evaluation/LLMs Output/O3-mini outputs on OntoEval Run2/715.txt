**Yes**

Assuming that a “certain city” is represented as an instance of Cl_City and that its region is linked via the property :locatedIn to an instance of Cl_Region, under the closed-world assumption we can write a SPARQL query such as:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?region ?regionLabel
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?region .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionLabel. }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves each city (and its label when available) along with the region in which it is located, thereby answering the competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" within the provided ontology.
