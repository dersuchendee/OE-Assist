**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, given a region (e.g., by its label or identifier), returns the country in which that region is located. For example, if we want to know in what country “Oregon” (an instance of :Cl_Region) is located, we could query as follows:

---------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?region ?regionLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionLabel . }
  ?region :op_isLocatedIn ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
  # Uncomment and adjust the following FILTER if you want to specify a region by label
  # FILTER (lcase(str(?regionLabel)) = "oregon")
}
---------------------------------------------------

This query extracts, for any given region (or a filtered region), the country where that region is located, thereby answering the competency question under the closed world assumption.
