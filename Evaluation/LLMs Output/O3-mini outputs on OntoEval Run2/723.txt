**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology uses the closed‐world assumption and that regions are linked to countries via the property “isPartOf” (as indicated by the restriction that every instance of :Region is related by :isPartOf to an instance of :Country), we can answer the CQ “In what country is a certain region located?” This means that for any region individual in the ontology there should be an asserted (or inferable) relation to a country.

A SPARQL query extracting the answer could be:

------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?region ?regionLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?region a :Region .
  ?region :isPartOf ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?region
------------------------------------

This query retrieves each region, its label (if available), and the country it is (directly) part of along with the country’s label.
