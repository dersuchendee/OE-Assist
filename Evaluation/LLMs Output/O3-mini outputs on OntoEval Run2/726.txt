**Yes**

We can answer the CQ since the ontology includes classes for regions and countries along with a property (partOf) that links a region to its country. Under the closed‐world assumption we expect explicit triples of the form “?region :partOf ?country”. For example, an instance of :Cl_Oregon (a subclass of :Cl_Region) is linked via a restriction to a country (here :Cl_US).

A SPARQL query to extract, for each region, the country in which it is located would be:

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?region ?regionName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region ;
          :partOf ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?region :regionName ?regionName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?country :regionName ?countryName . }
}
--------------------------------

This query retrieves each region, its (optional) name, and the country it is linked to (along with its optional name).
