**Yes**

Assuming that region instances are linked via the property “locatedInCountry” to a country (or to an instance that is also declared as a country), you can run a SPARQL query like:

-----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region ;
          :locatedInCountry ?country .
  # Optional: to be explicit that ?country is a country
  ?country a :Cl_Country .
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

This query extracts, for each region (?region), the associated country (?country) as modelled by the ontology.
