The provided ontology does include classes for regions, countries, and an intermediary “region‐country” class with the properties :locatedInCountry (linking a region to a Cl_RegionCountry) and :hasRegion (linking a country to a Cl_RegionCountry). However, unlike some of the other examples, the connection between a region and its country is not reified via a dedicated membership class (e.g., Cl_Membership) and so under the closed world assumption we cannot be sure that every region–country association is fully captured. Consequently, while we have some information to formulate a partial answer, the CQ is not fully answerable as a reification CQ.

A partial answer can be retrieved by joining the region to the intermediary class and then to the country. For example, you may use a query such as:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  ?region :locatedInCountry ?regionCountry .
  
  ?country a :Cl_Country .
  ?country :hasRegion ?regionCountry .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves regions and their associated countries, which constitutes a partial answer under the closed world assumption.
