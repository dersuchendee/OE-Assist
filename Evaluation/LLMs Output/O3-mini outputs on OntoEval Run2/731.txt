**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the country in which each region (including the “certain region”) is located by using the property “:regionInCountry” defined in the ontology:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region rdf:type :Cl_Region .
  ?region :regionInCountry ?country .
}

This query answers the CQ “In what country is a certain region located?” using the closed world assumption over the provided ontology.
