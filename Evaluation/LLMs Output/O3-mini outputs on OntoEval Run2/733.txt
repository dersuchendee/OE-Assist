**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves each region (an instance of Cl_Region) and the country in which it is located according to the property locatedInCountry:

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region rdf:type :Cl_Region .
  ?region :locatedInCountry ?country .
}
--------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “In what country is a certain region located?” by extracting all regions along with their associated country information from the ontology under a closed world assumption.
