**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each region (instance of Cl_Region), its country using the object property regionInCountry:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region rdf:type :Cl_Region .
  ?region :regionInCountry ?country .
}

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports the competency question "In what country is a certain region located?" under a closed-world assumption.
