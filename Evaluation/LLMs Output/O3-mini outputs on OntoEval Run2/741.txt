**Yes**

We can answer the CQ by writing a SPARQL query that retrieves a region and follows the property chain indicating in what country the region is located. Assuming that regions are instances of :Cl_Region and that the ontology models the relationship using the properties :regionInCountry (with range :Cl_RegionCountry) and then :countryIncludes (with range :Cl_Country), the query below extracts, for each region, the associated country.

For example:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?region ?regionLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionLabel . }
  ?region :regionInCountry ?regionCountry .
  ?regionCountry :countryIncludes ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query returns, for every region in the knowledge base, its country (using the provided property chain).
