**Yes**

We can verify the competency question "A record always contains at least one track" by checking that every Album instance has at least one associated Track via the :hasTrack property. For example, under a closed world assumption the following SPARQL query extracts Albums along with a count of their associated tracks, and by filtering we ensure that only those Albums with one or more tracks are returned:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/musicproduction#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel (COUNT(?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  ?album :hasTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album ?albumLabel
HAVING (COUNT(?track) >= 1)

This query confirms that each album (a record) indeed contains at least one track, satisfying the competency question.
