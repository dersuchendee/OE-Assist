Assuming that festival occurrences (which are subclasses of Cl_TheatreFestival) record their dates using the data property :hasDate and (in this closed‐world model) that the festival “Roma Loves Shakespeare” is represented by an occurrence individual, you can answer “When did a certain theatre festival take place?” with the following SPARQL query. (Here we assume the festival occurrence has a :hasName property matching “Roma Loves Shakespeare” – if not, one would need to link the generic festival individual with its occurrence.)

SELECT ?festivalOccurrence ?date
WHERE {
  ?festivalOccurrence a :Cl_FestivalOccurrence ;
                      :hasName "Roma Loves Shakespeare" ;
                      :hasDate ?date .
}
ORDER BY ?date

This query returns the occurrence(s) of the “Roma Loves Shakespeare” festival together with the date(s) on which it took place.
