**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query. Under the closed‐world assumption, if every record (an instance of Cl_Album) has at least one track (via the property :containsTrack), then the query below should return no “violating” album. (An empty result set confirms that each record contains at least one track.)

SELECT ?album 
WHERE {
  ?album rdf:type :Cl_Album .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?album :containsTrack ?track . }
}

If this query returns no results, it confirms that every record (album) has at least one track, thus modeling the competency question.
