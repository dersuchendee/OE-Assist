**No**  
Because the ontology does not explicitly assert (via a cardinality or existential restriction on Cl_Record) that every record must be connected to at least one track, we cannot fully answer the CQ “A record always contains at least one track” using the ontology. However, under a closed world assumption we can extract a partial answer – for example, identifying records that lack any track, which would indicate violations of that expectation.

A partial answer can be obtained with the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?record
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Record .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?record :containsTrack ?recordTrack . }
}
