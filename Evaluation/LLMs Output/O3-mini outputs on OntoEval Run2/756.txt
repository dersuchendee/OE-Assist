**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that—under the closed‐world assumption—extracts performance events together with their full geographic location (city, region and country):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?city ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate ;
               :performanceLocation ?city .
  ?city a :Cl_City ;
        :locatedInRegion ?region .
  ?region :locatedInCountry ?country .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves all performances along with their performance date and associated location details (city, region, and country), which answers the competency question modeled by the ontology and the story.
