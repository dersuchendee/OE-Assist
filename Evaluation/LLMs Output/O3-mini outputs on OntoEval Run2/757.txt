**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that verifies that every album (record) has at least one track (i.e. that each album has one or more :containsTrack relations):

──────────────────────────────
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album
HAVING (COUNT(?track) >= 1)
──────────────────────────────

In a closed world, if an album were missing any track, it would either not be asserted as a member of :Cl_Album (or would not meet the modeling constraint). Thus, the ontology “models” the CQ that a record always contains at least one track.
