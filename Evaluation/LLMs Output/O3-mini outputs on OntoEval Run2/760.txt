**Yes**

We can verify that every record (i.e. every instance of :Cl_Album) has at least one associated track (i.e. a triple using the :containsTrack property). For instance, using the closed‐world assumption we can run a query that looks for any album that lacks a track. An empty result confirms that every album does have at least one track. One SPARQL query to check this is:

--------------------------------------------------
ASK {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?album :containsTrack ?track .
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, if you want to list all albums with a count of their tracks (and then manually check that the count is ≥ 1 for every album), you can use:

--------------------------------------------------
SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album :containsTrack ?track . }
}
GROUP BY ?album
--------------------------------------------------

If the ASK query returns true (or if every album in the SELECT query has numTracks > 0), then the competency question “A record always contains at least one track” is indeed supported by the ontology.
