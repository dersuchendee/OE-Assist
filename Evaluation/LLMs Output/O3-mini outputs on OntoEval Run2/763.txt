**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that tests the competency question “A record always contains at least one track.” Under a closed‐world assumption, if any album (record) is missing a track (i.e. does not have at least one :containsTrack triple), it will be returned by the query:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?album :containsTrack ?track . }
}
------------------------------------------------

If the query returns no results then every album indeed has at least one track, which confirms that the ontology answers the competency question.
