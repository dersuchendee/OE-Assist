**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given person, all the medical degrees they hold (including any nursing degree, which by the ontology is a subclass of MedicalDegree):

  PREFIX : <http://example.org/medical_degrees#>  
  PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

  SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeLabel  
  WHERE {  
    ?person a :Person .  
    ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .  
    OPTIONAL { ?degree rdfs:label ?degreeLabel . }  
  }

Under a closed‐world assumption, this query will return the explicit medical degrees assigned to the person in question.
