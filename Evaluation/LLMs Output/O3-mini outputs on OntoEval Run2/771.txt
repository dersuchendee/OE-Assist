**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given person, all degrees that are instances of MedicalDegree, along with their names and dates:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?degree ?degreeName ?degreeDate
WHERE {
  # Replace <PersonURI> with the URI of the person in question 
  <PersonURI> a :Person ;
              :hasDegree ?degree .
  ?degree a :MedicalDegree .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeName ?degreeName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeDate ?degreeDate . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query assumes that the ontology models medical degrees as instances of the class MedicalDegree obtained via the property hasDegree from a Person. The closed world assumption means if no such degree is asserted for the given person, it wonâ€™t appear in the results.
