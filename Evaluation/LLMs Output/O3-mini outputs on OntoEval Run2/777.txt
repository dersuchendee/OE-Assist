**Yes**

We can answer this CQ by querying the ontology for a person’s associated medical degrees. For example, given that the ontology explicitly represents a person (e.g., :PasqualeDiGennaro) with the property :hasMedicalDegree (whose range is :Cl_MedicalDegree), we can write a SPARQL query (with a closed-world assumption) to return the titles (and optionally the obtained dates) of the medical degrees of a given person. For instance:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeTitle ?degreeObtainedDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree a :Cl_MedicalDegree .
  ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeObtainedDate ?degreeObtainedDate . }
  FILTER(?person = :PasqualeDiGennaro)
}

This query demonstrates that the CQ “What medical degrees does a certain person have?” is supported by the ontology.
