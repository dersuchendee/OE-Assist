Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, extracts the date(s) on which a given theatre festival took place by following the reified occurrence from a :Cl_TheatreFestival to its associated :Cl_FestivalOccurrence and retrieving the occurrence date via :occurredOnDate.

(Note: Replace <FESTIVAL_URI> with the specific URI for the theatre festival instance you wish to query.)
