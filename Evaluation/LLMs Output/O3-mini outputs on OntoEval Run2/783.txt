**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that uses the reification class (Cl_PersonDegreeStudy) to retrieve the medical degrees a person has:
 
--------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
 
SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeName
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_PersonDegreeStudy .
  ?record :personHasStudy ?person .
  ?record :studyInvolvesDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeName ?degreeName .
}
--------------------------------------------------------------
 
This query assumes the ontology models the connection between a person and their medical degrees via the reification class Cl_PersonDegreeStudy. Under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, only those degrees explicitly recorded in the ontology are returned.
