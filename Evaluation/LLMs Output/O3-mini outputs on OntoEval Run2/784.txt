**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query using the reified relation (the class :Cl_PersonDegreeStudy) that links a person to a medical degree (via the property :hasMedicalDegree), together with optional study‐period dates:

SELECT ?person ?medicalDegree ?studyStart ?studyEnd
WHERE {
  # Get the person and their medical degree via the direct property.
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :hasMedicalDegree ?medicalDegree .
  # (If you wish to restrict to a certain individual, e.g., Pasquale Di Gennaro, uncomment the following FILTER:)
  # FILTER(?person = :PasqualeDiGennaro) .

  # Optionally, retrieve the associated study period from the reification class.
  OPTIONAL {
    ?reification a :Cl_PersonDegreeStudy .
    # Because :Cl_PersonDegreeStudy is defined as subclass of both :Cl_Person and :Cl_MedicalDegree,
    # the same individual appearing as a reified relation connects the person and the degree.
    FILTER(?reification = ?person)
    ?reification :hasStudyPeriod ?period .
    ?period :studyStartDate ?studyStart ;
            :studyEndDate ?studyEnd .
  }
}
ORDER BY ?person ?studyStart

Explanation:
• The triple pattern ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?medicalDegree ensures that the CQ (“What medical degrees does a certain person have?”) is answerable.
• The OPTIONAL block uses the reification class (:Cl_PersonDegreeStudy) to gather additional study period details (start/end dates) if available.
• Under a closed‐world assumption no “hidden” facts exist; hence the answer is complete insofar as the ontology explicitly encodes the relevant relationships.

This query shows that the CQ is fully modelled by the ontology.
