**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology is populated with the relevant individuals (e.g. a person such as Pasquale Di Gennaro, and his associated medical degree(s)), we can answer the CQ “What medical degrees does a certain person have?” by checking either the direct property :hasMedicalDegree (if available) or the reified link via the study‐period class (i.e. :Cl_StudyForDegree) that connects a person to a medical degree. Under a closed‐world assumption, we require that if a medical degree relation is not stated then it does not hold.

Below is a SPARQL query that, given a person, retrieves his/her medical degree information. (You can add a FILTER on the person IRI if you want to restrict it to a “certain person.”)

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?degree ?degreeLabel ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  
  {
    # Direct relation: person has an explicitly stated medical degree
    ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
    OPTIONAL { ?degree rdfs:label ?degreeLabel . }
  }
  UNION
  {
    # Reified relation: the study period instance links a person and a degree
    ?study a :Cl_StudyForDegree ;
           :hasStudent ?person ;
           :hasDegree ?degree ;
           :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate ;
           :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
    OPTIONAL { ?degree rdfs:label ?degreeLabel . }
  }
}
ORDER BY ?person ?degree
------------------------------------------------------------

This query first finds all individuals of type :Cl_Person. Then, it uses a UNION to cover two cases:
1. The person directly has the property :hasMedicalDegree linking to a degree.
2. The person is related indirectly by a :Cl_StudyForDegree instance (i.e. reification) where the properties :hasStudent (linking to the person), :hasDegree (linking to the degree) and optionally the study start/end dates are filled.

Thus, the competency question is fully modelled by the ontology.
