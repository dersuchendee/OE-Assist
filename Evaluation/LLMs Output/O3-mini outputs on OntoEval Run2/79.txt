**Yes**

Assuming we have an individual representing the target festival (e.g. with the name "Roma Loves Shakespeare"), we can write a SPARQL query that retrieves its associated time period (start and end dates) via the property :takesPlaceDuring used in the ontology. Under the closed‚Äêworld assumption only explicit information is returned, so if the festival individual has explicit date properties then the query will return an answer.

Below is an example query:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?name ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasName ?name .
  FILTER(?name = "Roma Loves Shakespeare") .
  ?festival :takesPlaceDuring ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :hasStartDate ?startDate .
  ?timePeriod :hasEndDate ?endDate .
}

This query extracts the festival (by filtering for its name), then finds its associated time period by following the :takesPlaceDuring relation and retrieving the start and end dates defined via the :hasStartDate and :hasEndDate data properties.
