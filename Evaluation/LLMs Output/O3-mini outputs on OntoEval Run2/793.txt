**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that extracts the study period for a given person and degree by linking the personâ€™s participation in a study event (for which the degree is the studied degree) with the time period of that event:

PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?degree a :Cl_Degree .

  # Retrieve the study event that connects the person and the degree
  ?person :participatedInStudyEvent ?studyEvent .
  ?degree :isDegreeOfStudyEvent ?studyEvent .

  # Retrieve the time period associated with that study event
  ?timePeriod a :Cl_TimePeriod ;
              :isPeriodOfStudyEvent ?studyEvent ;
              :hasStartDate ?startDate ;
              :hasEndDate ?endDate .
}
-------------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, only explicitly asserted individuals (and property assertions) will be returned. This query shows that the ontology explicitly supports the CQ "During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?"
