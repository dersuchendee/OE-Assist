**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves instances of festivals (represented in the ontology as Cl_FestivalEvent, a subclass of Cl_TheatreFestival) along with their names and their start/end dates. Under the closed‐world assumption we assume that any missing start or end date means that the information is not available.

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_FestivalEvent .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :festivalName ?festivalName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :startDate  ?startDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?festival :endDate    ?endDate . }
  # To restrict results to a specific festival, you might use a FILTER:
  # FILTER(STR(?festivalName)="Roma Loves Shakespeare")
}

This query answers the competency question “When did a certain theatre festival take place?” by extracting the temporal data (startDate and endDate) associated with the festival event using the reified class in the ontology.
