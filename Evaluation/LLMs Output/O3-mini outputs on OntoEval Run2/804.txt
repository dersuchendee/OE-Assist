Below is one possible SPARQL query that returns, for a given person and degree, the study period (i.e. the start and end dates) during which the person studied for that degree:

──────────────────────────────
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :hasMedicalDegree ?personDegree .
  ?personDegree :degreeOf ?degree ;
                :studiedDuring ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :startDate ?startDate ;
               :endDate ?endDate .
  
  # You can replace these values with the desired person and degree.
  FILTER(?person = :Pasquale_Di_Gennaro && ?degree = :NursingAssistantDegree)
}
──────────────────────────────

This query answers the competency question “During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?” using the ontology elements (specifically the :studiedDuring property and the associated :Cl_StudyPeriod class, which provides a :startDate and :endDate) under the closed world assumption.
