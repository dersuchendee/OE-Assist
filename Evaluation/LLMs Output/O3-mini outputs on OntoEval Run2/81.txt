**No**

The ontology allows us to retrieve the dates associated with instances of :Cl_TheatreFestival (via the property :hasDate). However, because it lacks any property that uniquely identifies or names "a certain" festival (e.g. a title or label linking the OS’s “Roma Loves Shakespeare” to an instance of :Cl_TheatreFestival), we can only extract a partial answer by listing all theatre festival instances together with their dates.

For example, a partial SPARQL query would be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?date 
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasDate ?date .
}

This query returns the dates when theatre festival events took place, but does not allow us to uniquely select “a certain” festival due to a lack of identifying properties in the ontology.
