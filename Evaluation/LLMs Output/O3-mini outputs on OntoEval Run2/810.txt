**Yes**

Assuming that the “specific person” and “specific degree” are identified (for example, via their URI or by filtering on a data property such as “degreeTitle”), you can retrieve the study period by leveraging the reified class Cl_PersonDegree (which carries the properties studyStartDate and studyEndDate). Here is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption (i.e. only considering explicitly asserted facts), retrieves the study period for a specific person and degree:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degreeTitle ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasDegree ?personDegree .
  ?personDegree :degreeType ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle .
  ?personDegree :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate .
  ?personDegree :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .

  # Adjust the filters below for the specific person and degree of interest:
  FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro>)
  FILTER(str(?degreeTitle) = "Certified Nurse")
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query the assumption is that:
– The individual representing the specific person (here, Pasquale Di Gennaro) is identified by a URI.
– The degree’s title (e.g. "Certified Nurse") is used to filter the reified degree event.
– The studyStartDate and studyEndDate properties are attached to the reification instance (?personDegree).

This query fully answers the competency question by extracting the time period during which the person studied for that degree.
