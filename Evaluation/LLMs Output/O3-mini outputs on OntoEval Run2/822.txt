**Yes**

We can answer the CQ "When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?" because the ontology encodes employment information for persons, including their employment start dates and the hospitals at which they work. Under the closed world assumption, if a person has an employment record, then that record is the complete employment history. For example, Pasquale Di Gennaro has an employment record with an employment start date, which is directly accessible via the properties defined in the ontology.

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each person and hospital they have been employed at, the earliest (minimum) employment start date:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?employmentStartDate) AS ?firstEmployedDate)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
------------------------------------------------

This query ensures that the competency question is fully answerable with the provided ontology.
