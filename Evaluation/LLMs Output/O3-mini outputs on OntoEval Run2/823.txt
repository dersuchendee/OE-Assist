**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the earliest employment start date for a given person at a given hospital:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?employmentStartDate) AS ?firstEmployed)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate ;
              :employmentInHospital ?hospital .
  FILTER(?person = :PasqualeDiGennaro && ?hospital = :OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli)
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
ORDER BY ?firstEmployed
-------------------------------------------------

This query shows how the ontology models the CQ "When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?" by extracting the minimum (i.e. first) employment start date for Pasquale Di Gennaro at Ospedale Riunito delle Tre Valli.
