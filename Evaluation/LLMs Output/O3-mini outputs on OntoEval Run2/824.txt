**Yes**

We can answer this CQ by retrieving the employment start date for a given person at a specific hospital. For example, assuming we are looking for Pasquale Di Gennaro’s first employment at Ospedale Riunito delle Tre Valli, the following SPARQL query obtains his earliest employment start date:

——————————————————————————————

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?employmentStartDate) AS ?firstEmployment)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital ;
              :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  FILTER(?person = :PasqualeDiGennaro && ?hospital = :OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli)
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital

——————————————————————————————

This query uses the ontology’s properties (:hasEmployment, :employedAt, :employmentStartDate) to extract the first employment date for the person at the given hospital, under a closed‐world assumption.
