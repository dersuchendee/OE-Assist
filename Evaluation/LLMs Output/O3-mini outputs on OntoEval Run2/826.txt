**Yes**

The ontology supports this competency question. We can extract the employment start dates by querying for instances of employment that link a person and a hospital with an employment start date. For example, one SPARQL query under the closed‚Äêworld assumption is:

---------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?startDate) AS ?firstEmployment)
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment ;
              :employee ?person ;
              :employedAt ?hospital ;
              :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
---------------------------------------

This query returns for each person and hospital the earliest (first) employment start date.
