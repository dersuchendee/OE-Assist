Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the earliest employment date for a given person at a given hospital. Under the closed‐world assumption we assume that all employment events are recorded in the ontology. (In this example the individual is Pasquale_Di_Gennaro and the hospital is Ospedale_Riunito_delle_Tre_Valli.)

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?employmentDate) AS ?firstEmployed)
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment ;
              :employee ?person ;
              :employedAt ?hospital ;
              :employmentDate ?employmentDate .
  
  FILTER(?person = :Pasquale_Di_Gennaro && ?hospital = :Ospedale_Riunito_delle_Tre_Valli)
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital

This query answers the competency question “When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?” by extracting the minimum employment date for that person at that hospital.
