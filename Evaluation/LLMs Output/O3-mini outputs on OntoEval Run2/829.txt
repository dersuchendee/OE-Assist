Assuming that the ontology is modelled with a reification class (Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment) that connects a person, a hospital, and an employment instance (with an employment date associated via the employmentStartedOn property), the competency question “When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?” can be answered under a closed‐world assumption. In other words, we can extract the employment dates for the person–hospital association and return the earliest (MIN) date.

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each person and hospital, the minimum employment date:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?employmentDate) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_PersonHospitalEmployment .
  ?employment :personEmployedAtHospital ?person .
  ?employment :hospitalHasEmployee ?hospital .
  ?employment :employmentStartedOn ?employmentDate .
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
ORDER BY ?person ?firstEmploymentDate
------------------------------------------------

This query fully answers the CQ by returning for each person–hospital pair the earliest recorded employment date.
