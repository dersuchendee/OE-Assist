**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given person and hospital, the earliest employment start date recorded in the ontology via the employment reification class:

----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?startDate) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment .
  ?employment :hasEmployee ?person .
  ?employment :employedAt ?hospital .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
  # Replace the following URIs with the specific person and hospital you are interested in:
  FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro> &&
         ?hospital = <http://www.example.org/test#OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli>)
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
ORDER BY ?firstEmploymentDate
----------------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports answering the CQ “When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?” under a closed world assumption.
