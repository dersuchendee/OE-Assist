**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves each hospital’s city by following the defined object property:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :op_isLocatedIn ?city .
  ?city :dp_cityName ?cityName .
}

This query works under a closed world assumption by only returning cities that are explicitly linked to hospitals via :op_isLocatedIn, thus modelling the CQ “In what city is a certain hospital located?” correctly.
