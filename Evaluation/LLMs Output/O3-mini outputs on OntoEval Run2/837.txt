**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves hospitals (or a specific hospital) along with the city where they are located:

PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital a ns1:Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
  
  ?hospital ns1:locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}
  
This query supports the competency question “In what city is a certain hospital located?” based on the ontology.
