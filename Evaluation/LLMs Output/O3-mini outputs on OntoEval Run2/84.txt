**Yes**

The ontology supports this CQ. We can extract the occurrence date(s) of a theatre festival (e.g., “Roma Loves Shakespeare”) via the connection between a festival and its festival occurrences that have a date. For example, using the individual :RomaLovesShakespeare, one can retrieve the date of the occurrence with the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?occurrence ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_Festival ;
            :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :hasDate ?date .
  FILTER(?festival = :RomaLovesShakespeare)
}

This query retrieves the festival, its occurrence, and the date it took place.
