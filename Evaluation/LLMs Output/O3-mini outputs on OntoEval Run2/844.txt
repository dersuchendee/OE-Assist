**Yes**

We can answer the CQ “In what city is a certain hospital located?” using the ontology. The ontology defines a class for hospitals (:Cl_Hospital), a class for cities (:Cl_City), and the object property (:locatedIn) that connects a hospital to a city. Under a closed‐world assumption, we can assume that if a hospital is not explicitly linked to a city, it is not located in any city.

A suitable SPARQL query would be:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel. }
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel. }
}
---------------------------------

This query retrieves all hospitals together with their corresponding cities.
