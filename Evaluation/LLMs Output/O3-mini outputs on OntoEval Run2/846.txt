**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query to extract the city for a given hospital (e.g., OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?city
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
  FILTER(?hospital = :OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli)
}

This query demonstrates that the ontology indeed supports the competency question "In what city is a certain hospital located?" under a closed-world assumption.
