Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption with the provided ontology, retrieves for each city the country in which it is located:

--------------------------------------------------

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :op_isLocatedIn ?country .
}

--------------------------------------------------

This query directly answers the competency question “In what country is a certain city located?” by finding all individuals that are cities and retrieving their associated country via the object property :op_isLocatedIn.
