**Yes**

Assuming that each theatre festival is linked (by naming convention or an implicit association) to a reified occurrence that records its date, we can answer the CQ with a query like this:

----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?occurrence a :Cl_FestivalOccurrence ;
              :hasDate ?date .
  # Assuming a naming convention (or an implicit link) where the occurrence URI contains the festival URI,
  # we join a festival with its occurrence.
  FILTER(CONTAINS(STR(?occurrence), STR(?festival)))
}
----------------------------------------------------

Under the closed‐world assumption, we assume that if an occurrence is not linked by such a naming pattern, then it does not exist. This query extracts the date(s) when a given theatre festival (e.g. “RomaLovesShakespeare”) took place.
