**Yes**

The following SPARQL query can be used under the closed‐world assumption to answer the competency question “In what country is a certain city located?” by retrieving the country associated with any city in the ontology:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?country .
} 

This query retrieves each city and the country it is located in, thereby fully supporting the competency question.
