**Yes**

We can answer the CQ using the ontology because it explicitly defines cities with the class Cl_City that are related to countries (Cl_Country) via the property locatedIn. Under a closed world assumption we assume the ontology contains all the needed assertions. Here is a SPARQL query to extract, for a given city, the country in which it is located:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :cityName ?cityName . }
  ?city :locatedIn ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?country :countryName ?countryName . }
}

This query finds a city (of type Cl_City) and retrieves the corresponding country via the locatedIn property along with optional labels for both.
