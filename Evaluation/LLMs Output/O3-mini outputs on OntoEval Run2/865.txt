We can extract the country of a given city using the links defined in the ontology. In this ontology a city (instance of :Cl_City) is associated via the property :locatedInCountry with a country location object, which in turn is linked to the actual country (instance of :Cl_Country) by the property :inCountry. Here is one SPARQL query that retrieves the country for each city:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel. }
  
  ?city :locatedInCountry ?countryLoc .
  ?countryLoc :inCountry ?country .
  OPTIONAL { ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?city

This query answers the competency question “In what country is a certain city located?” using the modelling provided in the ontology under a closed‐world assumption.
