**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves for each city the country in which it is located:

-------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?country .
}
-------------------------------------------------------

This query directly answers the CQ "In what country is a certain city located?" by extracting the connection between instances of :Cl_City and their associated :Cl_Country via the property :locatedIn.
