**Yes**

Assuming a closed world where the provided triples completely specify the countries for the cities, the CQ “In what country is a certain city located?” can be answered by querying for instances of Cl_City that have a :cityInCountry relationship to a Cl_Country. For example:

-----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?country 
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityInCountry ?country .
}
-----------------------------------

This query will return the country for every city (e.g., :NoceraInferiore associated with :Italy), thus fully answering the competency question.
