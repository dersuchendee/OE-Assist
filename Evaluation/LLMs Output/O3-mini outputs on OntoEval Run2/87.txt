**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that extracts the date associated with a given theatre festival (here exemplified with “Festival_RomaLovesShakespeare”):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasFestivalOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :festivalDate ?date .
  # Optionally filter by label (if the festival has a specific label property)
  # ?festival rdfs:label ?label .
  # FILTER regex(?label, "Roma Loves Shakespeare", "i")
}
ORDER BY ?date

This query answerably retrieves when a theatre festival (i.e. its festival occurrence date) took place, demonstrating that the CQ “When did a certain theatre festival take place?” is modelled in the ontology.
