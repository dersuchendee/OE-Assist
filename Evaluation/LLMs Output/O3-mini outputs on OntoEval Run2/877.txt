**Yes**

We can answer the CQ because the ontology explicitly models cities, countries, and the relationship between them (using the property :isLocatedInCountry with a :Cl_City as domain and :Cl_Country as range). Under a closed world assumption, if the data provides the specific city instance (for example, Nocera Inferiore), we can extract the country in which that city is located.

For example, if we assume the city has an rdfs:label "Nocera Inferiore", the SPARQL query would be:

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City ;
        rdfs:label "Nocera Inferiore" ;
        :isLocatedInCountry ?country .
}
----------------------------------

This query extracts the city and its associated country, thereby answering the competency question.
