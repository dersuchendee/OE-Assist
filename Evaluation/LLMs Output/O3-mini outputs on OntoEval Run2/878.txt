**Yes**

Assuming the ontology instances include cities and their countries, you could answer the CQ by selecting all cities and their related country via the object property “:isLocatedIn”. Under the closed‐world assumption, any city without an asserted country would be treated as not located in any country. For example, you could write the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
}

This query retrieves each city (an instance of :Cl_City) together with the country in which it is located, thereby fully supporting the competency question "In what country is a certain city located?"
