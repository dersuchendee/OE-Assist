**Yes**

Assuming we interpret “a certain union” and “a certain point in time” as parameters, the ontology supports this CQ via the reified union membership information (the class Cl_UnionMembership linking a staff member, a union via the :hasUnion property, and the membership start date via :hasStartDate). For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves the members of a specified union (here provided as the IRI for that union) whose membership had started on or before a given point in time.

Replace <UNION_IRI> with the IRI of the union and "YYYY-MM-DD" with the desired date.

SELECT ?member ?memberLabel ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :hasUnion <UNION_IRI> ;
              :hasMember ?member ;
              :hasStartDate ?startDate .
  FILTER (?startDate <= "YYYY-MM-DD"^^xsd:date)
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption (i.e. only the explicitly stated memberships are considered valid), this query will correctly extract the answer to the CQ: “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?”
