**No**

The union membership information is only partially modelled. The ontology provides a way to link an employee to a union via the property “representsUnion” (and a union representative’s starting date via “unionRepresentativeSince”), and also models union memberships as a collection (class UnionMembership) but does not connect a specific union instance to its membership collection. Thus, while we can extract the union‐representative employees (a subset of union members) at a given point in time, we cannot fully answer “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” for all members.

A partial SPARQL query that retrieves union representatives valid on a given date (here, “2002-01-01”) is given below:

PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?employee ?employeeLabel ?union ?unionLabel ?unionRepSince
WHERE {
  ?employee a :Employee .
  ?employee :representsUnion ?union .
  ?employee :unionRepresentativeSince ?unionRepSince .
  # Closed World Assumption: if an employee does not have unionRepresentativeSince, they are not included.
  FILTER(xsd:date("2002-01-01") >= ?unionRepSince) .
  OPTIONAL { ?employee rdfs:label ?employeeLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?union rdfs:label ?unionLabel . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query returns a partial answer by listing employees who represent a union and whose union representative start date is on or before the given date.
