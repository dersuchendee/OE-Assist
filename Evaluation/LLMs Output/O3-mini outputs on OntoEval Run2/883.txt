**Yes**  
Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a target union (e.g. ns1:MaleNurseUnion) and a target date (e.g. "2002-06-15T00:00:00Z"), returns the persons (union members) whose union membership period covers that date.

Note: The query assumes that membership periods are modelled as time:Intervals with properties time:hasBeginning and optionally time:hasEnd. Under the closed world assumption, only the explicitly provided membership intervals (and their unions) are considered.

  # Define the target date at which we want to check the membership
  BIND(xsd:dateTime("2002-06-15T00:00:00Z") AS ?targetDate) .

  # The target date must be after or equal to the start and (if exists) before or equal to the end date.
  FILTER ( ?targetDate >= ?start && ( !bound(?end) || ?targetDate <= ?end ) ) .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
}

This query answers the CQ “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” by using the reified membership information (ns1:UnionMembership with its membership period) available in the ontology.
