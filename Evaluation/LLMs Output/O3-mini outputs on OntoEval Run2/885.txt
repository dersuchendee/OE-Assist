**Yes**
Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves the employees (i.e. union members) who belong to a specified union at a given point in time. (Replace the placeholders :SpecificUnion and the date literal with the actual union and time you are interested in.)

SELECT DISTINCT ?employee ?employeeLabel ?union ?timeValue
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :hasUnion ?union ;
              :hasTimePoint ?timePoint ;
              :hasEmployee ?employee .
  
  ?timePoint :timeValue ?timeValue .
  OPTIONAL { ?employee rdfs:label ?employeeLabel . }
  
  # Filter to a specific union and a specific time point
  FILTER (?union = :SpecificUnion && ?timeValue = "2002-01-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}

This query confirms that the ontology provides the necessary classes and relations (using reification in :Cl_UnionMembership) to answer the competency question "Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?" under the closed world assumption.
