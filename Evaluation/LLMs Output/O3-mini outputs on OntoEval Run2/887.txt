**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, extracts the persons who have a union membership record (modeled via the reified class Cl_UnionMembership) for a given union (here assumed to be an individual of Cl_UnionGroup) and whose membership time period (using the data properties :startTime and :endTime on the time period individual linked via the property :unionMembershipDuring) contains a given point in time.

In this query you must replace the placeholder URI for the “certain union” and the time literal for the “certain point in time” with the appropriate values.

This query is answerable using the ontology because every component in the CQ—person, union membership (as a reified fact with its time interval), and union group—is linked through explicit properties, allowing us to retrieve the members of a specified union at a given point in time.
