**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that uses the ontology’s union membership reification to select persons (of type Cl_Person) that have a union membership (an instance of Cl_UnionMembership ⎯ linked by the property memberOf from Cl_Person) whose associated union (retrieved via the same property, according to the restriction on Cl_UnionMembership) matches a given union IRI and that became effective (as indicated by the membershipDate) before or at the given point in time.

For example, assuming the specific union is identified by the IRI <http://www.example.org/test#UnionX> and the “point in time” is “2005-01-01T00:00:00” (an arbitrary example value), you could run a query like this:

-------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personLabel ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  
  # The person has a union membership (a reified membership instance)
  ?person :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership .
  
  # According to the restriction, the membership instance must point to a union:
  ?membership :memberOf ?union .
  FILTER (?union = <http://www.example.org/test#UnionX>)
  
  # The membership has a membershipDate – we assume membership becomes effective at that date.
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
  
  # The union membership is effective if the joining date is at or before the given point in time.
  FILTER (xsd:dateTime("2005-01-01T00:00:00") >= ?membershipDate)
}
ORDER BY ?person
-------------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” by retrieving those persons for whom a union membership with the specified union exists and whose membership date is prior to or equal to the given moment.
