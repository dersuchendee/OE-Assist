**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that uses a given union URI and a target date to retrieve the persons who were members of that union at that time. In this query, we assume that a membership is valid at a given time if the membershipStartDate is on or before the given date and, if a membershipEndDate exists, the given date is also on or before the membershipEndDate. (Under a closed‐world assumption, if membershipEndDate is not provided, the membership is assumed to be still active.)

This query answers the CQ “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” using the ontology’s union membership classes and properties.
