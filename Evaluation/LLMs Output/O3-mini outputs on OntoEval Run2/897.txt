**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a specific union (for example, MaleNursesUnion) and a specific point in time, retrieves the persons who are members of that union at that time. (Under a closed‚Äêworld assumption any missing end date is taken to mean that the membership is still active):

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :membershipOf ?person ;
              :memberOf ?union ;
              :membershipStartDate ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEnd . }
  
  # Filter for the given union and the membership validity at a given date.
  # Replace <http://www.example.org/test#MaleNursesUnion> with the union of interest,
  # and "2003-01-01"^^xsd:date with the point-in-time under investigation.
  FILTER(
    ?union = <http://www.example.org/test#MaleNursesUnion> &&
    "2003-01-01"^^xsd:date >= ?membershipStart &&
    ( !bound(?membershipEnd) || "2003-01-01"^^xsd:date <= ?membershipEnd )
  )
}
ORDER BY ?membershipStart
