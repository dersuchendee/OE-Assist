**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query. In this example we assume that a reified union membership (of type :Cl_UnionMembership) records for each membership the union organization via the property :memberOf, the person via :hasMember, and the membership period via the data properties :membershipStartDate and (optionally) :membershipEndDate. In the query we filter those memberships where the given reference date (e.g. "2002-06-01") falls within the membership period.

SELECT ?member ?memberLabel
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :memberOf :YourUnion ;       # replace with the specific union URI
              :hasMember ?member ;
              :membershipStartDate ?start .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?end . }
  
  # Filter to include only memberships valid at the reference date (here "2002-06-01")
  FILTER(
    ?start <= "2002-06-01"^^xsd:date &&
    ( !bound(?end) || ?end >= "2002-06-01"^^xsd:date )
  )
  
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?member

You can replace :YourUnion with the URI for the union of interest and adjust the reference date ("2002-06-01"^^xsd:date) as needed.
