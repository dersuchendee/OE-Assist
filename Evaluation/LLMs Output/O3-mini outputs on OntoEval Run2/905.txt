**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, returns for a given person the union group and the union role they hold at a specified point in time. In this query we assume that the reified membership is captured by the class Cl_UnionRoleMembership, which links a person, a union group (via property roleMembershipIn), and a union role (via property roleOfMembership) with its start and (optionally) an end date.

For example, to check the role of a person at the date "2002-06-01", you can use:

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?unionGroup ?role ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionRoleMembership ;
              :roleMembershipIn ?unionGroup ;
              :roleOfMembership ?role ;
              :roleStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :roleEndDate ?endDate . }
  ?person :hasRoleMembership ?membership .

  # Filter membership to those valid at the given date (e.g., "2002-06-01")
  FILTER (
      "2002-06-01"^^xsd:date >= ?startDate &&
      ( !bound(?endDate) || "2002-06-01"^^xsd:date <= ?endDate )
  )
}
ORDER BY ?person ?unionGroup
--------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology reifies the union role membership—connecting a Cl_Person, a Cl_UnionGroup, and a Cl_UnionRole with a time interval—so the competency question is fully modelled.
