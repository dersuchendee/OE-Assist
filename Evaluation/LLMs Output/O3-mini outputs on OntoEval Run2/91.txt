**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves each theatre festival’s occurrence along with its date (i.e. “when” it took place):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?occurrenceDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :occurrenceDate ?occurrenceDate .
}

This query assumes that each festival instance is linked via the reification property :hasOccurrence to an occurrence entity that carries its :occurrenceDate.
