**Yes**

Below is one way to answer the CQ over the ontology. In this query we assume that a person’s current union involvement is modelled by a union membership (via :memberOf and its linked :union) and the person’s role in the union is given by a reified role instance (via :hasRole having properties :role, :roleStartDate, and :roleEndDate). We then filter by a given person, a specified union, and a given time (ensuring that the time falls between the start and end dates of the role).

For example, to ask “What union role does Pasquale Di Gennaro have in the MaleNursesUnion on 2005‑01‑01?” the query could be written as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?roleStartDate ?roleEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :union ?union .

  ?person :hasRole ?unionRole .
  ?unionRole :role ?role .
  ?unionRole :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate .
  ?unionRole :roleEndDate ?roleEndDate .

  # Using parameter placeholders for the specific person and union
  FILTER (?person = <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro>)
  FILTER (?union = <http://www.example.org/test#MaleNursesUnion>)

  # Check that the given time (e.g., "2005-01-01") falls within the role period
  FILTER (
    xsd:date("2005-01-01") >= ?roleStartDate &&
    xsd:date("2005-01-01") <= ?roleEndDate
  )
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the union role held by the person at the specified point in time, fully addressing the competency question.
