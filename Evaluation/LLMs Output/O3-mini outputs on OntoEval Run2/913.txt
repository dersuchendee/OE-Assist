**Yes**

One possible SPARQL query to retrieve the union role (with its date) for a given person within a given union at a specified point in time (using appropriate filters) is as follows:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?union ?unionLabel ?role ?roleDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
  ?role a :Cl_UnionRole .
  ?role :roleDate ?roleDate .
  ?role :hasRole ?union .
  OPTIONAL { ?union rdfs:label ?unionLabel . }
  
  # Filter for the specific person (replace with the actual URI)
  FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro>)
  
  # Filter for the specific union group (replace with the actual union URI)
  FILTER(?union = <http://www.example.org/test#MaleNursesUnion>)
  
  # Filter to check that the role is in effect at a given point in time.
  # For example, if you wish to retrieve roles valid on 2003-01-01,
  # you could apply a condition on ?roleDate. Adjust the condition as needed.
  FILTER(?roleDate <= "2003-01-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
ORDER BY ?roleDate

In this query we assume:
 • The person of interest (e.g. Pasquale Di Gennaro) and the union group (e.g. representing male nurses) have explicit URIs in the ontology.
 • The property :hasRole is used in two ways: to link a person to an instance of :Cl_UnionRole and to link the :Cl_UnionRole instance to the related union group (as required by the restriction).
 • The query filters by a given date to ensure that the role applies at that point in time.

Under the closed world assumption the ontology provides enough structure (via the role reification) to answer the competency question.
