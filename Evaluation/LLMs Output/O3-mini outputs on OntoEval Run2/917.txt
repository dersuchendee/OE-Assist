**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that returns the union role held by a given person in a given union, and checks that the role is effective at a supplied point in time. In a closed‐world approach the query assumes that every role must have a start date and—in case it has ended—a defined end date. (Here the example uses Pasquale Di Gennaro, the union “Union for Male Nurses”, and a test date of “2003-01-01” to check the role.)

SELECT ?roleName ?roleStartDate ?roleEndDate
WHERE {
  ?unionRole a :Cl_UnionRole ;
             :roleHolder :Pasquale_Di_Gennaro ;
             :hasUnionRole :Union_Male_Nurses ;
             :roleName ?roleName ;
             :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?unionRole :roleEndDate ?roleEndDate }

  # Check that the provided time (for example, 2003-01-01) falls between roleStartDate and roleEndDate (if defined)
  FILTER (
      "2003-01-01"^^xsd:date >= ?roleStartDate &&
      ( !bound(?roleEndDate) || "2003-01-01"^^xsd:date <= ?roleEndDate )
  )
}
ORDER BY ?roleStartDate
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question: “What role does a certain person have within a certain union group at a certain point in time?”
