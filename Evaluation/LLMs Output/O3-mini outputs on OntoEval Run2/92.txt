**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves theatre festivals along with the date(s) on which they occurred:

----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?occurrenceDate
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :occurrenceDate ?occurrenceDate .
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?occurrenceDate
----------------------------------------------------

This query extracts each theatre festival (of type Cl_TheatreFestival) and its associated occurrence date from the reified occurrence class (Cl_FestivalOccurrence) via the property :occurrenceDate.
