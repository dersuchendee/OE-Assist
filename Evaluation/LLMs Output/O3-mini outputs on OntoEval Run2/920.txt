**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world interpretation, will retrieve for a given person (and a given union group and a given time point) the union role that that person holds. In this example the query uses a fixed test time (e.g. 2003‑01‑01), but in a real setting you could pass that as a parameter. Note that the query looks up a union membership (linking a person to a union via the property “:membershipOf” and “:memberOf”) and then “joins” that membership with its role (using “:hasRole”) while filtering on the valid role’s time interval (i.e. the role’s start and, if provided, end date).

  # For a given point in time (here “2003-01-01”) we check that:
  #   - that time is on or after the role start date and
  #   - if a roleEndDate is given then the time is on or before the role end.
  FILTER(
    xsd:date("2003-01-01") >= ?roleStartDate &&
    ( !bound(?roleEndDate) || xsd:date("2003-01-01") <= ?roleEndDate )
  )
}
ORDER BY ?person ?union

In this way the ontology supports the competency question “What role does a certain person have within a certain union group at a certain point in time?” because we can extract the answer by querying the reified relationship (union membership and its associated union role) along with the temporal constraints.
