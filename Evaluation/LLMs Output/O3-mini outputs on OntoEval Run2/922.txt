**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given person and union, the union role they held at a specified date using the reified union role information:

-------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?roleStartDate ?roleEndDate
WHERE {
  # The individual person must be of type Cl_Person.
  ?person a :Cl_Person .

  # Retrieve the reified union membership that also provides role details.
  ?membership a :Cl_PersonUnionRole ;
              :memberOf ?union ;     # the union group the person belongs to
              :hasRole ?role ;       # the role held
              :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate ;
              :roleEndDate ?roleEndDate .

  # Link the membership back to the person.
  # (Assuming the reified union role individual is connected with the person by being a member of both Cl_Person and Cl_Union.)
  # (If an explicit property connects the membership to the person, include it here. In our ontology the reification class Cl_PersonUnionRole is a subclass of Cl_Person,
  # so ?membership can be regarded as representing the person’s union membership and role.)
  FILTER (?membership = ?person)

  # Closed-world assumption: only consider the roles whose effective period covers the query date.
  BIND(xsd:date("2002-06-15") AS ?queryDate) .
  FILTER(?queryDate >= ?roleStartDate && ?queryDate <= ?roleEndDate)

  # (Optionally, to focus on a certain union group, you can further filter by union IRIs)
  # FILTER(?union = :MaleNursesUnion)
}
ORDER BY ?person ?union ?roleStartDate
-------------------------------------

In this query we assume that:
• The person (e.g. Pasquale Di Gennaro) is represented as an individual of type :Cl_Person.
• Their union membership with reified role is modelled as an instance of :Cl_PersonUnionRole that is also connected to a union (via :memberOf) and holds a role (via :hasRole) with associated effective dates (:roleStartDate and :roleEndDate).
• A given query date (here “2002-06-15”) is used to check the temporal validity of the role assignment.
• The closed-world assumption is applied by only retrieving those roles that are effective at the given point in time.

This query answers the competency question “What role does a certain person have within a certain union group at a certain point in time?” by returning the role details that meet the provided date condition.
