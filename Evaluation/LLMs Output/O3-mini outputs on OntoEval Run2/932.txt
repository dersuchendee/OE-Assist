**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the evaluation statement (its text and date) authored by a specific doctor for a specific employee:

--------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?evaluationStatement ?statementText ?statementDate
WHERE {
  ?evaluationStatement a :EvaluationStatement ;
                       :authoredBy ?doctor ;
                       :aboutEmployee ?employee ;
                       :statementText ?statementText ;
                       :statementDate ?statementDate .
  # Replace the following URIs with the actual identifiers for the doctor and employee:
  FILTER(?doctor = <http://example.org/ontology#Doctor1> && ?employee = <http://example.org/ontology#Employee1>)
}
--------------------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, we assume that only those evaluation statements explicitly represented in the ontology exist. This query answers the CQ “What is the evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee?” by retrieving exactly the evaluation statement(s) that match the given doctor and employee identifiers.
