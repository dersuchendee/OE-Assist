**Yes**

The ontology provides a modeling of evaluations through the Cl_Evaluation class and properties (evaluatedBy linking a Cl_Employee to a Cl_Evaluation, evaluator linking a Cl_Evaluation to a Cl_Doctor, and evaluationStatement holding the written evaluation). Under a closed world assumption, only those evaluations explicitly asserted in the data will be returned. Here is an appropriate SPARQL query to extract the evaluation statement given by a particular doctor for a particular employee:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?employee ?doctor ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  ?employee a :Cl_Employee .
  ?employee :evaluatedBy ?evaluation .
  ?evaluation :evaluator ?doctor .
  ?evaluation :evaluationStatement ?evaluationStatement .
  # Replace the URIs below with the specific doctor and employee as needed:
  FILTER(?employee = <http://www.example.org/test#Employee123> && 
         ?doctor   = <http://www.example.org/test#DoctorABC>)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that for a given employee and a given doctor, the ontology supports extracting the evaluation statement, thus confirming that the CQ is modelled by the ontology.
