**Yes**

Assuming that evaluation statements are modelled by the reified class Cl_EvaluationStatement—with employees having evaluations via the property :hasEvaluation and each evaluation linked to the doctor (its evaluator) via :evaluationByDoctor (and the text provided via :evaluationText)—we can answer this competency question. Under a closed‐world assumption only those employees with such evaluations (and where the evaluation was made by the specified doctor) will be returned.

For example, given parameters for a specific employee (e.g. :SomeEmployee) and a specific doctor (e.g. :SomeDoctor), you can extract the evaluation text with the following SPARQL query:

---------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?employee ?employeeLabel ?doctor ?doctorLabel ?evaluationText
WHERE {
  ?employee a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?employee rdfs:label ?employeeLabel . }
  
  ?employee :hasEvaluation ?evaluation .
  ?evaluation :evaluationByDoctor ?doctor .
  OPTIONAL { ?doctor rdfs:label ?doctorLabel . }
  
  ?evaluation :evaluationText ?evaluationText .
  
  # Replace :SomeEmployee and :SomeDoctor with the actual individuals you need 
  FILTER(?employee = :SomeEmployee && ?doctor = :SomeDoctor)
}
---------------------------------------------------------

This query returns the employee and doctor (with their optional labels) along with the evaluation statement text as stored in the ontology.
