**Yes**

Assuming that instances of theatre festivals are available in the ontology (i.e. individuals of type :Cl_TheatreFestival with an associated :hasDate property), the following SPARQL query will extract the date for a given festival. For example, if you are interested in the festival “Roma Loves Shakespeare” (assuming it is annotated via rdfs:label), you can run:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :hasDate ?date ;
            rdfs:label "Roma Loves Shakespeare" .
}

If you simply want to list the dates for all theatre festivals (and then select the one you need), you can use:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :hasDate ?date .
}
ORDER BY ?date

Under the closed-world assumption (only the explicitly asserted facts are true), this query fully answers the CQ.
