Below is an example SPARQL query that extracts the evaluation statement given by a doctor for an employee. Note that you can replace the URIs used in the FILTER clause with those referring to the specific doctor and employee of interest.

SELECT ?doctor ?employee ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  ?eval a :Cl_DoctorEmployeeEvaluation .
  ?eval :evaluationByDoctor ?doctor .
  ?eval :evaluationOfEmployee ?employee .
  ?eval :evaluationStatement ?evaluationStatement .
  
  # Replace the following with the specific doctor and employee IRIs
  FILTER (?doctor = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificDoctor> &&
          ?employee = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificEmployee>)
}

In a closed-world view, this query retrieves the evaluation statement by explicitly linking the reified evaluation instance with its doctor and employee through the properties defined in the ontology.
