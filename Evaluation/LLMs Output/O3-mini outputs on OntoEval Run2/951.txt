**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for each specific book or CD the articles that compose it using the property op_composedOf:

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?publication ?publicationTitle ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  # Select publications which are either books or CDs
  ?publication a ?pubType .
  FILTER(?pubType = :Cl_Book || ?pubType = :Cl_CD) .
  OPTIONAL { ?publication :dp_hasTitle ?publicationTitle . }
  
  # Retrieve the articles that the publication is composed of
  ?publication :op_composedOf ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article :dp_hasTitle ?articleTitle . }
}
ORDER BY ?publication ?article
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?” by extracting the relevant articles for each publication (either a book or a CD) defined in the ontology.
