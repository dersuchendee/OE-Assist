The ontology models article collections (both books and CDs) using the class ns1:ArticleCollection (with Book and CD as subclasses) and associates articles with them via the ns1:hasArticle property. Therefore, given a specific book or CD one can write a SPARQL query to extract the articles that compose it.

Below is an example SPARQL query (under a closed world assumption) that retrieves, for each book or CD, its label alongside the articles it is composed of:

PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?collection ?collectionLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?collection a ?collectionType .
  FILTER(?collectionType = ns1:Book || ?collectionType = ns1:CD) .
  OPTIONAL { ?collection rdfs:label ?collectionLabel } .
  ?collection ns1:hasArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel } .
}

This query will return each book or CD (the article collection) along with the articles (and their labels) that are part of it.
