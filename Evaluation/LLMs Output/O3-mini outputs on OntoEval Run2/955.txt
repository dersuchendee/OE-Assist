**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given Book or CD, the articles (members) that compose the collection:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?collection ?collectionLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  { ?collection a :Book . }
  UNION
  { ?collection a :CD . }
  
  OPTIONAL { ?collection rdfs:label ?collectionLabel . }
  ?collection :hasMember ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query answers the question “What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?” by retrieving any resource that is a Book or CD (both being ArticleCollections) and following the :hasMember property to list its articles.
