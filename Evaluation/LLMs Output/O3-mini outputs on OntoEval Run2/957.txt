**Yes**

The ontology defines media (with Cl_Media) with a subclass Cl_Book (and, by implication, other media types such as CDs may also be modelled as instances of Cl_Media). In addition, the properties 
  :composedOf (with domain Cl_Media and range Cl_ArticleCollection) and 
  :containsArticle (with domain Cl_ArticleCollection and range Cl_Article) 
connect a media item (e.g., a book or CD) to the articles it contains (whose titles can be retrieved via the property :articleTitle). Therefore, using the closed world assumption, one can write a SPARQL query to extract the answer.

For example, if you want to list the articles contained in a specific media item identified by its IRI (<http://www.example.org/test#MyMediaItem>), you could use the following query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?media ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?media a :Cl_Media .
  ?media :composedOf ?collection .
  ?collection :containsArticle ?article .
  ?article :articleTitle ?articleTitle .
  FILTER(?media = <http://www.example.org/test#MyMediaItem>)
}

This query retrieves the media item (book or CD), its associated article collection, and the titles of each article it is composed of.
