The ontology includes explicit classes for books and CDs (:Cl_Book and :Cl_CD) and models the relation “containsArticle” between these collections and articles (instances of :Cl_Article). Thus, we can directly write a SPARQL query to answer the CQ “What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?” Here is a sample query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?collection ?collectionLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  { ?collection a :Cl_Book }
  UNION
  { ?collection a :Cl_CD } .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?collection rdfs:label ?collectionLabel }
  
  ?collection :containsArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel }
}

This query retrieves each book or CD along with its associated articles, making the CQ fully supported by the ontology.
