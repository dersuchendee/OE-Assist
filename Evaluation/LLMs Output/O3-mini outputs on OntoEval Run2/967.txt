**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given book or CD, the articles it contains:

----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?bookOrCD ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  # Select a resource that is either a Book or a CD
  ?bookOrCD rdf:type ?type .
  FILTER(?type IN (:Cl_Book, :Cl_CD)) .

  # Get the articles contained within that resource using the :containsArticle property
  ?bookOrCD :containsArticle ?article .

  # Optionally retrieve the label of the article for display purposes
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel }
}
----------------------------------------------------

In this query a resource of type :Cl_Book or :Cl_CD is considered a specific book or CD, and its associated articles are extracted using the :containsArticle property. This shows that the competency question is modeled by the ontology.
