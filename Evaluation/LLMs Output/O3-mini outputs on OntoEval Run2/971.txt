**Yes**

The ontology supports this competency question because it models book and CD entities (using classes :Cl_Book and :Cl_CD) that are linked via the property :containsArticle to content entities (modeled as :Cl_Content, a subclass of :Cl_Article). This allows us to query for the articles (contents) that compose a specific book or CD.

For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves, for each book or CD, the articles it is composed of:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?bookOrCD ?bookLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  { ?bookOrCD a :Cl_Book }
  UNION
  { ?bookOrCD a :Cl_CD } .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?bookOrCD rdfs:label ?bookLabel . }
  ?bookOrCD :containsArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?bookOrCD ?article

This query shows that the competency question “What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?” can be fully answered via the ontology under the closed world assumption.
