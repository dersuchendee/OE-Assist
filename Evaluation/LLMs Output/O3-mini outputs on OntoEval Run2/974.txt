**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves the title of a book and its associated page count using the properties defined in the ontology (under closed world assumption):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
SELECT ?book ?title ?pages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :hasTitle ?title .
  ?book :hasBookDetails ?details .
  ?details :hasNumberOfPages ?pages .
}
  
This query extracts, for each book instance, its title and the number of pages recorded in its associated book details.
