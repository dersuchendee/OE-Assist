**Yes**

We can extract the total number of pages recorded for a book using the ontology. For example, if we want to retrieve the total pages for all books (or a specific book), we can use a query like this:

PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?book ?label ?totalPages
WHERE {
  ?book a ns1:Book ;
        ns1:hasTotalPages ?totalPages .
  OPTIONAL { ?book rdfs:label ?label . }
  # Uncomment the FILTER if you want to target a particular book, for example:
  # FILTER(?book = ns1:NursePracticesInCancerPatientCare)
} 

This query returns each book (and its label, if present) along with the total number of pages as modelled by the property ns1:hasTotalPages.
