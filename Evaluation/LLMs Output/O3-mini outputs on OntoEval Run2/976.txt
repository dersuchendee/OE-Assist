**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves books along with the number of pages recorded for each:

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/articlecollection#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?pageNumber
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book .
  ?book :pageNumber ?pageNumber .
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this query we assume that a bookâ€™s number of pages is explicitly stored in the data property :pageNumber. Under the closed world assumption, if no page number is present for a given book then that book is assumed not to have a recorded page count.
