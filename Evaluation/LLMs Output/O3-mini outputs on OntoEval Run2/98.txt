**Yes**

Using the provided ontology details, we see that festivals (or festival occurrences) are modelled with a class (e.g., Cl_FestivalOccurrence or Cl_TheatreFestival) that links to a city via an object property (such as occursIn) or a data property (hasLocation). For example, in the last snippet an individual (RomaLovesShakespeare2007) of type Cl_FestivalOccurrence is linked to a city (CityOfRome), which has a name "Rome". Under the closed‚Äêworld assumption (i.e. we assume only explicitly asserted facts exist), we can extract the answer "Rome" for the festival "Roma Loves Shakespeare."

A corresponding SPARQL query to extract where a festival took place could be written as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_FestivalOccurrence .
  ?festival :hasName ?festivalName .
  ?festival :occursIn ?city .
  ?city :hasName ?cityName .
  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?festivalName), "roma loves shakespeare"))
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query looks for instances of Cl_FestivalOccurrence that have a name containing "roma loves shakespeare" and retrieves the city (by its name) where the festival occurred.
