**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the number of pages for a particular book (assuming the book is identified by its IRI):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?bookLabel ?pages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?book rdfs:label ?bookLabel . }
  ?book :hasDetails ?details .
  ?details :numberOfPages ?pages .

  # Filter to a particular book (adjust the IRI as needed)
  FILTER(?book = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificBook>)
} 

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports the competency question “How many pages does a particular book contain?” by allowing us to extract the page count of a book through its associated book details via the :hasDetails and :numberOfPages properties.
