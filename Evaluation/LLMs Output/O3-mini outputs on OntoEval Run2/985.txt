**Yes**

The ontology includes a class for books (Cl_Book) with a data property “pageCount” that records the number of pages for a book. Therefore, the following SPARQL query can be written (using the closed‐world assumption) to extract the page count for a particular book (for example, one identified by its publication title):

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?title ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book ;
        :publicationTitle ?title ;
        :pageCount ?pageCount .
  FILTER(?title = "Nurse practices in cancer patient care – longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals")
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the book, its title, and its pageCount (which in the provided data is 346).
