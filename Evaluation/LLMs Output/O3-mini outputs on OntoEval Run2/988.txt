**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each book (identified as an instance of Cl_ArticleCollection, which is a subclass of Cl_Book), the number of pages recorded in the ontology:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?pages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  ?book :numberOfPages ?pages .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the answer to the competency question "How many pages does a particular book contain?" under a closed world assumption.
