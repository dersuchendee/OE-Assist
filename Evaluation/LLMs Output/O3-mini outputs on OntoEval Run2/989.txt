**Yes**

Assuming a closed‐world interpretation, the CQ “How many pages does a particular book contain?” is answerable from the ontology. For example, if we are interested in the book with title “Nurse practices in cancer patient care – longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals”, you can run the following SPARQL query:

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?bookTitle ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book ;
        :bookTitle ?bookTitle ;
        :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages .
  FILTER(?bookTitle = "Nurse practices in cancer patient care – longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals")
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the book (its URI), its title, and the number of pages as recorded in the ontology, thereby modeling the competency question.
