**Yes**

We can extract the location of a given festival (e.g., "Roma Loves Shakespeare") using the property ns1:tookPlaceIn. For instance, if we want to know where the festival ns1:RomaLovesShakespeare took place, we can use the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a ns1:TheatreFestival ;
            ns1:tookPlaceIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel. }
  FILTER(?festival = ns1:RomaLovesShakespeare)
}

This query shows that the location (the city) where the festival took place is modelled in the ontology, and thus our CQ is supported under the closed world assumption.
