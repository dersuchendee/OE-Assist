**Yes**

We can answer this competency question because the ontology includes a class for books (Cl_Book) along with a data property (:hasPageCount) defined with domain Cl_Book and range xsd:integer. Under the closed world assumption, we consider that every book instance that has a page count is explicitly represented in the data.

Example SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?book ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Cl_Book .
  ?book :hasPageCount ?pageCount .
}
