**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the number of pages for books (and can be further restricted to a particular book if desired):

-------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?book ?pages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :numberOfPages ?pages .
}
-------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports answering the CQ “How many pages does a particular book contain?”.
