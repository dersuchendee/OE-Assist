**Yes**

Assuming we know that books and CDs are represented as subclasses of ArticleCollection and they have a publication date asserted via the property :hasPublicationDate, you can extract the publication date for any Book or CD. For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves the publication date of any resource that is either a Book or a CD:

PREFIX ac: <http://example.org/articlecollection#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?collection ?pubDate
WHERE {
  ?collection a ?type .
  FILTER(?type = ac:Book || ?type = ac:CD)
  ?collection ac:hasPublicationDate ?pubDate .
}

This query directly answers the CQ “When was a certain book or CD published?” by extracting the publication date from the ontology.
