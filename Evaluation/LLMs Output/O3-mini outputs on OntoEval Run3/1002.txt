**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the publication date of any publication instance whose publication (reified via Cl_PublicationInstance) is a book or CD:

----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?publication ?publicationTitle ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?pubInstance a :Cl_PublicationInstance ;
               :publicationDate ?publicationDate ;
               :hasPublication ?publication .
  {
    ?publication a :Cl_Book .
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?publication a :Cl_CD .
  }
  OPTIONAL { ?publication :publicationTitle ?publicationTitle . }
}
----------------------------------------------------

In this query the closure is assumed (only the facts available in the ontology are considered). 
The query finds each publication instance with its publication date and checks that the underlying publication is either a book or a CD.
