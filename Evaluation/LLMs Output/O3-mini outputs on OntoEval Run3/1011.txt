**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves all instances of article collections (i.e. those representing books or CDs) along with their publication dates:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?bookOrCD ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  ?bookOrCD :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “When was a certain book or CD published?” since the ontology models books or CDs as instances of :Cl_ArticleCollection with an associated :publicationDate.
