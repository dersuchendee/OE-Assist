**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that returns the publication date of a book (or CD) by retrieving the publication date from a publication that is linked (via the property “publishedAs”) to a book (or CD):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?pubDate
WHERE {
  ?publication a :Cl_Publication ;
               :publicationDate ?pubDate ;
               :publishedAs ?book .
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  # Optionally, if you want to restrict to a specific title, uncomment the next line:
  # ?book :bookTitle "Nurse practices in cancer patient care – longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals" .
}

This query extracts the answer to the competency question “When was a certain book or CD published?” from the ontology (under closed world assumption).
