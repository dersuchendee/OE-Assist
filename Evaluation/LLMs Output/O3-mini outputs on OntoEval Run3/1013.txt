**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves all book or CD instances along with their publication dates:

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?item ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  { ?item a :Cl_Book. } UNION { ?item a :Cl_CD. }
  ?item :publicationDate ?publicationDate.
}
----------------------------------

In this query we assume that the instances of books or CDs are asserted as members of the classes :Cl_Book or :Cl_CD and that their publication date is stored using the :publicationDate property as defined in the ontology. This satisfies the competency question “When was a certain book or CD published?” under the closed world assumption.
