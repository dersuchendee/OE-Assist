**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the publication date for instances that are either books or CDs (using a closed world assumption by filtering only for those explicitly typed as :Cl_Book or :Cl_CD):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?publication ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?publication a ?pubType .
  FILTER (?pubType = :Cl_Book || ?pubType = :Cl_CD)
  ?publication :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}

─────────────────────────────

This query directly extracts the answer to the competency question “When was a certain book or CD published?” from the ontology.
