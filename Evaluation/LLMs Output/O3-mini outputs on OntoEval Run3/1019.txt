Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the date for seminar events by selecting individuals of type Seminar and their associated date. In a closed‐world setting (i.e. considering only what is explicitly asserted), if a “certain seminar” is identified in the data you can add additional filters (e.g. by its identifier or properties), but in general this query extracts the seminar dates:

PREFIX : <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/semanticscenario.owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasDate ?date .
  # Optionally, add filters here to select the intended seminar, for example:
  # ?seminar rdfs:label "Specific Seminar Name" .
}
ORDER BY ?date
