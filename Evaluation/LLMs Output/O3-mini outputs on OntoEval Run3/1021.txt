**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves seminars along with the date they took place:

PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a ns1:Seminar ;
           ns1:hasDate ?date .
}

This query retrieves all instances of ns1:Seminar that have an associated date via ns1:hasDate, which makes the competency question answerable under the closed world assumption.
