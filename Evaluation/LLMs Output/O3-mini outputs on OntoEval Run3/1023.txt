**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that returns the date for each seminar event by linking the seminar occurrence with its seminar and extracting its date:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?event a :Cl_SeminarEvent .
  ?event :P_isOccurrenceOf ?seminar .
  ?event :P_hasDate ?date .
  # Optionally, if you need to filter for a “certain seminar”, add a FILTER or VALUES clause below.
}
ORDER BY ?seminar ?date

This query shows that the ontology allows one to identify when a seminar took place by querying for its event date, so the CQ is modelled by the ontology.
