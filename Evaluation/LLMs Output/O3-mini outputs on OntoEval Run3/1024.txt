**Yes**

We can answer this CQ using the ontology because seminars are defined as a subclass of :Event and the event date is captured by the :eventDate datatype property. Under the closed world assumption, we assume that every seminar instance has exactly one event date recorded. For a specific seminar (e.g. by its title), the following SPARQL query extracts the seminarâ€™s event date:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?title ?eventDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Seminar ;
           :eventDate ?eventDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar :title ?title . }
  # You can add a filter to specify the seminar of interest, for example:
  # FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?title), "certain seminar title"))
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the seminar instance, its optional title, and the event date, which fully models the CQ "When did a certain seminar take place?"
