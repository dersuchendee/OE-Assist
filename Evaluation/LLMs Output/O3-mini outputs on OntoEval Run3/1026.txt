**Yes**

Assuming that the seminar instances are represented as individuals of class :Cl_Seminar and their date information is stored using the property :seminarDate, you can answer the CQ with a query like:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?date .
  # Optionally, if you want to restrict the query to a certain seminar,
  # you could add a FILTER or specify its URI directly.
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves each seminar and the date on which it took place, thereby fully modelling the competency question under a closed world assumption.
