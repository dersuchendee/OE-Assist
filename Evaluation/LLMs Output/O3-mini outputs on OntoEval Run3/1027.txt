**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves seminars together with the date they took place, based on the ontology’s use of Cl_Seminar and the associated property seminarDate:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “When did a certain seminar take place?” under the closed world assumption by returning the seminar instance(s) along with their seminar date(s).
