Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves seminars and the dates on which they took place:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
  # Optionally, if you want to restrict to a certain seminar by label or identifier, add a FILTER here:
  # ?seminar rdfs:label "Desired Seminar Label" .
}
