**Yes**

We can retrieve the date when a seminar took place from the ontology using the :Cl_Seminar class and its associated data property :seminarDate. A suitable SPARQL query is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}

This query collects all individuals of type :Cl_Seminar along with their associated seminar dates, thereby answering the CQ "When did a certain seminar take place?" under the closed world assumption.
