**Yes**

We can answer the CQ by querying for seminars (instances of Cl_Seminar) and retrieving their seminar dates. For instance:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}

This query returns the seminar (for example, :SeminarOnNursePractices) along with its recorded date, which answers “When did a certain seminar take place?” under the closed‐world assumption.
