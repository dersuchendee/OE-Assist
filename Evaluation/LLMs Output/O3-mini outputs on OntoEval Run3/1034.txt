**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves seminars and their dates from the ontology. In a closed‚Äêworld scenario, you would assume that every seminar instance has a recorded seminar date.

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" by extracting the date (using the :seminarDate property) for each instance of :Cl_Seminar in the ontology.
