**Yes**

Assuming that seminars (instances of :Cl_Seminar) in the ontology have an associated date via the data property :seminarDate, the following SPARQL query extracts the date when each seminar took place (under the closed world assumption that only explicitly stated data is available):

—————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
—————————————————————————————

This query will return the seminar(s) along with the date recorded in the ontology, thus supporting the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?"
