**Yes**

Assuming that a “certain seminar” is represented as an instance of the class Cl_Seminar and its occurrence is captured by the data property seminarDate, here is a SPARQL query that returns the seminar and the date it took place:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
} 

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question “When did a certain seminar take place?” under a closed world assumption.
