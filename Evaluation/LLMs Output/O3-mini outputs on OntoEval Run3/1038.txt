**Yes**

The ontology includes a dedicated class for seminars (Cl_Seminar) and a data property (seminarDate) specifying when a seminar took place. For example, to retrieve the date of a given seminar, you could use a query like this:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query returns each seminar instance along with its associated date, thus fully answering the competency question under the closed world assumption.
