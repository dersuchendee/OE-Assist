**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the seminar and its date using the class Cl_Seminar and its data property seminarDate:

----------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate
WHERE {
  ?seminar rdf:type :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate .
}
----------------

In a closed-world assumption, because the ontology explicitly provides a class for seminars with a seminarDate property, the competency question "When did a certain seminar take place?" is fully answerable.
