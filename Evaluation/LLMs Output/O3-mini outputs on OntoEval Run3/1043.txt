**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given seminar, the articles presented. In this ontology the seminar is linked to a “presentation event” (a reification class) which in turn “presents” an article. We use the closed world assumption and only consider those individuals explicitly in the ontology.

For example, to list all seminars and the articles presented in each seminar, you can use:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :hasSeminarDate ?seminarDate ;
           :hasPresentationEvent ?presentationEvent .
  ?presentationEvent :presentationOfArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { 
    ?article :hasTitle ?articleTitle .
  }
}
ORDER BY ?seminarDate

If you want to restrict the query to a “certain seminar” (for example, a seminar held on December 1, 2008), you could add a FILTER:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?seminar ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :hasSeminarDate ?date ;
           :hasPresentationEvent ?presentationEvent .
  FILTER(?date = "2008-12-01"^^xsd:date)
  
  ?presentationEvent :presentationOfArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article :hasTitle ?articleTitle . }
}

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question “What articles were presented in a certain seminar?” under the closed world assumption.
