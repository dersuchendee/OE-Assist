**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology models seminars and articles via seminar presentations (a seminar includes one or more presentations and each presentation is both a seminar and an article), we can write a SPARQL query that, given a specific seminar, retrieves the articles (i.e. seminar presentations) that were presented in it. Under the closed‐world assumption the absence of a stated relationship is taken as “false.”

For example, you could use this query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarIncludesPresentation ?presentation .
  ?presentation a :Cl_Article .
  BIND(?presentation AS ?article)
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
  
  # Filter for a certain seminar (replace <specific_seminar_URI> with the seminar URI)
  FILTER(?seminar = <specific_seminar_URI>)
}
ORDER BY ?article

This query confirms that the competency question "What articles were presented in a certain seminar?" is modelled by the ontology.
