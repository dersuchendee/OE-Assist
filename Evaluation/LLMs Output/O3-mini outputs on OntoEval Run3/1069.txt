**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the location of a seminar using the reified seminar event data modeled in the ontology:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?location ?locationLabel ?date
WHERE {
  ?seminarOccurrence a :Cl_SeminarEvent .
  ?seminarOccurrence :P_isOccurrenceOf ?seminar .
  ?seminarOccurrence :P_occursAt ?location .
  ?seminarOccurrence :P_hasDate ?date .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
  # Optionally, add FILTER clauses to select the “certain seminar” by date or other known characteristic
}
ORDER BY ?date
------------------------------------------------

In this query the competency question “Where did a certain seminar take place?” is answered by retrieving the location (?location) associated via the property :P_occursAt from the seminar event instance (?seminarOccurrence) that is linked to the seminar (?seminar) via the property :P_isOccurrenceOf. This shows that the ontology supports the CQ under a closed world assumption.
