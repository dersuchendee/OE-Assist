**Yes**

We can retrieve the festival’s location because the ontology links a festival (via its occurrence) to a city using the property “takesPlaceIn.” For example, if we want to know where “RomaLovesShakespeare” took place, we could write a query like this:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?occurrence ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_Festival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :takesPlaceIn ?city .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query extracts every festival’s occurrence along with the city in which the occurrence takes place, thus answering the competency question "Where did a certain festival take place?" under the closed world assumption.
