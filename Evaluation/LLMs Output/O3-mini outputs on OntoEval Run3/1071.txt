**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, extracts the location at which a seminar took place by relying on the property linking a seminar (an instance of Cl_Seminar) to its location (e.g. a Cl_Hospital or more generally a Cl_Location):

----------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }

  ?seminar :hasLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this query we are retrieving all seminars along with their associated locations. Under the closed‐world assumption we assume that if a seminar does not have a :hasLocation property then the seminar did not take place anywhere in the ontology, making the query answer complete.
