Assuming closed-world reasoning, the ontology explicitly models seminars using the class Cl_Seminar and indicates where a seminar is held via the property heldIn—for example, the individual :SeminarOnNursePractices is linked to the hospital :OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli. Based on this, the following SPARQL query retrieves the venue of seminars:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?venue ?venueLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :heldIn ?venue .
  OPTIONAL { ?venue rdfs:label ?venueLabel . }
}  

This query answers the CQ “Where did a certain seminar take place?” by returning the seminars and the venues at which they are held.
