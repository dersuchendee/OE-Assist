The CQ "Where did a certain seminar take place?" is fully answerable by the ontology as specified. In particular, seminars in the ontology are modelled as instances of the class Cl_Seminar that are linked to their venue (here a hospital) via the property takesPlaceAt. Under the closed world assumption, we assume that the provided triples are complete and an instance such as :SeminarOnNursePractices is known to take place at :OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli.

A possible SPARQL query to extract the seminar locations is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?seminar ?hospital
WHERE {
  ?seminar rdf:type :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :takesPlaceAt ?hospital .
}

This query will return the seminar(s) along with the hospital where the seminar took place.
