SELECT ?seminar ?seminarLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
  ?seminar :seminarLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}

This query extracts all individuals of type :Cl_Seminar and retrieves their associated location via the :seminarLocation property. This fully supports the competency question “Where did a certain seminar take place?” under the closed world assumption.
