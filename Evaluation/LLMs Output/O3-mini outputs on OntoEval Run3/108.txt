**Yes**

The following SPARQL query retrieves each theatre festival (an instance of Cl_TheatreFestival) along with its recorded location (via the dp_location property). Under the closed world assumption (i.e. we assume that the only location data is what is explicitly stated), this query extracts the answer to “Where did a certain festival take place?”
