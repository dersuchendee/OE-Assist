**Yes**

We can answer the CQ using the ontology because seminars are modelled as instances of :Cl_Seminar which have a property :seminarLocation linking them to a hospital. For example, if we want to retrieve the seminar and its location, we can write the following SPARQL query (assuming that seminar locations are explicitly asserted):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?hospital ?hospitalName
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarLocation ?hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalName. }
}

This query extracts the seminar instance(s) along with the hospital (its location) where the seminar took place, thus fully answering the competency question under the closed‚Äêworld assumption.
