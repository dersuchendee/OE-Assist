**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the city name for the given seminar (here, the December 2008 seminar):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?seminar ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar ;
           :seminarDate "2008-12-01"^^xsd:date .
  
  ?location a :Cl_SeminarLocation ;
            :locationOfSeminar ?seminar ;
            :locatedAt ?hospitalLocation .
            
  ?hospitalLocation :locatedIn ?city .
  ?city :cityName ?cityName .
}

ORDER BY ?seminar

This query navigates from the seminar, via its associated seminar location and then to the hospital location that is itself located in a city (whose name is returned). Since the question "Where did a certain seminar take place?" can be answered by extracting the city (in this case “Nocera Inferiore”), the CQ is supported by the ontology.
