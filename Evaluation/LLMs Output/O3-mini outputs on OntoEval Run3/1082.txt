**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the seminar along with the location where it took place:

------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?seminar ?seminarDate ?location
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarTookPlaceAt ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar :seminarDate ?seminarDate . }
}
------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, this query extracts the seminars that have an explicit location assigned via the property :seminarTookPlaceAt, thus directly answering the competency question "Where did a certain seminar take place?"
