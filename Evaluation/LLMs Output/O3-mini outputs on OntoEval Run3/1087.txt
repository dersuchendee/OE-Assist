Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves for each seminar the articles that are presented (either directly via the property presentsArticle or via the reified relation using hasPresentationEvent and presentationOfArticle). If every seminar has at least one presentation, then no seminar will be returned without an article.
