**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves seminars together with at least one presented article by following the chain from a seminar to a seminar presentation and finally to an article:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?seminar ?presentation ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :hasPresentation ?presentation .
  ?presentation :presentationOfArticle ?article .
}
ORDER BY ?seminar
---------------------------------

This query is answerable by the ontology under a closed world assumption, since the chain of properties (:hasPresentation and :presentationOfArticle) connects each instance of a seminar to at least one article (if present).
