**Yes**

The following SPARQL query retrieves each seminar along with the articles presented in it. Under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, if every seminar has at least one article linked (through a presentation instance), then the query result will include only those seminars that meet the competency question requirement.

PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?seminar ?seminarLabel (COUNT(?article) AS ?articleCount)
WHERE {
  ?article a :Cl_Article .
  ?article :presentedIn ?presentation .
  ?presentation :seminar ?seminar .
  OPTIONAL { ?seminar rdfs:label ?seminarLabel . }
}
GROUP BY ?seminar ?seminarLabel
HAVING (COUNT(?article) >= 1)
--------------------------------------------------

This query confirms that each seminar (instance of :Cl_Seminar reached via the :seminar property on a :Cl_SeminarPresentation) has at least one associated article, thus modeling the competency question.
