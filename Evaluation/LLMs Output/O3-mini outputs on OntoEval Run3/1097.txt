**No**  
The ontology does not enforce that every seminar must have at least one associated article (for example via a minimum cardinality restriction). Under the closed‐world assumption you can only extract the seminars that do have presented articles (or those missing one), which is only a partial answer to the CQ. For instance, the following query lists, per seminar, the number of articles presented. If any seminar has a count of zero, then the CQ “at least one article is always presented at each seminar” is not fully satisfied by the ontology.

SELECT ?seminar (COUNT(?article) AS ?numArticles)
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  OPTIONAL { 
    ?article :presentedAt ?seminar .
  }
}
GROUP BY ?seminar
HAVING(?numArticles = 0)

--------------------------------------------------

If the query returns any seminars, those seminars lack a presented article according to the ontology, indicating that the CQ is only partially answered.
