**Yes**
Below is a sample SPARQL query that retrieves each seminar along with the articles presented (ensuring that at least one article is linked to each seminar):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?seminar ?article
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :presentedArticle ?article .
}
ORDER BY ?seminar ?article

This query confirms that every instance of :Cl_Seminar has at least one associated :presentedArticle, which models the competency question "At least one article is always presented at each seminar" under a closed world assumption.
