**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, returns every seminar (of type :Cl_Seminar) along with the articles that were presented in it—thus showing that each seminar has at least one article presented.

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?seminar (COUNT(?article) AS ?articleCount)
WHERE {
  ?seminar a :Cl_Seminar .
  ?article :presentedIn ?seminar .
}
GROUP BY ?seminar
HAVING (?articleCount >= 1)

Because the ontology includes an OWL restriction on :Cl_Seminar stating a minimum cardinality of 1 for the property :presentedIn, the CQ “At least one article is always presented at each seminar” is indeed answerable by the ontology.
