**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, returns every seminar that includes at least one article presentation. In the ontology, a seminar (of type :Cl_Seminar) is linked to its presentation (of type :Cl_SeminarPresentation) via the property :seminarIncludesPresentation, and each presentation is associated with an article (of type :Cl_Article) via the property :presentedInSeminar. This query retrieves only those seminars for which at least one article is presented.

SELECT DISTINCT ?seminar
WHERE {
  ?seminar rdf:type :Cl_Seminar .
  ?seminar :seminarIncludesPresentation ?presentation .
  ?presentation :presentedInSeminar ?article .
}

In this way the competency question “At least one article is always presented at each seminar” is answerable by the ontology.
