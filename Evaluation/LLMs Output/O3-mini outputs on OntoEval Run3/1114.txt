SELECT ?person ?activity
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :op_isDoing ?activity .
  ?activity a :Cl_BrushingTeeth .
}
```

In this query we retrieve the person(s) along with their associated activity that is an instance of Cl_BrushingTeeth. Under the closed world assumption, only the explicitly modeled activities are returned, fulfilling the competency question “What is the user doing now?” as described in the story.
