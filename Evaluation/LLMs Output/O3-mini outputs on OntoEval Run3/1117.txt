**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the current activity performed by the user together with the activity that immediately preceded it (using the :previousActivity property):

PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?currentActivity ?currentLabel ?prevActivity ?prevLabel
WHERE {
  # Find a current activity performed by the user that has a previous activity.
  ?currentActivity a :Activity ;
                   :performedBy :User ;
                   :previousActivity ?prevActivity .
  OPTIONAL { ?currentActivity rdfs:label ?currentLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?prevActivity rdfs:label ?prevLabel . }
}

  
This query directly uses the :previousActivity relation defined in the ontology to answer the competency question "What did the user do previously?" under the closed world assumption.
