**Yes**

Assuming that “a certain festival” is represented as an instance of Cl_TheatreFestival that is connected via the object property :hasLocation to an instance of Cl_FestivalLocation (which in turn provides the information through the :locationName data property), you can extract “where” information with the following query under a closed world assumption:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasLocation ?loc .
  ?loc :locationName ?locationName .
}

This query finds all the festivals together with the names of their associated locations.
