**Yes**

Assuming the ontologyâ€™s TBox is taken under a closed world view, we can answer the CQ because we can extract the devices (and their functionalities) that provide weather information. For instance, devices that have the property :displaysWeather (e.g. SmartMirror) are used to display content, while those with :announcesWeather (e.g. SmartSpeaker) announce content.

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the smart bathroom devices along with the functionality used to deliver the content:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/onto#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?device ?deviceLabel ?functionality ?functionalityLabel
WHERE {
  ?device a :SmartBathroomDevice .
  OPTIONAL { ?device rdfs:label ?deviceLabel . }
  
  { ?device :displaysWeather ?functionality . }
  UNION
  { ?device :announcesWeather ?functionality . }
  
  OPTIONAL { ?functionality rdfs:label ?functionalityLabel . }
}

This query extracts each smart bathroom device that supports weather content delivery and the associated functionality (display or audio) used for that purpose.
