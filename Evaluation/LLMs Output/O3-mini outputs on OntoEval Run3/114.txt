**Yes**
Below is one example of an answer‐extracting SPARQL query. In this query we assume that a “festival” is an instance of Cl_TheatreFestival and that its location is available via the property locatedIn (with the location’s locationName). You could further restrict the query (for example by filtering on a specific festival name).

SELECT ?festival ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :locatedIn ?city .
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locationName ?locationName .
  # Optionally, restrict to a particular festival:
  # ?festival rdfs:label "Festival Name" .
}
----------------------------------------

This query retrieves each festival’s location (by its location name) as modelled in the ontology.
