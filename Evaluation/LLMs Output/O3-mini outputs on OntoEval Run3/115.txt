**Yes**

Assuming that festival instances are represented as individuals of type Cl_TheatreFestival and that their location is linked via the object property locatedIn to an instance of Cl_FestivalLocation (which then carries the city name via the data property locationCity), a SPARQL query to answer “Where did a certain festival take place?” could be written as follows:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festLabel ?location ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festLabel. }
  ?festival :locatedIn ?location .
  ?location :locationCity ?city .
  # Optionally, to target a specific festival, add a FILTER here, e.g.:
  # FILTER(?festLabel = "Roma Loves Shakespeare")
}

This query retrieves each festival, its optional label, its location instance, and finally the city name where it took place.
