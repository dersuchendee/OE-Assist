**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world reading, retrieves for each material its declared origin and – using a recursive property path – its production chain (the “trace”) by following the process links:

----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?material ?origin ?traceMaterial
WHERE {
  ?material a :Material ;
            :hasOrigin ?origin .
  # Follow the chain: from a material produced by a process,
  # that process consumes some precursor material, which in turn is produced by another process, etc.
  OPTIONAL {
    ?material :producedByProcess/(:consumesMaterial/:producesMaterial)+ ?traceMaterial .
  }
}
ORDER BY ?material ?traceMaterial
----------------------------------------

Explanation:
• The query selects each ?material, its associated ?origin (via the :hasOrigin property), and any ?traceMaterial that is reached by one or more steps along the chain producedByProcess/consumesMaterial then producesMaterial.
• The use of the "+" in the property path ensures that, if available, at least one step is taken to retrieve precursor material(s), thereby capturing the “complete trace” of the material.
• Under the closed‐world assumption, if some parts of a material’s chain are not asserted, they won’t appear in the results.
