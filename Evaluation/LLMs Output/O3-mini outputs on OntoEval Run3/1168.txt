**Yes**

The ontology links an Implementation Action to an Effect via the property :hasEffect, and the Effect is connected to an External Factor (which may be a SocialFactor or EnvironmentalFactor) through :affectsFactor. Assuming a closed world, we can extract the relevant effects – and their corresponding implementation actions – that impact social and environmental factors with the following SPARQL query:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?action ?actionLabel ?effect ?effectLabel ?factor ?factorLabel
WHERE {
  ?action a :ImplementationAction .
  OPTIONAL { ?action rdfs:label ?actionLabel. }
  
  ?action :hasEffect ?effect .
  OPTIONAL { ?effect rdfs:label ?effectLabel. }
  
  ?effect :affectsFactor ?factor .
  OPTIONAL { ?factor rdfs:label ?factorLabel. }
  
  FILTER (?factor = :SocialFactor || ?factor = :EnvironmentalFactor)
}
------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves all implementation actions with their associated effects and restricts the affected factors to those that are either :SocialFactor or :EnvironmentalFactor, thus answering the CQ under the closed world assumption.
