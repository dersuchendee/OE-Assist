**Yes**

Assuming a closed world where only the explicitly asserted location is considered, we can answer the question by retrieving the location value for each instance of Cl_TheatreFestival. For instance, the following SPARQL query extracts the locations of festivals:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?location
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :hasLocation ?location .
}

This query answers the competency question "Where did a certain festival take place?" by directly returning each festival along with its recorded location.
