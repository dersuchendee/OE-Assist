**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that distinguishes a set of bells by whether they are played manually, electrically, or both, by checking the ontologyâ€™s defined classes:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?setOfBells ?playType
WHERE {
  {
    ?setOfBells a :SetOfBellsPlayedManuallyAndElectrically .
    BIND("Manually and Electrically" AS ?playType)
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?setOfBells a :SetOfBellsPlayedManually .
    BIND("Manually" AS ?playType)
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?setOfBells a :SetOfBellsPlayedElectrically .
    BIND("Electrically" AS ?playType)
  }
}
ORDER BY ?setOfBells

In this query we assume a closed world where only the explicitly asserted types exist. This retrieves the set of bells classified by the play method used, thereby answering the CQ.
