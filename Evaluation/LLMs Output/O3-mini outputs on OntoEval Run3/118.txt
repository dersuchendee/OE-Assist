**Yes**

We can answer this CQ because the ontology models theatre festivals with a reification class (:Cl_TheatreFestival) that is linked via the object property :locatedIn to a reified location class (:Cl_FestivalLocation). The location class has the data property :locationCity that holds the city (geographic location). Under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, if a festival instance has no associated location information (via :locatedIn), then we assume that location is not recorded. Below is a SPARQL query that extracts, for each festival, the city in which the festival took place:

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?city
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  ?festival :locatedIn ?location .
  ?location :locationCity ?city .
