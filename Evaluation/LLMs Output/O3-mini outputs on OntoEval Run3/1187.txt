**Yes**

We can answer this competency question using the ontology. The idea is to retrieve any MeetingEvent instance that has both musician X and performer Y participating, along with its time, place, and (optionally) reason. Assuming the individuals are represented as :MusicianX and :PerformerY, one possible SPARQL query under the closed world assumption is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?event ?time ?place ?reason
WHERE {
  ?event a :MeetingEvent ;
         :hasParticipant :MusicianX ;
         :hasParticipant :PerformerY ;
         :atTime ?time ;
         :atPlace ?place .
  OPTIONAL { ?event :hasReason ?reason . }
} 

This query extracts any meeting event where both musician X and performer Y participated, and returns the time, place, and, if available, the reason for the meeting.
