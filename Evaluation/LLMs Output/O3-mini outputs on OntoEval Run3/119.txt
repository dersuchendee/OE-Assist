**No**

The ontology does not explicitly connect a theatre festival individual with its play appearances via the :hasProduction property (or another linking property), meaning we can’t fully answer “What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?” from the given assertions. However, a partial answer can be extracted by retrieving festival play appearances whose IRIs suggest they belong to a particular festival. For example, assuming that the reified production individuals’ identifiers include the festival name (like “RomaLovesShakespeare”), a partial SPARQL query for the festival "Roma Loves Shakespeare" could be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?appearance ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival ;
            :hasName ?festivalName .
  FILTER(?festivalName = "Roma Loves Shakespeare")
  
  ?appearance a :Cl_FestivalPlayAppearance ;
              :featuresPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasName ?playName . }
  
  # Partial matching based on naming convention in the IRI
  FILTER(regex(str(?appearance), "RomaLovesShakespeare", "i"))
}

This query provides a partial answer under the closed world assumption by selecting reified play appearances whose names imply association with the festival even though an explicit connection is missing in the ontology.
