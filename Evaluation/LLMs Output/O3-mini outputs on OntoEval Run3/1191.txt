**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves each event and indicates whether it is a religious or a secular event:

--------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?event 
       (IF(EXISTS { ?event a :ReligiousEvent }, "Religious", 
           IF(EXISTS { ?event a :SecularEvent }, "Secular", "Not Classified")
          ) AS ?classification)
WHERE {
  ?event a :Event .
}
ORDER BY ?event
--------------------------------------------------------

This query works by first selecting all individuals of type :Event. It then uses the IF(EXISTS{â€¦}) construct to check whether an event is explicitly declared as a :ReligiousEvent or a :SecularEvent. If neither is the case, the query returns "Not Classified", thus providing a complete answer under the closed world assumption.
