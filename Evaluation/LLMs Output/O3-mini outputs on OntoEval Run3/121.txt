Below is one possible SPARQL query that returns, for a given theatre festival, the names of the plays that were presented. This query assumes that the festival is linked to its productions (using, for example, the property :hasProduction) and that each production is linked to its play via the property :hasPlay, with the playâ€™s name given by the data property :hasName:

  ?production :hasPlay ?play .

ORDER BY ?festivalName ?playName

This query is written under the closed-world assumption and uses the reification pattern modeled in the ontology.
