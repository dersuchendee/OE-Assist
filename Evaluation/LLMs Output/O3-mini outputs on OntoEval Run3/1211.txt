**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that answers the CQ. It retrieves, for a given tune family X and a given similarity measure Y, the target tune families that are related:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?targetTuneFamily ?targetLabel
WHERE {
  # Given instances for tune family X and similarity measure Y
  :tuneFamilyX a :TuneFamily .
  :similarityMeasureY a :SimilarityMeasure .
  
  # Find SimilarityRelation where tuneFamilyX is the source and the relation uses similarityMeasureY
  ?relation a :SimilarityRelation ;
            :hasSourceTuneFamily :tuneFamilyX ;
            :hasSimilarityMeasure :similarityMeasureY ;
            :hasTargetTuneFamily ?targetTuneFamily .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?targetTuneFamily rdfs:label ?targetLabel . }
}
------------------------------------------------

In a closed world setting (i.e. assuming no unstated facts), this query correctly extracts the answer to the CQ "To what tune families is tune family X related, given similarity measure Y?"
