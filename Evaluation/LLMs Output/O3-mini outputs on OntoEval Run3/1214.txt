**Yes**

We can retrieve the aquatic microbe species that are found in an environment having at least one chemical characteristic using the structure defined in the ontology. Under a closed world assumption, we assume that if an individual is not stated, it does not exist, so the query below finds AquaticMicrobeSpecies that are linked via the :isFoundInEnvironment property to an environment which in turn is connected (via :hasChemicalCharacteristic) to a ChemicalCharacteristic.
