**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, extracts the characteristics of rare species found in a specific aquifer (here represented by a placeholder URI that you can replace with the desired aquifer):

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?species ?speciesLabel ?characteristic ?characteristicLabel
WHERE {
  ?species a :RareSpecies ;
           :isFoundIn ?aquifer ;
           :hasCharacteristic ?characteristic .
  ?aquifer a :Aquifer .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?species rdfs:label ?speciesLabel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?characteristic rdfs:label ?characteristicLabel. }
  
  # Restrict to a specific aquifer (replace the URI with the desired aquifer instance)
  FILTER(?aquifer = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificAquifer>)
}
------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
• The query selects individuals of type RareSpecies (i.e. species with rarity status "rare" as defined in the ontology).
• It ensures that these species are found in an aquifer by linking via the :isFoundIn property and confirming the aquifer is an instance of :Aquifer.
• It retrieves their associated characteristics via :hasCharacteristic.
• A FILTER is used to select a specific aquifer (adjust the URI as needed). 

This demonstrates that the ontology models the competency question.
