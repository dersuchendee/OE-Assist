Explanation:
The competency question asks for the different forms of carbon fixation in forest soils. In the ontology, the class FormOfCarbonFixation is a subclass of CarbonFixationProcess with a restriction that it occurs in ForestSoil. Under the closed world assumption, this query retrieves all classes satisfying that restriction, thereby modelling the competency question.
