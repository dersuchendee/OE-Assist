**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves the role played by forest soil composition in the CO2 fixation process:

————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?forestSoilComp ?role ?roleLabel
WHERE {
  ?forestSoilComp a :ForestSoilComposition ;
                  :playsRoleIn ?role .
  FILTER(?role = :CO2FixationProcess)
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel . }
}
————————————————————————————

This query finds the class that represents forest soil composition and extracts its defined role—namely, its connection via the property :playsRoleIn to the :CO2FixationProcess as indicated by the ontology.
