**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the plays seen during a given theatre festival by linking the festival’s participation assertions to productions and then to plays:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?theatreFestival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?theatreFestival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatreFestival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel. }
  
  ?theatreFestival :hasFestivalParticipation ?part .
  ?production :hasProductionParticipation ?part .
  ?production :isProductionOf ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel. }
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query answers the CQ by extracting the plays associated with the festival through the intermediate reified participation resource.
