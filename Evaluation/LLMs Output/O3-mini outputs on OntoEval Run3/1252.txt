**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves for each area the counts of chemical and physical measurements recorded:

---------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?area 
       (COUNT(DISTINCT ?chemMeasurement) AS ?chemicalCount)
       (COUNT(DISTINCT ?physMeasurement) AS ?physicalCount)
WHERE {
  ?area a :Area .
  OPTIONAL { ?area :hasChemicalMeasurement ?chemMeasurement . }
  OPTIONAL { ?area :hasPhysicalMeasurement ?physMeasurement . }
}
GROUP BY ?area
ORDER BY ?area
---------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question – "How are chemical and physical measurements distributed spatially across different areas?" – by retrieving each area (representing a spatial location) along with the number (distribution) of chemical and physical measurements associated with it.
