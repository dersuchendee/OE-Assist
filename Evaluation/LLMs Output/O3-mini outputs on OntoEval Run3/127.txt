**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for each theatre festival the plays that have been scheduled (via the :hasPlay property):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  ?festival :hasPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?play
--------------------------------------------------

This query lists all theatre festivals (which could correspond to “a certain theatre festival” when further constrained) and extracts the plays associated with them via the :hasPlay property.
