**Yes**

The ontology supports the competency question. The mounting system is linked to its execution techniques through the “allowsExecutionTechnique” property. For a given mounting system, you can extract the possible execution techniques with a query such as:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?mountingSystem ?executionTechnique ?techniqueLabel
WHERE {
  ?mountingSystem a :MountingSystem .
  ?mountingSystem :allowsExecutionTechnique ?executionTechnique .
  OPTIONAL { ?executionTechnique rdfs:label ?techniqueLabel . }
  # Replace the IRI below with the specific mounting system of interest
  FILTER (?mountingSystem = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificMountingSystem>) 
}
---------------------------------

This query retrieves the execution technique(s) allowed by a specific mounting system, along with any available labels.
