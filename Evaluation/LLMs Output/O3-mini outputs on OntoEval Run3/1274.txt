**Yes**  
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves each BellSet along with its associated playing methods (Manual, Electric, or both):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?bellSet (GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT ?playingMethodLabel; separator=", ") AS ?playingMethods)
WHERE {
  ?bellSet a :BellSet .
  ?bellSet :hasPlayingMethod ?playingMethod .
  OPTIONAL { ?playingMethod rdfs:label ?playingMethodLabel. }
  # In a closed-world fashion, we focus on the two explicitly modeled methods  
  FILTER(?playingMethod IN (:Manual, :Electric))
}
GROUP BY ?bellSet
------------------------------------------------

This query verifies whether a BellSet is played manually, electrically, or by both methods as required by the CQ.
