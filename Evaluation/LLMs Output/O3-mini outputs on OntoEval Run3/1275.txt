**No**

The ontology does not capture the distinctions “by hand” versus “by electric means” explicitly. We can extract, for every bell tower, the current SoundPractice and its associated SoundMethod, but since no modeling is provided in the ontology to differentiate between manual and electric sound methods (e.g. via a datatype property or individuals labelled “hand” or “electric”), the CQ is only partially answerable.

A SPARQL query that retrieves the available data is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?bellTower ?btLabel ?soundMethod ?smLabel
WHERE {
  ?bellTower a :BellTower .
  OPTIONAL { ?bellTower rdfs:label ?btLabel . }
  
  ?bellTower :currentSoundPractice ?soundPractice .
  ?soundPractice :hasMethod ?soundMethod .
  OPTIONAL { ?soundMethod rdfs:label ?smLabel . }
}
