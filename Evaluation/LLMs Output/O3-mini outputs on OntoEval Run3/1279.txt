**Yes**

Assuming that the musician “Z” is identified (for example, by an rdfs:label "Musician Z"), we can write a SPARQL query that uses the ontology’s properties (:participatesIn and :hasLocation) to retrieve the places associated with the events in which the musician participated. Here is one such query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?place ?placeLabel 
WHERE {
  ?musician a :Musician ;
            rdfs:label ?musLabel .
  FILTER(?musLabel = "Musician Z") .
  
  ?musician :participatesIn ?event .
  ?event :hasLocation ?place .
  OPTIONAL { ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel . }
}

This query extracts all distinct places (and optionally their labels) that are associated with the events in which musician Z participated, thereby answering the competency question.
