**Yes**

Assuming that a “certain theatre festival” is represented as an instance of :Cl_TheatreFestival, and that each festival is linked to the plays it features via the property :features, the CQ is fully answerable by the ontology. Under the closed world assumption, we assume that all information about the festival’s plays is explicitly modelled.

For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves, for a given festival, the plays that were featured:

-------------------------------------------------

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  ?festival :features ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  
  # For a specific festival, you could add a filter, for example:
  # FILTER(?festival = <http://www.example.org/test#RomaLovesShakespeare>)
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the plays featured by each theatre festival, thereby fully addressing the competency question.
