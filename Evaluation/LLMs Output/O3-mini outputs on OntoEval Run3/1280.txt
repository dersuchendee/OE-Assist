**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that assumes “she” is identified by a known IRI (here used as <http://www.example.org/test#She>). The query retrieves each performance event where that musician performed and the corresponding location where the event took place.

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performanceEvent ?location ?time
WHERE {
  ?performanceEvent a :PerformanceEvent ;
                    :performedBy <http://www.example.org/test#She> ;
                    :performedAt ?location ;
                    :hasTime ?time .
}
ORDER BY ?time

This query shows that the CQ “Where did she perform?” is answerable using the provided ontology under a closed-world assumption.
