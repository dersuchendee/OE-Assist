SELECT DISTINCT ?meeting ?location ?time ?reason
WHERE {
  ?meeting a :Meeting ;
           :hasLocation ?location ;
           :hasTime ?time ;
           :hasReason ?reason ;
           :hasParticipant ?participant1 ;
           :hasParticipant ?participant2 .
  
  ?participant1 a :Musician ;
                rdfs:label "Musician X" .
  ?participant2 a :Performer ;
                rdfs:label "Performer Y" .
}

This query works under the closed world assumption: if there is no meeting recorded where these two individuals participated, the query will simply return no results.
