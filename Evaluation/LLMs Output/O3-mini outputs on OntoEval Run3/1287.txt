**Yes**

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?event ?payer ?payerLabel
WHERE {
  ?payment a :Payment .
  ?payment :supportsEvent ?event .
  ?payment :hasPayer ?payer .
  OPTIONAL { ?payer rdfs:label ?payerLabel . }
}
```

This query retrieves each event along with its associated paymentâ€™s payer, thus answering the competency question "Who paid to support the event?" based on the given ontology under the closed world assumption.
