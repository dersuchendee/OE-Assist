**No**

The ontology does not capture any travel-related information (e.g. details about traveling or movement to reach a place), so we cannot fully answer “Did they travel to reach the place?” under a closed-world assumption. However, you can at least extract related information (e.g. which persons participated in meeting events) as a partial answer:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personLabel ?event ?eventLabel
WHERE {
  ?event a :MeetingEvent .
  OPTIONAL { ?event rdfs:label ?eventLabel . }
  
  ?event :hasParticipation ?participation .
  ?participation :involvesPerson ?person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?person ?event

This query retrieves persons and the meeting events they participate in, but note that as the travel concept is not modelled in the ontology, the query only provides a partial answer.
