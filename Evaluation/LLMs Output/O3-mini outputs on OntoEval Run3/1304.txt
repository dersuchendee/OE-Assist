**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves all compositions for a given tune family “X” (assuming that “X” is represented as an individual or can be identified by an rdfs:label):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?composition ?compositionLabel
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition ;
               :memberOf ?tuneFamily .
  # Either compare the tune family directly if its URI is known, e.g., :X:
  FILTER(?tuneFamily = :X)
  
  OPTIONAL {
    ?composition rdfs:label ?compositionLabel .
  }
} 

In the above query, we assume a closed‐world perspective where all relevant information is explicitly stated. This query returns the compositions that are members of the specified tune family X, thereby fully capturing the competency question.
