**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, extracts for a given tune family “X” and a given measure type “Y” the measure values associated with each composition. (Replace "X" and "Y" with the literal value or use appropriate IRIs as needed.)

SELECT ?composition ?compositionLabel ?measureValue
WHERE {
  ?composition a :Composition ;
               :belongsToTuneFamily ?tuneFamily ;
               :hasMeasure ?measure .
  ?tuneFamily rdfs:label ?tuneFamilyLabel .
  FILTER(?tuneFamilyLabel = "X")
  
  ?measure :measureType ?measureType ;
           :measureValue ?measureValue .
  ?measureType rdfs:label ?measureTypeLabel .
  FILTER(?measureTypeLabel = "Y")
  
  OPTIONAL { ?composition rdfs:label ?compositionLabel }
}
ORDER BY ?composition

This query retrieves all compositions in the given tune family X along with their measure values for measure type Y. By comparing the ?measureValue across compositions, one can assess similarities and differences as required by the CQ.
