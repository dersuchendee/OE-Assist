**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the plays that participated in a given theatre festival (here using any festival instance, with the possibility to restrict to “a certain” one by its URI):

------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?occurrence ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasFestivalOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :hasPlayParticipation ?participation .
  ?participation :participatedPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?occurrence ?play
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to filter for a specific festival (for example, Festival_RomaLovesShakespeare), you can add:

  FILTER(?festival = :Festival_RomaLovesShakespeare)

This query leverages the relationships defined in the ontology (from a festival to its occurrence(s), and from the occurrence to each play participation via the property participatedPlay) to answer the competency question under a closed-world assumption.
