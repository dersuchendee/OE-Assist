**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each theatre festival instance, the names of the plays associated with that festival:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :festivalName ?festivalName .
  ?festival :hasPlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
ORDER BY ?festivalName ?playName
------------------------------------------------

In this query we assume a closed world (all relevant plays and their relationships are declared in the ontology) and the CQ “What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?” can be answered using the property :hasPlay together with the data property :playName.
