Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, finds for each disease category the hospital whose associated HospitalStatistic registers the maximum average length of stay:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?diseaseCategory ?hospital ?maxAvgLengthOfStay
WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?diseaseCategory (MAX(?avgLength) AS ?maxAvgLengthOfStay)
    WHERE {
      ?stat a :HospitalStatistic ;
            :hasAverageLengthOfStay ?avgLength ;
            :forDiseaseCategory ?diseaseCategory .
    }
    GROUP BY ?diseaseCategory
  }
  ?stat2 a :HospitalStatistic ;
         :hasAverageLengthOfStay ?maxAvgLengthOfStay ;
         :forDiseaseCategory ?diseaseCategory ;
         :recordedBy ?hospital .
}
ORDER BY ?diseaseCategory
