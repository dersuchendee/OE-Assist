**No**
The current ontology does not explicitly model location information for parts of an organ. However, if we assume that “original parts” could be identified via a property such as arco:isCurrentParthood (with a value true indicating that the part is still original) and that organs include parts through arco:includesPart, we can partially extract those parts. For example, the following SPARQL retrieves—for each organ—the parts marked as current (i.e. original), even though no explicit spatial “location” is given:

PREFIX organs: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/organs/>
PREFIX arco: <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/>

SELECT ?organ ?part ?isCurrent
WHERE {
  ?organ a organs:Organ .
  ?organ arco:includesPart ?part .
  ?part arco:isCurrentParthood ?isCurrent .
  FILTER(?isCurrent = true)
}

This query only provides a partial answer (i.e. a list of parts assumed to be “original”) because the ontology does not include information about “where” (spatial location) those parts are located.
