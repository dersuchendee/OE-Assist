**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves for each theatre festival its associated plays (via the reified class :Cl_FestivalPlays) and their names:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?playName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  ?festival :hasPlay ?festivalPlay .
  ?festivalPlay :playName ?playName .
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?playName

This query shows that the competency question—“What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?”—is modelled in the ontology since we can extract the list of plays (their names) for each festival instance via the reified property :hasPlay connecting to :Cl_FestivalPlays.
