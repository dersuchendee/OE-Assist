**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model the “weight” of a bell (i.e. there is no property defined for weight), so we cannot fully answer the CQ. Under a closed world assumption we assume weight data is absent unless explicitly asserted. However, a partial answer can be attempted with a query that retrieves bells and (if available) a weight property.

Below is a SPARQL query that extracts bells and an optional weight (using a hypothetical property bells:hasWeight):

PREFIX bells: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/bell/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?bell ?bellLabel ?weight
WHERE {
  ?bell a bells:Bell .
  OPTIONAL { ?bell rdfs:label ?bellLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?bell bells:hasWeight ?weight . }
}

This query returns all instances of bells and, if available, their weight. Since the ontology does not model weight, the weight column will likely remain unpopulated.
