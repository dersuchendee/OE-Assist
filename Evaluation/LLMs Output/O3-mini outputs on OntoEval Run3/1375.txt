**No**  
The available ontology does not clearly model "musician Z" as a specific individual with attributes (such as being a musician) that can be directly linked to meetups. However, we can extract a partial answer by retrieving the places of meetups that include a participant having a label that contains “musician Z”. For example, one may run the following SPARQL query (applying a closed‐world assumption to regard what is not stated as false):

PREFIX mtps: <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?place ?placeLabel
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasParticipant ?participant .
  ?participant rdfs:label ?participantLabel .
  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?participantLabel), "musician z"))
  ?meetup mtps:hasPlace ?place .
  OPTIONAL { ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel. }
}

This query retrieves the locations (places) associated with meetups where a participant whose label contains “musician z” is involved, giving a partial answer to the CQ.
