**Yes**

Assuming that “musician X” and “performer Y” are represented in the ontology as individuals of type mtps:Participant (using, for instance, the URIs <http://example.org/musicianX> and <http://example.org/performerY>), one can answer the CQ by retrieving meetups where both appear as participants, and then extracting the place (mtps:hasPlace), time (mtps:happensAt), and the purpose (mtps:hasAPurpose) of the meetup. Under a closed-world assumption, only explicitly stated information is returned. For example, one can use the following SPARQL query:

----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX mtps: <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#>
PREFIX core: <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/core/>

SELECT ?meetup ?place ?time ?purpose
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup .
  ?meetup mtps:hasParticipant <http://example.org/musicianX> .
  ?meetup mtps:hasParticipant <http://example.org/performerY> .
  ?meetup mtps:hasPlace ?place .
  ?meetup mtps:happensAt ?time .
  ?meetup mtps:hasAPurpose ?purpose .
}
ORDER BY ?time
----------------------------------------------------------

This query will return all meetups where musician X and performer Y are both participants, along with the corresponding location, time, and purpose—fully answering the CQ.
