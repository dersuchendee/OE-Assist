**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves each meetup along with its purpose, which represents the “nature” of the event as modelled in the ontology:

PREFIX mtps: <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?meetup ?purpose ?purposeLabel
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup ;
          mtps:hasAPurpose ?purpose .
  OPTIONAL { ?purpose rdfs:label ?purposeLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?meetup

This query extracts the required information under the closed world assumption, as all meetups are required to have a purpose (i.e., a defined nature of the event).
