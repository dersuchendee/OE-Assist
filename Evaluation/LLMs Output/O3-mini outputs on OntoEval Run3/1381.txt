**No**

The ontology does not model any concept or property related to “payment” or “support” for an event. Consequently, while we can retrieve the participants (and potentially their roles) in a meetup, we cannot determine from the ontology who “paid to support the event.” Below is a SPARQL query that returns a partial answer by listing all participants (with their roles, if available) for each meetup:

PREFIX mtps: <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?meetup ?participant ?participantLabel ?role ?roleLabel
WHERE {
  ?meetup a mtps:Meetup ;
          mtps:hasParticipant ?participant .
  OPTIONAL { ?participant rdfs:label ?participantLabel . }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?participant mtps:hasRole ?role .
    OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel . }
  }
}
