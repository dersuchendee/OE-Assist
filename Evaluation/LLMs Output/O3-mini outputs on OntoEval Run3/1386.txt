**No**

The provided ontology does not include an explicit property that links a composition (represented as a :Tune) to a :TuneFamily. Therefore, while we know the classes exist, the ontology does not enable a complete answer to “Which tune family does composition X belong to?” under the closed world assumption. Below is a partial SPARQL query that retrieves a :Tune instance (filtered as “composition X”) and any family association if, by chance, such a linking property (e.g., an assumed :belongsToTuneFamily) were present.

SELECT ?composition ?compositionLabel ?tuneFamily ?tuneFamilyLabel
WHERE {
  # Retrieve the composition X (update the URI as needed)
  BIND(<http://example.org/compositionX> AS ?composition)
  ?composition a :Tune .
  OPTIONAL { ?composition rdfs:label ?compositionLabel. }

  # Attempt to retrieve a (non-modeled) association to TuneFamily, if any.
  OPTIONAL { ?composition :belongsToTuneFamily ?tuneFamily. }
  OPTIONAL { ?tuneFamily rdfs:label ?tuneFamilyLabel. }
}
--------------------------------------------------------

Since the property linking a composition to a tune family (here suggested as :belongsToTuneFamily) is not defined in the ontology, the query will return results only if such a property is asserted. Hence, the competency question is not fully supported by the ontology.
