**No**

The ontology does not capture any explicit property or relation that indicates the level of confidence regarding whether a particular composition (i.e. a Tune) is a variant of a given Tune Family. Without a property (for example, something like :hasConfidence or a reified association that includes a confidence measure), it is not possible under the closed world assumption to fully answer the CQ. We can only partially list the candidate compositions and tune families, but the CQâ€™s critical aspect (the confidence level) is missing.
