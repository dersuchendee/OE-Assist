SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?play ?playLabel ?city ?dateValue
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  
  ?festival :featuresPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  
  OPTIONAL { 
    ?festival :takesPlaceIn ?city .
  }
  
  OPTIONAL {
    ?festival :hasDate ?date .
    ?date :dateValue ?dateValue .
  }
}
ORDER BY ?festival ?play

In a closed world (i.e. assuming available facts cover the scenario), this query allows one to extract the answer for the competency question “What plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?” directly from the ontology.
