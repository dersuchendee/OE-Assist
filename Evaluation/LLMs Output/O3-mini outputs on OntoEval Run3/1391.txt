**No**  
The ontology does not explicitly model a relationship between tune families based on a similarity measure Y. Therefore, you cannot exactly extract “tune families related to tune family X given similarity measure Y”. However, you can list all tune families (excluding tune family X) as a partial answer.

SELECT ?tuneFamily ?label
WHERE {
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
  OPTIONAL { ?tuneFamily rdfs:label ?label . }
  FILTER(?tuneFamily != :TuneFamilyX)
}
ORDER BY ?label
