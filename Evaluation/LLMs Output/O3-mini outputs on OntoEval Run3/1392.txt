**No**

The provided ontology does not model an explicit connection between a composer and a tune family, so the CQ cannot be fully answered. However, we can partially extract tunes that are members of a tune family (ignoring the composer association, which is not modelled). Hereâ€™s a partial SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/tunes/>
PREFIX mm: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/music-meta/>
PREFIX core: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/core/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?tuneFamily ?tfLabel ?tune ?tuneLabel
WHERE {
  ?tuneFamily a :TuneFamily .
  OPTIONAL { ?tuneFamily rdfs:label ?tfLabel . }
  
  ?tuneFamily core:hasMember ?tune .
  ?tune a :Tune .
  OPTIONAL { ?tune rdfs:label ?tuneLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?tuneFamily ?tune

This query returns the tunes that are part of a tune family, but it does not filter or associate them with a composer since such a relation is not specified in the ontology under the closed world assumption.
