**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, extracts each theatre and the city in which it is located:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?theatre ?theatreName ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre :hasName ?theatreName . }
  ?theatre :locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :hasName ?cityName . }
}
ORDER BY ?theatre
-------------------------------------------------

This query uses the defined object property :locatedIn—which has domain :Cl_Theatre and range :Cl_City—to answer the competency question "In what city is a certain theatre located?"
