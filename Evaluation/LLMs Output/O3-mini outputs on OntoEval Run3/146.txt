**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closedâ€“world assumption (i.e. considering only asserted triples), retrieves each theatre and the city in which it is located:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX rdf:  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>

SELECT ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?theatre a theatre:Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel. }
  
  ?theatre theatre:locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel. }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the CQ "In what city is a certain theatre located?" by retrieving the theatre instances (with their labels, if available) together with the corresponding city (and its label) they are linked to via the theatre:locatedIn property.
