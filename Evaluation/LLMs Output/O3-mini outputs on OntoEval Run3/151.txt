**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the city in which a theatre is located:

-----------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel . }
  ?theatre :locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}
-----------------------

Under the closed world assumption, we use the property :locatedIn defined in the ontology along with the class :Cl_Theatre to answer the CQ "In what city is a certain theatre located?"
