**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves each theatre along with its name and the city (with its name) in which it is located:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?theatre ?theatreName ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre ;
           :theatreName ?theatreName ;
           :locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :cityName ?cityName . }
}
ORDER BY ?theatre

This query assumes a closed world where only the explicitly asserted instance data is available.
