Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld interpretation, retrieves for each theatre its associated city based on the ontology classes and properties (e.g. using :Cl_Theatre, :Cl_TheatreLocation, :Cl_City, and the data property :theatreName and :cityName):

SELECT ?theatre ?theatreName ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?theatre rdf:type :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :theatreName ?theatreName .
  
  ?location rdf:type :Cl_TheatreLocation .
  ?location :hasTheatre ?theatre .
  ?location :hasCity ?city .
  ?city :cityName ?cityName .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query extracts all theatres, their names, and the cities they are located in, thus answering the competency question.
