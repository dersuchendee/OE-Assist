**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the city name for a given theatre by following the “locatedIn” relationship and then reading the city name from the associated location entity:

—————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?theatre ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  ?theatre :locatedIn ?location .
  ?location :cityName ?cityName .
  
  # Optionally, if you need to restrict the query to a specific theatre, uncomment and adjust:
  # FILTER(?theatre = :YourTheatreInstance)
}
—————————————————————————————

This query shows that the competency question “In what city is a certain theatre located?” is fully supported by the ontology.
