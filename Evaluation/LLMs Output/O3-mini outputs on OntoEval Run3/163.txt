**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the city (given by the property :isLocatedInCity) where a theatre (of type :Cl_Theatre) is located:

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?city 
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel . }
  ?theatre :isLocatedInCity ?city .
}
ORDER BY ?theatre
----------------------------------

This query is answerable using the ontology because the property :isLocatedInCity is defined with domain :Cl_Theatre and range xsd:string, allowing us to extract the desired answer.
