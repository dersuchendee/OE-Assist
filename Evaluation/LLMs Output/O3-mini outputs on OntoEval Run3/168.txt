**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the country associated with a given city (for example, Rome):

PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>

SELECT ?country
WHERE {
  dbr:Rome ns1:isInCountry ?country .
}

If you need a more general query for any city (assuming the city is explicitly linked with the property ns1:isInCountry), you could use:

PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city ns1:isInCountry ?country .
}
ORDER BY ?city

These queries use the closed world assumption based on the triples in the ontology (e.g. dbr:Pisa, dbr:Venice, dbr:Rome have been asserted as being in ns1:Italy), so the competency question “In what country is a certain city located?” is fully answered by the ontology.
