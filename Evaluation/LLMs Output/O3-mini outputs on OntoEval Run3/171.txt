Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves for each city its country via the property that links a City to a Country:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
}
