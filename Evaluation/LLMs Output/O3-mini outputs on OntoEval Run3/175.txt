**Yes**

Under the closed world assumption, the ontology provides the class for cities (Cl_City), the class for countries (Cl_Country), and the property “isLocatedInCountry” whose domain is Cl_City and range is Cl_Country. This allows us to query for the country associated with a given city. Here is an example SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedInCountry ?country .
}

This query extracts, for each city, the country associated via the property :isLocatedInCountry, thereby answering the CQ "In what country is a certain city located?"
