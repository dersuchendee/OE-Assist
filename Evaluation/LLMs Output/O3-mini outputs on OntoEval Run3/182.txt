**No**

Because the ontology does not fully model the connection between a city and its country (i.e. there is no complete axiom that directly links an instance of Cl_City with an instance of Cl_Country via a reified or explicit property), we can only provide a partial extraction of city information, not the country information.

A partial SPARQL query might be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City ;
        :cityName ?cityName .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
    ?country :countryName ?countryName .
  }
}

This query will list all cities with their associated country names where such relationships are present, but under the closed world assumption the ontology lacks a full axiom linking cities to countries.
