**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves a given city’s country by following the declared object property (:locatedIn) from a city (an instance of :Cl_City) to its country, and then extracting its name via the data property (:countryName):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?city ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?country .
  ?country :countryName ?countryName .
  # Optionally restrict to a particular city (e.g., Roman "Rome") 
  # FILTER(?city = :Rome)
}  

In a closed‐world interpretation the ontology provides enough axioms (via the reification and property declarations) so that the answer to “In what country is a certain city located?” can be fully extracted using the query above.
