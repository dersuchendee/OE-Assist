**Yes**

The ontology models the CQ because it contains the class Cl_City and the datatype property isLocatedInCountry (with domain Cl_City) which allows us to extract for any given city its country. Under the closed world assumption, we assume that only explicitly stated triples exist. Thus we can answer “In what country is a certain city located?” with a query such as:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedInCountry ?country .
}
  

This query retrieves all cities along with the country in which they are located, thereby fully answering the competency question.
