**Yes**

We can answer this competency question using the reified connection between a production and the play it is based on. In the ontology, a production (instance of Cl_Production) is linked to an instance of Cl_ProductionBasedOnPlay via the object property hasBasis, and that reified instance relates to a play (instance of Cl_Play) via the property basedOn. Under a closed world assumption, this query reflects the available information.

Example SPARQL query:

SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasBasis ?prodBasedOn .
  ?prodBasedOn :basedOn ?play .
