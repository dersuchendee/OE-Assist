**Yes**

Assuming a closed world and that productions explicitly relate via the property :op_isBasedOnPlay to their basis play, the following SPARQL query can retrieve the play on which a theatre production is based:

-------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?play
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_TheatreProduction .
  ?production :op_isBasedOnPlay ?play .
}
-------------------------------------------------------------

This query returns the production(s) and the associated play(s) that serve as the basis for the production, thus fully answering the competency question.
