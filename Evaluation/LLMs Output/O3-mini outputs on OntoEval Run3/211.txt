Below is an example SPARQL query that, using the reified membership information, returns the actors (members) of a given ensemble who were members at a specified point in time. (Adjust the ensemble name and the time parameter as needed.)

SELECT DISTINCT ?actor ?actorName ?membership ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  # Specify the ensemble of interest (change "Your Ensemble Name Here" as needed)
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble ;
            :hasName "Your Ensemble Name Here" .

  # Retrieve the membership instance associated with the ensemble
  ?ensemble :ensembleHasMembership ?membership .

  # Membership time interval
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
  ?membership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate .

  # Use the closed world assumption: Filter memberships active at the given time
  FILTER ("2009-09-15"^^xsd:date >= ?membershipStartDate && "2009-09-15"^^xsd:date <= ?membershipEndDate)

  # Get the member (actor) indicated in the membership reification
  ?membership :member ?actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor :hasName ?actorName . }
}

This query leverages the reified membership (using :Cl_EnsembleMembership and related properties) to answer the competency question "Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?"
