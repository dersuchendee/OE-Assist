**No**

The ontology does not represent a temporal dimension for ensemble membership. Although we can extract the members of a given ensemble, no property specifies when a member is part of an ensemble (or when that membership is active). Hence, the CQ “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” is only partially answerable from the ontology.

A SPARQL query to extract the static membership (i.e. the ensemble members without considering time) is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/theatre_ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?ensembleLabel ?member ?memberName
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Ensemble .
  OPTIONAL { ?ensemble rdfs:label ?ensembleLabel . }
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?member .
  OPTIONAL { ?member :hasName ?memberName . }
}

--------------------------------------------------

Because the ontology does not include any temporal properties for ensemble membership, the time aspect of the CQ is not fully supported.
