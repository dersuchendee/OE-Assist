**Yes**

Below is one example query that uses the ensemble‐membership reification (with its membership start and end dates) to return, for a given ensemble and time point, all the actors who were members at that time. In this query the ensemble identifier is provided as a parameter (here shown as :TARGET_Ensemble) and the time point is defined via the variable ?timePoint (for example “2009-09-07”^^xsd:date):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?member ?memberName
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership ;
              :membershipOf :TARGET_Ensemble ;    # the given ensemble
              :member ?member ;
              :membershipStartDate ?start .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?end . }
  ?member :hasName ?memberName .
  
  # Replace "2009-09-07" with the desired point in time
  BIND(xsd:date("2009-09-07") AS ?timePoint)
  
  FILTER (?timePoint >= ?start && ( !BOUND(?end) || ?timePoint <= ?end ))
}

This query returns the members (?member and its name) who are associated via an ensemble membership with :TARGET_Ensemble at the specified point in time.
