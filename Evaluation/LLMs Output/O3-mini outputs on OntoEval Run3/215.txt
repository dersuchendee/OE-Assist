**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that returns the members (actors) of each ensemble at the specific time associated with that ensemble. (A production system may require filtering by a given ensemble or time point; here we assume that ensembles are reified as instances of theatre:EnsembleAtTime that carry a theatre:hasMember property and an associated time via theatre:atTime.)

  # If you want to select one specific ensemble at a certain time, you could add a FILTER:
  # FILTER(?ensemble = <http://.../YourEnsembleURI> && ?time = "2007-01-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
ORDER BY ?ensemble ?time

This query leverages the reified ensemble concept (here realized as theatre:EnsembleAtTime) to answer “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” under the closed world assumption.
