**Yes**

The ontology includes a reified membership class (Cl_Membership) that links an ensemble (Cl_Ensemble) with its members (Cl_Member) at a given time (Cl_Time) using the properties :ensembleInMembership, :memberInMembership, and :atTime. Under the closed world assumption, we assume that only the explicitly asserted facts are true. That makes it possible to query for the members that belong to a given ensemble at a specific time.

For example, hereâ€™s a SPARQL query where you need to supply the ensemble identifier (e.g., :SomeEnsemble) and a given time (e.g., "2009-09-15"^^xsd:date):

SELECT ?member ?memberLabel
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership ;
              :ensembleInMembership :SomeEnsemble ;
              :atTime ?time ;
              :memberInMembership ?member .
  FILTER ( ?time = "2009-09-15"^^xsd:date )
  
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
}

This query extracts all the members associated with the specified ensemble at the given time, thereby answering the competency question.
