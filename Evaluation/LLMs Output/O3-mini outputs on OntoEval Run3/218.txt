**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, given an ensemble (here represented as ?ensemble) and a specific time (specified as a literal ?timePoint), retrieves the actors who were members of that ensemble at that time. The query leverages the reified membership class (Cl_EnsembleMembership) and its properties for membership start and end dates.

Note: Replace <TARGET_ENSEMBLE_IRI> with the actual ensemble IRI and "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" with the desired dateTime value.

This query answers the CQ “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” based on the ontology provided.
