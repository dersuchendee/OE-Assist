**Yes**

Here’s a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves ensembles along with their members for a specified point in time. (In this example, the date is provided as a filter value—you can adjust it as needed.)

SELECT ?ensemble ?ensembleLabel ?member ?memberLabel ?date
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble ;
            :hasMember ?member ;
            :date ?date .
  OPTIONAL { ?ensemble rdfs:label ?ensembleLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
  FILTER(?date = "2009-09-07"^^xsd:date) 
}

This query answers the CQ “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” by finding ensembles with a given date and returning their members.
