**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, using the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the members of a given ensemble that are valid at a given point in time (here provided as a parameter). In this example, we assume that each membership is reified as an instance of Cl_Member with a known membership start date via the property :hasMembershipDate. (If no end date is provided, we assume that a membership remains in effect from its start date unless stated otherwise.) 

For instance, if you want to know the members of ensemble “:ensembleXYZ” that have joined on or before a specified date (e.g. “2009-09-15”), you could run:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?member ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  :ensembleXYZ a :Cl_Ensemble .
  :ensembleXYZ :hasMember ?member .
  ?member :hasMembershipDate ?membershipDate .
  FILTER(?membershipDate <= "2009-09-15"^^xsd:date)
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query is answerable from the ontology because there is a direct connection between ensembles and their members using the reified membership (via :hasMember and :hasMembershipDate), and so the CQ is modelled by the ontology.
