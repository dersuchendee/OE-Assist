**Yes**

One can answer this CQ using the ontology. The ontology models ensembles (class Cl_Ensemble), individuals (Cl_Individual) and ensemble memberships (Cl_EnsembleMembership) with a time stamp (property :atTime). Given a particular ensemble and a particular point in time, you can write a SPARQL query that returns the individuals who are members at that time. For example, if you want to know the members of the ensemble :MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble at a given time (say, "2009-09-01T00:00:00Z"), the query would be:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?individual ?name ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  # Here we specify a particular ensemble; this can be parameterized as needed.
  VALUES ?ensemble { :MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble }
  
  # Get individuals known to be members of this ensemble
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?individual .
  
  # Retrieve the membership record that connects the individual to the ensemble
  ?individual :hasEnsembleMembership ?membership .
  
  # Get the timestamp at which the membership holds
  ?membership :atTime ?membershipTime .
  
  # Assuming we want the membership that exactly matches the given point in time.
  FILTER(?membershipTime = "2009-09-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime)
  
  OPTIONAL { ?individual :hasName ?name . }
}
ORDER BY ?individual
-------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves for a given ensemble the individuals whose membership time matches the provided time, thereby directly answering the competency question.
