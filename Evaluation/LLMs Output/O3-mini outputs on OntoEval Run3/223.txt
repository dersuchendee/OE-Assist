**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, given an ensemble and a specific time, returns the actors whose membership period covers the given time:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?actor ?actorLabel ?dp_startDate ?dp_endDate
WHERE {
  # Bind the ensemble of interest (adjust the URI as needed)
  BIND(:MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble AS ?ensemble)
  
  # Bind the specific point in time (adjust the date as needed)
  BIND("2009-09-15"^^xsd:date AS ?givenTime)
  
  # Find the membership record for the ensemble
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership ;
              :op_membershipIn ?ensemble ;
              :dp_startDate ?dp_startDate ;
              :dp_endDate ?dp_endDate .
  
  # Check that the given time falls within the membership period 
  FILTER(?givenTime >= ?dp_startDate && ?givenTime <= ?dp_endDate)
  
  # Get the actor associated with that membership
  ?actor :op_hasMembership ?membership .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query uses the closed-world assumption by explicitly filtering on the membership start and end dates to determine whether an actor is a member of the given ensemble at the specified point in time.
