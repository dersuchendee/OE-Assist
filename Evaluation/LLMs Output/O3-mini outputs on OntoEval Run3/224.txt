**Yes**

The ontology provides classes and properties – notably the reified membership class (:Cl_EnsembleMembership) with its property :atTime, along with the links between actors (:Cl_Actor) and ensembles (via :performedIn and the membership relation :memberOf) – so that one may retrieve, for a given ensemble and a given time, the actors who are members at that time. For instance, one can write a SPARQL query like the following (using a given ensemble IRI and a fixed time value as parameters):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  # Select the target ensemble (replace with the ensemble of interest)
  VALUES ?ensemble { :MerchantOfVeniceEnsemble }
  
  # Get actors that performed in the target ensemble
  ?actor :performedIn ?ensemble .
  
  # Get the membership instance (reified membership) for the actor
  ?actor :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :atTime ?membershipTime .
  
  # Optionally attach a human‐readable label
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
  
  # Filter by a specific time: replace the literal below with the desired point in time
  FILTER(?membershipTime = "2009-09-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
ORDER BY ?actor

In a closed‐world setting (i.e. assuming that only the stated facts hold), this query returns the actors who are members of the given ensemble at the specific point in time.
