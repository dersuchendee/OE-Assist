**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the members of a given ensemble (here, for example, the ensemble “Ensemble_GrandTheatre_MerchantOfVenice”) whose membership is active at a provided point in time. In this query we assume that the input time is provided as a literal (e.g. "2009-09-10"^^xsd:date) and we use the closed‐world assumption (i.e. if a membershipEndDate is not given then that membership is assumed to be still in force):

SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel
WHERE {
  VALUES ?ensemble { :Ensemble_GrandTheatre_MerchantOfVenice }  
  ?ensemble :hasEnsembleMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :memberActor ?actor .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?start .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?end . }
  
  # The given point in time (adjust the literal as needed)
  BIND("2009-09-10"^^xsd:date AS ?pointTime)
  
  FILTER (
    ?pointTime >= ?start &&
    ( !bound(?end) || ?pointTime <= ?end )
  )
  
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}

This query confirms that the CQ “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” is answerable using the ontology.
