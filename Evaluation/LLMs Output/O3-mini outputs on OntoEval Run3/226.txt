**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the members (actors) for a given ensemble and time period—using the reified membership structure provided by the ontology:

———————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?actorName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble ;
            :hasEnsembleMembership ?membership .
  
  ?membership :hasTimePeriod ?tp ;
              :hasMember ?member .
  
  ?tp :timePeriod ?timePeriod .
  ?member :actorName ?actorName .
  
  # Adjust the following FILTERs to specify a particular ensemble and time period:
  FILTER(?ensemble = :Ensemble_GrandTheatre_MerchantOfVenice && ?timePeriod = "September 2009")
}
ORDER BY ?member
———————————————————————————————

This query shows that the ontology models ensemble memberships as reified entities (of type Cl_EnsembleMembership) linking ensembles, actors, and time periods. Hence, the CQ is answerable via the ontology under the closed world assumption.
