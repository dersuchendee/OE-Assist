**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, returns the actors (members) of a chosen ensemble at a specific date. (Replace <targetEnsembleURI> with the URI of the ensemble of interest and “YYYY‐MM‐DD” with the desired date.)

SELECT ?ensemble ?membership ?actorName ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership a :Cl_EnsembleMembership ;
              :actorName ?actorName ;
              :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
  
  # Restrict to a specific ensemble and a given membership date (the “point in time”)
  FILTER(?ensemble = <targetEnsembleURI>)
  FILTER(?membershipDate = "YYYY-MM-DD"^^xsd:date)
}

This query shows that the ontology models the competency question “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” by retrieving, for a given ensemble, the actor names (via the reified membership instances) whose membership date matches the specified date.
