**No**

The ontology only records ensemble membership via the property :hasMember and does not tie the membership directly to a specific time. Although there is time information in the ontology (through roles with the property :roleAtTime), this time stamp is attached to a person’s role (via :hasRole and :roleAtTime) in a production—not directly to the ensemble membership. Under a closed‐world assumption the ontology does not support the full temporal aspect of “membership at a certain point in time.” Therefore, we can only partially answer the CQ (by listing ensemble members regardless of time, and optionally including any role instance with time, if available).

A partial SPARQL query is given below:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?ensemble ?member ?roleTime
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble.
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?member.
  
  OPTIONAL {
    ?member :hasRole ?role.
    ?role :roleAtTime ?roleTime.
    FILTER(?roleTime = "2009-09-15"^^xsd:date)  # Example specific date
  }
  # You can filter for a specific ensemble if desired:
  # FILTER(?ensemble = <http://www.example.org/test#Ensemble_X>)
}
---------------------------------

This query returns the members of each ensemble along with any role-based date information (if available) that might match the given point in time.
