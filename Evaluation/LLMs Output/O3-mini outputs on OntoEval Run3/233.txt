**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, returns the member names (and their membership dates) for a given ensemble at a specified date. You can replace the example date (here "2007-01-15") and ensemble IRI as needed.

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?memberName ?membershipDate
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Cl_Ensemble .
  ?ensemble :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership :memberName ?memberName .
  ?membership :membershipDate ?membershipDate .
  FILTER(?membershipDate = "2007-01-15"^^xsd:date)
}
-------------------------------------------------

In this query the ontology’s reified class :Cl_EnsembleMembership (associated via the property :hasMember with domain :Cl_Ensemble) captures both the person (via the data property :memberName) and the time (via :membershipDate). Thus the competency question “Who are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time?” is answerable.
