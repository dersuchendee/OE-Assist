**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the plays written by a given author (for example, William Shakespeare):

----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

# Replace <the_author_IRI> with the IRI of the author of interest.
SELECT ?author ?authorLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a theatre:Author ;
          rdfs:label ?authorLabel ;
          theatre:wrote ?play .
  ?play a theatre:Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  
  # For a specific author, e.g., William Shakespeare, you could use:
  # FILTER(?author = theatre:WilliamShakespeare)
}
----------------------------------------------------

This query leverages the ontologyâ€™s modeling of authors and plays with the properties theatre:wrote (and its inverse theatre:writtenBy) to extract the answer to the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" under the closed world assumption.
