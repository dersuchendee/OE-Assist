**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that, given an author (to be supplied as a parameter), retrieves the plays that the author wrote via the writing events:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?writingEvent a :Cl_WritingEvent ;
                :hasAuthor ?author ;
                :hasPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  FILTER (?author = <http://www.example.org/test#William_Shakespeare>)
}

This query is answerable under the closed world assumption since the ontology reifies the authorâ€“play relationship through a writing event, making it possible to extract the plays by a specified author.
