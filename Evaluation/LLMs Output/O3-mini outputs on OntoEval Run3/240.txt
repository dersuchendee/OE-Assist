**Yes**

Assuming you have an individual (e.g., :SomeAuthor) representing the “certain author”, you can extract the plays written by that author with the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?title
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  ?play :hasAuthor :SomeAuthor .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasTitle ?title . }
}

Under the closed world assumption, if the ontology includes the fact that a play is related to an author by the property :hasAuthor (or its inverse :authorOf), then this query will return all the plays that the given author wrote.
