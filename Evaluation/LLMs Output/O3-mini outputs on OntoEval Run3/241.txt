Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, returns for a given author (here assumed to be an instance of Cl_Playwright, a subclass of Cl_Author) the plays they wrote using the property wrotePlay:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?author ?play ?playName
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Playwright .
  ?author :wrotePlay ?play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
}
ORDER BY ?author ?playName
