**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given author, the plays they have written by following the reified relationship between an author and their authored play via the "hasWritten" and "hasWrittenPlay" properties:

------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?author ?authorLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorLabel. }

  ?author :hasWritten ?authorship .
  ?authorship :hasWrittenPlay ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?author ?play
------------------------------------------------------ 

This query assumes the closed world, meaning that if an authorâ€™s "hasWritten" relationship is missing, then no play is produced in the result set.
