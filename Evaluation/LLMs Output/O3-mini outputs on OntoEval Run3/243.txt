**Yes**

Assuming that a “certain author” is provided (or bound to a given URI), you could answer the CQ with a query like:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?author ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  ?author :wrote ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  FILTER(?author = :SpecificAuthor)  # Replace :SpecificAuthor with the desired author’s URI
}

This query extracts all plays written by the specified author, and so the CQ is modeled by the ontology.
