**Yes**

We can answer the competency question since the ontology contains the class for authors (Cl_Author) and a property (:hasWritten) that links an author to a play (Cl_Play).

For example, the following SPARQL query returns the plays written by a given author (here represented as ?author, which you could bind to a specific individual):

-----------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?author ?authorLabel ?play ?playLabel
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  ?author :hasWritten ?play .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?author
-----------------

Using our closed world assumption, only those triples explicitly stated in the ontology will be retrieved as the answer.
