**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that returns the plays written by authors. In this query, you can filter for a specific author if needed (for example, by matching the authorâ€™s name):

-------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?authorName ?play ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author ;
          :hasName ?authorName ;
          :wrotePlay ?play .
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :hasTitle ?playTitle .
  
  # Optionally, filter to a specific author (e.g., William Shakespeare)
  # FILTER(?authorName = "William Shakespeare")
}
-------------------------------------------

This query extracts the plays (and their titles) written by each author, thereby answering the competency question "What plays did a certain author write?" under the closed-world assumption of the ontology.
