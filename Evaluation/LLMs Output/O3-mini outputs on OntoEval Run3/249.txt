**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves an authorâ€™s name along with the names of the plays they wrote:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?authorName ?playName
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author ;
          :authorName ?authorName ;
          :wrotePlay ?play .
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question by extracting the plays (and their names) written by each author in the ontology.
