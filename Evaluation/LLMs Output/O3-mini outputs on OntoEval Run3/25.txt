**No**

There is no explicit modelling in the ontology that connects a specific product (or product instance) with a manufacturer. One could only partially retrieve manufacturer‐related information by, for example, listing products produced through a manufacturing process where an actor with a “manufacturer” role participated. A partial SPARQL query attempting this is shown below:

PREFIX actor: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actor/>
PREFIX actorODP: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/actorODP/>
PREFIX process: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/process/>
PREFIX product: <http://w3id.org/CEON/ontology/product/>

SELECT ?product ?productLabel ?manufacturingProcess ?manufacturer ?manuLabel
WHERE {
  ?product a product:Product.
  OPTIONAL { ?product rdfs:label ?productLabel. }
  
  ?manufacturingProcess a process:ManufacturingProcess.
  ?manufacturingProcess process:resultingProduct ?product.
  
  ?participation actorODP:participationIn ?manufacturingProcess;
                 actorODP:participatingActor ?manufacturer.
  OPTIONAL { ?manufacturer rdfs:label ?manuLabel. }
  
  # Partial filter: if an actor is known as the manufacturer individual
  FILTER(?manufacturer = actor:manufacturer)
}

This query only partially answers the CQ because the ontology does not fully reify or directly connect products with their manufacturers.
