**Yes**

Assuming the “certain author” can be identified via the ontology’s class :Cl_Author and the connection through :hasWritten to the pivot class :Cl_Authorship (which relates both an author and the play they wrote via the data property :playTitle), you can extract the plays written by authors. Here’s a SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, returns for each author the titles of plays they have written:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?author ?authorLabel ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author .
  OPTIONAL { ?author rdfs:label ?authorLabel . }
  ?author :hasWritten ?authorship .
  ?authorship :playTitle ?playTitle .
}

This query will list all authors along with the plays (their titles) that they wrote.
