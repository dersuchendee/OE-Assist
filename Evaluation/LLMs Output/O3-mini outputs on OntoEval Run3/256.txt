The following SPARQL query returns the plays written by a specified author. In this ontology the author is linked through a reified Authorship (a subclass of both Cl_Author and Cl_Play) via the property :hasWritten. Adjust the FILTER condition with the appropriate author identifier or label as needed.

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?author ?playTitle
WHERE {
  ?author a :Cl_Author ;
          :hasWritten ?authorship .
  ?authorship :playTitle ?playTitle .
  # Optionally, if authors have labels, you can filter by a given author name:
  # ?author rdfs:label ?authorLabel .
  # FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?authorLabel), "shakespeare")) 
}
