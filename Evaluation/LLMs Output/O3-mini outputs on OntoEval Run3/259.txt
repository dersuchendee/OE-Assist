**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves a play along with its writing period (start and end years):

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playTitle ?startYear ?endYear
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :dp_title ?playTitle . }
  ?play :op_hasWritingPeriod ?writingPeriod .
  ?writingPeriod :dp_startYear ?startYear .
  ?writingPeriod :dp_endYear ?endYear .
}
-------------------------------------------------

In this query the ontology connects a Cl_Play to its writing period via the reified property :op_hasWritingPeriod (with associated data properties :dp_startYear and :dp_endYear). Under the closed world assumption, only plays with an explicitly asserted writing period are returned.
