**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, using the closed world assumption, extracts the time period in which a given play (in this case “The Merchant of Venice”) was written:

PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?play a theatre:Play ;
        rdfs:label ?playLabel ;
        theatre:hasTimePeriod ?tp .
  ?tp theatre:hasStartDate ?startDate ;
      theatre:hasEndDate ?endDate .
  
  FILTER(?playLabel = "The Merchant of Venice")
}
