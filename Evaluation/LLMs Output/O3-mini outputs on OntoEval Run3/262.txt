**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the writing event (and its start and end dates) for a given play (for instance, “The Merchant of Venice”):

-------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :hasWritingEvent ?writingEvent .
  ?writingEvent :hasStartDate ?startDate ;
                :hasEndDate   ?endDate .
  # Optionally, filter for a specific play identified by its URI
  FILTER(?play = <http://www.example.org/test#TheMerchantOfVenice>)
}
-------------------------------------------------------

This query works under the closed world assumption by only returning plays that explicitly have a linked writing event with defined start and end dates.
