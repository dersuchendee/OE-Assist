**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each play, its writing period defined by the associated TimeInterval (using its start and end dates):

SELECT ?play ?title ?start ?end
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasTitle ?title . }
  ?play :wasWrittenDuring ?time .
  ?time :hasStartDate ?start .
  ?time :hasEndDate ?end .
}
ORDER BY ?title

In a closed-world view, if a play lacks an associated writing period (i.e. the property :wasWrittenDuring), it is assumed that no such information exists. This query shows that the competency question “During what time period was a certain play written?” is answerable using the given ontology.
