**Yes**

We can answer this CQ using the presence of the property :hasWritingPeriod (whose domain is :Cl_Play) to extract the writing period information of a play. Under the closed world assumption, if a play does not have this property explicitly stated, then no writing period is assumed.

A SPARQL query to answer the question is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?writingPeriod
WHERE {
  ?play rdf:type :Cl_Play .
  ?play :hasWritingPeriod ?writingPeriod .
}

This query retrieves each play and its corresponding writing period, thereby modeling the CQ "During what time period was a certain play written?" in the given ontology.
