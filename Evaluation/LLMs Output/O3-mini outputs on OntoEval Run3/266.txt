**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that answers the question by returning, for a given play (e.g., “The Merchant of Venice”), the time period during which it was written:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?writtenPeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :writtenDuring ?writtenPeriod .
  # Optionally restrict to a specific play (e.g., The Merchant of Venice)
  FILTER(regex(str(?play), "Merchant", "i"))
}

This query extracts the play along with its associated value for the property “writtenDuring” using the closed world assumption.
