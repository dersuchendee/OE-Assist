**Yes**

Below is a sample SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given play, the time period during which it was written (using the property :hasWritingPeriod of :Cl_Play):

----------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?writingPeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  ?play :hasWritingPeriod ?writingPeriod .
  # Optionally, filter for a specific play (e.g., Merchant of Venice)
  # FILTER(?play = :TheMerchantOfVenice)
}
----------------

This query extracts the play and its writing period. In the closed-world assumption, if a play does not have a recorded writing period, it will not appear in the result set.
