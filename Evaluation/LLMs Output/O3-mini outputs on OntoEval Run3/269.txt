**Yes**

Assuming that “a certain play” is represented as an instance of Cl_Play that has its writing time period described via the data properties dp_writtenStartDate and dp_writtenEndDate, the following SPARQL query retrieves the play along with its writing period. (Under the closed world assumption, only plays that explicitly state these dates will be returned.)

SELECT ?play ?writtenStartDate ?writtenEndDate
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :dp_writtenStartDate ?writtenStartDate ;
        :dp_writtenEndDate ?writtenEndDate .
}
ORDER BY ?play

This query shows that the ontology models the CQ “During what time period was a certain play written?” by providing explicit written start and end dates for plays.
