**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves, for each play, its writing period (start and end dates) assuming a closed world view of the ontology:

---------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?writingStartDate ?writingEndDate
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :hasWritingPeriod ?wp .
  ?wp :writingStartDate ?writingStartDate ;
      :writingEndDate ?writingEndDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?play
---------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology indeed models the competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" since it provides access to the writing period associated with a play.
