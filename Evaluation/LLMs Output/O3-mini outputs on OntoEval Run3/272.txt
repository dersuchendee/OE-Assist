Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves for each play its name and the time period during which it was written, based on the property “writtenDuring” defined in the ontology:

SELECT ?play ?playName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
  ?play :writtenDuring ?timePeriodResource .
  ?timePeriodResource :timePeriod ?timePeriod .
}
ORDER BY ?playName
