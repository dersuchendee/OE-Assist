**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for a given play (here “The Merchant of Venice”) the minimum and maximum dates recorded on its associated play time period – which represents the period during which it was written:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?playName (MIN(?date) AS ?startDate) (MAX(?date) AS ?endDate)
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName .
  FILTER(?playName = "The Merchant of Venice")
  
  ?playTimePeriod a :Cl_PlayTimePeriod ;
                  :hasPlay ?play ;
                  :hasTimePeriod ?datePeriod .
  ?datePeriod :festivalDate ?date .
}
GROUP BY ?playName
-------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the writing time period for the play by grouping the available dates and returning the earliest and latest dates as the start and end of the period.
