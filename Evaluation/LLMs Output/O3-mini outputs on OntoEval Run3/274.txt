**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the time period (via the associated play‐creation period) for a particular play (here “The Merchant of Venice”) from an ontology that uses reification for plays:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?playName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName ;
        :writtenDuring ?playCreation .
  ?playCreation :timePeriod ?timePeriod .
  FILTER(?playName = "The Merchant of Venice")
}

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports answering the competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" under the closed world assumption.
