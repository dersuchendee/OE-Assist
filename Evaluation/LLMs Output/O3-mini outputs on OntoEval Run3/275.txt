Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the time period during which a given play was written, using the reified connection (via the :writtenDuring property) from a play to its associated play-written period (whose time period is given by the :timePeriod data property):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?play ?playName ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
  ?play :writtenDuring ?period .
  ?period :timePeriod ?timePeriod .
}

This query answers the competency question "During what time period was a certain play written?" by selecting plays (optionally filtering by a specific play name when needed) and retrieving the associated time period information.
