**Yes**  
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the play(s) along with the “writtenDuring” information:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?writtenDuring
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :writtenDuring ?writtenDuring .
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this ontology the property “:writtenDuring” (with range xsd:string) models the time period during which a play was written. Under the closed world assumption, the query returns the answer if the play’s written time period is specified in the ontology.
