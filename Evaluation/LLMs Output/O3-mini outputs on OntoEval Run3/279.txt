The ontology contains a reification class (Cl_PlayCreation) linked to plays by the property wasWrittenDuring and provides the data property creationPeriod. In other words, for a given play (an instance of Cl_Play), you can retrieve the time period in which it was written using these properties. Under a closed world assumption, this enables writing a SPARQL query that returns the creation period for a play.

For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?title ?creationPeriod
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :wasWrittenDuring ?playCreation .
  ?playCreation :creationPeriod ?creationPeriod .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playTitle ?title. }
}

This query retrieves each play along with its title and the time period during which it was written.
