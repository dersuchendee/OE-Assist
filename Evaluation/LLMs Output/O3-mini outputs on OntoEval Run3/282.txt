Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the number of acts for a given play (for instance, “The Merchant of Venice”). In this ontology the play is connected through a reified class (Cl_PlayActInformation) via the property :hasActInformation, and the act count is recorded using the data property :actCount.

SELECT ?play ?actCount
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :hasActInformation ?actInfo .
  ?actInfo :actCount ?actCount .
  # For a specific play, e.g., The Merchant of Venice:
  FILTER(?play = :TheMerchantOfVenice)
}

This query fully addresses the competency question “How many acts does a particular play contain?” by extracting the act count associated with the reified information for the play.
