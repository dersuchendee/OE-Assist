**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the number of acts for a particular play (e.g., "The Merchant of Venice") from the ontology:

PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a theatre:Play ;
        rdfs:label "The Merchant of Venice" ;
        theatre:hasNumberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
}
