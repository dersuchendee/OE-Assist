**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the number of acts for a given play (here parameterised using its label, e.g., "The Merchant of Venice"):

----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?play ?numActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        rdfs:label "The Merchant of Venice" ;
        :numberOfActs ?numActs .
}
----------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology provides the :numberOfActs property for instances of :Cl_Play, therefore supporting the competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" under the closed world assumption.
