**Yes**

Assuming that a play’s acts are related via the property (for example, via :hasAct), the following SPARQL query returns, for a given play (or for all plays), the number of acts it contains under a closed‐world assumption:

--------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play (COUNT(?act) AS ?numberOfActs)
WHERE {
  ?play a :Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :hasAct ?act . }
  # (If you want a specific play, you can add a FILTER below)
  # FILTER(?play = :MerchantOfVenice)
}
GROUP BY ?play
--------------------------------------

This query counts the instances of acts linked to each play, which, under the closed-world assumption, provides the complete number of acts for each play.
