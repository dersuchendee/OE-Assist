**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, given a specific play (for example, "The Merchant of Venice"), extracts the number of acts recorded by the ontology:

----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?numActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  ?play :containsActs ?numActs .
  FILTER (regex(lcase(str(?playLabel)), "merchant of venice"))
}
----------------------------------------------------

In a closed world setting, we assume that only those plays with an explicitly stated :containsActs value have that information recorded. This query answers the competency question by retrieving how many acts the specified play contains.
