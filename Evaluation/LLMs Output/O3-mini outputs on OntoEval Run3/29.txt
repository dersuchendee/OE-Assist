**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves each actor’s assigned roles according to the ontology:

-------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/construction#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorLabel ?role ?roleLabel
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Actor ;
         :hasRole ?role .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel . }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “What are the roles of this actor in this network?” by extracting actors (from :Actor) and their roles (via the :hasRole property) from the ontology under the closed world assumption.
