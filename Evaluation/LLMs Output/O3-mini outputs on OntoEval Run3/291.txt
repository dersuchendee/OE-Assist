**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the number of acts for a specific play (for example, “The Merchant of Venice”) using the :containsActs property defined for :Cl_Play:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?title ?acts
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :hasTitle ?title ;
        :containsActs ?acts .
  FILTER(?title = "The Merchant of Venice")
}

This query answers the competency question by directly extracting the act count from the ontology under the closed world assumption.
