**Yes**

Below is a sample SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the number of acts for "The Merchant of Venice" (or any play of interest by filtering on its label):

--------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel (COUNT(?act) AS ?numActs)
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        rdfs:label ?playLabel ;
        :hasAct ?act .
  FILTER(?playLabel = "The Merchant of Venice") 
}
GROUP BY ?play ?playLabel
--------------------------------------------------------------

This query counts the number of :Cl_PlayAct individuals connected to the play, thereby answering the competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?"
