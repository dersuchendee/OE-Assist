**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves for each play its name and the number of acts (via the reified Cl_PlayActs information) from the ontology:

-------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playName ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play ;
        :playName ?playName .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?playActs a :Cl_PlayActs ;
              :hasPlay ?play ;
              :hasNumberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
  }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “How many acts does a particular play contain?” by extracting the play’s name and its associated number of acts as modelled in the ontology under :Cl_PlayActs with the property :hasNumberOfActs.
