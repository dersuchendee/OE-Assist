**Yes**

Assuming that each play is modelled as an instance of :Cl_Play which is linked via the object property :containsActs to an instance of :Cl_PlayActs having a data property :numberOfActs that records the number of acts, we can answer the CQ “How many acts does a particular play contain?” under the closed‐world assumption. For example, to get the number of acts for the play “The Merchant of Venice,” one can use the following SPARQL query:

-----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?playName ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  ?play :playName ?playName .
  ?play :containsActs ?act .
  ?act :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
  FILTER(?playName = "The Merchant of Venice")
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the name of a particular play (in this case “The Merchant of Venice”) and the associated number of acts as stored in the ontology.
