**Yes**

Assuming that each play (modeled as an instance of the class :Cl_Play or its reification subclass :Cl_FestivalPlays) is linked to its acts via the object property :containsActs (whose range is :Cl_PlayActs) and that each act instance has the data property :numberOfActs, the following SPARQL query shows how to retrieve, for a given play, the number of acts it contains. (Replace the FILTER value with the URI or condition identifying the particular play of interest.)

SELECT ?play ?playName ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play :playName ?playName . }
  ?play :containsActs ?act .
  ?act :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
  
  # For a particular play, you can restrict by its URI or name, for example:
  # FILTER (?play = <http://www.example.org/test#TheMerchantOfVenice>)
}

With this query you can extract the answer to the competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?" under a closed world assumption.
