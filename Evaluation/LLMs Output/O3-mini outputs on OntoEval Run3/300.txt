**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves for any play the (integer) number of acts it contains. (You can add a FILTER if you wish to restrict the answer to a particular play.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playLabel ?numActs
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_Play .
  OPTIONAL { ?play rdfs:label ?playLabel . }
  ?play :numActs ?numActs .
}
ORDER BY ?play

This query shows that the ontology models the required information (the number of acts for each play) to answer the competency question "How many acts does a particular play contain?"
