**Yes**

Assuming that each play is represented as an instance of :Cl_Play and that its number of acts is recorded by the data property :numberOfActs, the following SPARQL query shows how to retrieve the number of acts for a given play (here using a filter to select a particular play, e.g. one whose identifier contains “MerchantOfVenice”):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?play ?numberOfActs
WHERE {
  ?play rdf:type :Cl_Play .
  ?play :numberOfActs ?numberOfActs .
  FILTER (regex(str(?play), "MerchantOfVenice", "i"))
}

In a closed-world assumption scenario, it is assumed that if a play exists in the ontology it explicitly has the :numberOfActs property. Therefore, the CQ is fully answerable using the ontology.
