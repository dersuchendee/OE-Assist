**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given play (e.g. “The Merchant of Venice”), its title and number of acts recorded via the reified play structure.

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?play ?playTitle ?acts
WHERE {
  ?play a :Cl_PlayStructure ;
        :numberOfActs ?acts ;
        :playTitle ?playTitle .
  FILTER(?playTitle = "The Merchant of Venice")
}
---------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology explicitly models play structures (through the reification class :Cl_PlayStructure) with the data property :numberOfActs, which makes the competency question answerable under a closed world assumption.
