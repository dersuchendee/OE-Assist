**Yes**

Assuming the ontology uses the property :hasPremiereDate (with range xsd:date) to record the premiere date for a theatre production, the following SPARQL query answers the competency question under the closed‐world assumption:

PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?production ?premiereDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :TheatreProduction .
  ?production :hasPremiereDate ?premiereDate .
}
ORDER BY ?production

This query retrieves each theatre production along with its premiere date, thereby answering the CQ “When was the premier of a certain production?”
