**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves productions (modeled as Cl_ProductionPremier) together with their premier dates:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_ProductionPremier .
  ?production :hasPremierDate ?premierDate .
}
ORDER BY ?production

This query shows that the ontology provides a reified connection between a production (specifically those that are premier productions) and their premier date via the property hasPremierDate, allowing us to answer the competency question under a closed world assumption.
