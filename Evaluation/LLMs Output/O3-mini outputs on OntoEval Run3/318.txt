**Yes**

The production’s premier is modelled via the relationship between a production (instance of Cl_Production) and its premier (instance of Cl_ProductionPremier), with the premier date captured by the data property (premierDateValue) on an instance of Cl_PremierDate. For example, the production “The Merchant of Venice at The Grand Theatre” has a premier represented by the resource Premier_GrandTheatre_MerchantOfVenice_Sept7 whose premierDateValue is "2009-09-07". Under the closed world assumption, we can assume that any production with a premier must have that association explicitly modeled.

A SPARQL query to answer the CQ “When was the premier of a certain production?” is as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionName ?premierDateValue
WHERE {
  ?production rdf:type :Cl_Production ;
              :productionName ?productionName ;
              :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDateResource .
  ?premierDateResource :premierDateValue ?premierDateValue .
  # Filter to a specific production if needed – remove/comment the filter for all
  FILTER(?productionName = "The Merchant of Venice at The Grand Theatre")
}
-------------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the production’s name and its premier date, thereby fully supporting the CQ.
