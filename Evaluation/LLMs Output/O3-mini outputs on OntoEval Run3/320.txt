Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves productions along with the premier date (assuming that productions have a premier reification through the property :hasPremier and that the premier date is stored via the data property :premierDate):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premierOccurrence .
  ?premierOccurrence :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “When was the premier of a certain production?” by extracting, for each production in the ontology, the associated premier’s date.
