**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, would answer the CQ by retrieving the star rating given by a specific newspaper (e.g. “Il Gazzettino”) for a specified production:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?review ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :TheatreProduction ;
              :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :reviewedBy ?newspaper ;
          :hasStarRating ?starRating .
  # Replace the IRI below with the actual URI for the target newspaper
  FILTER (?newspaper = <http://example.org/theatreontology#IlGazzettino>)
  # Optionally, you could filter by production if needed:
  # FILTER (?production = <http://example.org/theatreontology#YourProductionURI>)
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query, we assume that the ontology provides the classes and properties (e.g. :TheatreProduction, :Review, :hasReview, :reviewedBy, and :hasStarRating) needed to answer the CQ.
