**Yes**

Assuming you know which production and which newspaper you are interested in (i.e. using specific URIs or filtering by labels), the following query extracts the star rating value by linking a review to its production and the newspaper that gave the rating via the properties defined in the ontology:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?ratingValue
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_Review ;
          :givenBy ?newspaper ;
          :forProduction ?production ;
          :hasStarRating ?starRating .
  ?starRating :hasStarRatingValue ?ratingValue .
  # Apply filters for the specific production and newspaper if needed:
  FILTER(?production = :SpecificProductionURI && ?newspaper = :SpecificNewspaperURI)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the CQ "What is the 'star rating' given by a certain newspaper for a certain production?" is answerable by the ontology.
