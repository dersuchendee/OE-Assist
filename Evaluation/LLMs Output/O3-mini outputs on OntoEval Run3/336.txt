Assuming that newspaper review instances are modelled as members of the class Cl_NewspaperReview (which is a subclass of Cl_Newspaper) and that a review relates a production via the property reviewsProduction and carries the star rating via hasStarRating, the following SPARQL query retrieves the star rating assigned by a given newspaper (here, filtered by its label) for a given production (filtered by its URI):

---------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?review ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_NewspaperReview ;
          :reviewsProduction ?production ;
          :hasStarRating ?starRating ;
          rdfs:label ?newspaperName .
  FILTER(?production = <http://example.org/productionURI> && ?newspaperName = "Il Gazzettino")
}
---------------------------------------------------

In a closed‚Äêworld setting this query will return the star rating for the specified production as reviewed by the given newspaper.
