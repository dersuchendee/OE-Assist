**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the star rating given by a newspaper for a production:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?production ?newspaper ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :reviewedBy ?newspaper .
  ?review :starRating ?starRating .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query assumes a closed world where all productions, reviews, and newspapers are explicitly declared in the ontology and uses the given properties (:hasReview, :reviewedBy, :starRating) to extract the answer.
