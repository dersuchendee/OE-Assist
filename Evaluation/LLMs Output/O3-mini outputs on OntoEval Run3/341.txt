The ontology models “star ratings” as the review rating given by a newspaper to a production (using the properties :reviewRating and :reviewedBy on instances of :Cl_ProductionReview that are linked to a production via :hasReview).

A sample SPARQL query answering the CQ could be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?productionName ?newspaper ?newspaperName ?rating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production ;
              :productionName ?productionName ;
              :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :reviewRating ?rating ;
          :reviewedBy ?newspaper .
  ?newspaper :newspaperName ?newspaperName .
}
ORDER BY ?productionName

This query retrieves the production’s name, the newspaper which provided the review, and the review’s “star rating,” thus supporting the competency question.
