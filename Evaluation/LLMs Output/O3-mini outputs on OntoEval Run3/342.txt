Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves the star rating given by a particular newspaper for a specific production:

-----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?newspaperName ?productionName ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_Review ;
          :hasNewspaper ?newspaper ;
          :hasProduction ?production ;
          :hasStarRating ?starRating .
  ?newspaper :newspaperName ?newspaperName .
  ?production :productionName ?productionName .
  # Optionally restrict to a specific newspaper and production
  FILTER(?newspaperName = "Il Gazzettino" && ?productionName = "The Merchant of Venice at The Grand Theatre")
}
-----------------------------------------------

This query uses the ontologyâ€™s review structure to extract the star rating for the production as given by the specified newspaper under a closed world assumption.
