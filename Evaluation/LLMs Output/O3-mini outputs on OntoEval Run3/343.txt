**Yes**

Assuming that individual productions are linked via the ratedBy property to a reified rating instance (of type Cl_NewspaperRating) which carries the starRating as a data property—and that the newspaper in question is identified via its rdfs:label—you can write a query such as:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?prodLabel ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production ;
              :ratedBy ?rating .
  ?rating a :Cl_NewspaperRating ;
          :starRating ?starRating ;
          rdfs:label ?newspaperLabel .
  FILTER(?newspaperLabel = "Il Gazzettino")
  OPTIONAL { ?production rdfs:label ?prodLabel . }
}
---------------------------------

This query retrieves each production that has a rating provided by the newspaper “Il Gazzettino” (which you can replace with any specific newspaper name) and extracts the starRating associated with it.
