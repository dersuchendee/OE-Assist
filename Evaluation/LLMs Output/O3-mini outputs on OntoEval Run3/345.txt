**Yes**

Assuming that a newspaper review is reified via the pivot class Cl_NewspaperReview—which is defined as a subclass of both Cl_Newspaper and Cl_Production—and that the star rating is attached as a data property on that review instance, we can answer the CQ. Under the closed‐world assumption the following query extracts, for a given newspaper and production, the star rating:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?newspaper ?production ?starRating
WHERE {
  ?newspaper a :Cl_Newspaper ;
             :hasReview ?review .
             
  ?review a :Cl_NewspaperReview, :Cl_Production ;
          :starRating ?starRating .
          
  # Assuming that the production details (e.g., play title) are also provided on the review,
  # we extract an identifying literal property if available:
  OPTIONAL { ?review :playTitle ?production }
}
ORDER BY ?newspaper ?production
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves each newspaper (instance of Cl_Newspaper), its associated review (which, as a Cl_NewspaperReview, also represents a reviewed production), and the star rating given by the newspaper.
