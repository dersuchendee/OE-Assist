Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the star rating given by a specific newspaper for a specific production:

----------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?starRating 
WHERE {
  # Identify the given newspaper and its published review
  ?newspaper a :Cl_Newspaper ;
             :publishedReview ?review .
             
  # Ensure the review concerns the specified production
  ?review :reviews ?production ;
          :starRating ?starRating .
          
  # Filter for the concrete newspaper and production (use appropriate URIs)
  FILTER(?newspaper = <http://www.example.org/test#Newspaper1> &&
         ?production = <http://www.example.org/test#Production1>)
}
---------- 

In this query, replace <http://www.example.org/test#Newspaper1> and <http://www.example.org/test#Production1> with the actual URIs identifying the newspaper and production in question. 

This CQ is answerable because the ontology reifies the review informationâ€”linking a newspaper (domain Cl_Newspaper) to a review (via :publishedReview), and then from the review to a production (via :reviews) and its star rating (via :starRating).
