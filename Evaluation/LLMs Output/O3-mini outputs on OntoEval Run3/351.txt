**Yes**

This competency question is answerable from the ontology. We can retrieve the employment start date for a given actorâ€“theatre pair by following the reified employment period. For example, if we want to know when FabioBianchi started working at TheGrandTheatreRome, the SPARQL query would be:

---------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?theatre ?theatreName ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor ;
         :op_hasEmploymentPeriod ?ep .
  ?ep :op_employmentIn ?theatre ;
      :dp_startDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor :hasName ?actorName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre :hasName ?theatreName . }
  FILTER(?actor = :FabioBianchi && ?theatre = :TheGrandTheatreRome)
}
---------------------------------------------------------

This query returns the actor, the theatre, and the date when the actor started working at that theatre.
