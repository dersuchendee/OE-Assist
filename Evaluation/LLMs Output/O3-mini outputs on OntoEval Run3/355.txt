Below is a SPARQL query that, using the closed world assumption, retrieves the start date of employment for an actor at a particular theatre. (You can replace the FILTER values with the appropriate names to target a specific actor and a specific theatre.)

PREFIX : <http://example.org/theatreontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?actor ?actorName ?theatre ?theatreName ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Employment .
  ?employment :hasEmployee ?actor .
  ?employment :hasEmployer ?theatre .
  ?employment :hasStartDate ?startDate .

  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreName . }
  
  # Replace the following filters with the desired actor/theatre names if needed:
  FILTER(?actorName = "Fabio Bianchi")
  FILTER(?theatreName = "The Grand Theatre")
}
------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the time (start date) when “Fabio Bianchi” (the actor) began his employment with “The Grand Theatre”.
