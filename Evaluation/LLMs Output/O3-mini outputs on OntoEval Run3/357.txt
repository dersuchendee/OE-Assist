Assuming that we want to retrieve the employment start date for a specific actor working at a specific theatre, we can use the properties defined in the ontology. For example, the ontology defines that an actor (instance of Cl_Actor) has an employment record (via the property hasEmployment) of type Cl_ActorEmployment that in turn has an employment date (hasEmploymentDate) and an association to a theatre (isEmployedIn). Under a closedâ€‘world assumption, we assume that all relevant employment data are explicitly stated. The following SPARQL query answers the CQ by retrieving the employment date for a given actor at a given theatre:

-----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?employmentDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor ;
         :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment :hasEmploymentDate ?employmentDate ;
              :isEmployedIn ?theatre .
  FILTER(?actor = <http://www.example.org/test#FabioBianchi> &&
         ?theatre = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificTheatre>)
}
-----------------------------------------------------

In this query replace <http://www.example.org/test#FabioBianchi> and <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificTheatre> with the appropriate IRIs for the actor and theatre in question.
