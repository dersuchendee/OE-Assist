**Yes**

We can answer the CQ using the employment relationships defined in the ontology. For example, to retrieve the employment start date for a given actor (e.g., :FabioBianchi) at a particular theatre (e.g., :GrandTheatre), one can use the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  ?employment :employmentIn ?theatre .
  FILTER(?actor = :FabioBianchi && ?theatre = :GrandTheatre)
}

This query extracts the start date for the employment of the specified actor at the specified theatre, thus answering the competency question under the closed world assumption.
