**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the employment start date for a given actor and a given theatre:

----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment ;
              :employmentActor ?actor ;
              :employedAt ?theatre ;
              :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  # Here you can filter for a specific actor and theatre:
  FILTER(?actor = :Actor_FabioBianchi && ?theatre = :Theatre_GrandTheatre)
}
----------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question by providing a way to extract “at what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?” through the employment details recorded in the ontology.
