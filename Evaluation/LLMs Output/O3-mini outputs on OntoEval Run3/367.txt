**Yes**
Assuming that the employment instance is reified (via the class Cl_ActorEmployment) to capture the actor’s employment date for a given theatre (using a property such as “forTheatre” to link the employment record to the theatre), a SPARQL query answering “At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?” can be written as follows:

———————————————————————————————
```sparql
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor ;
         :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment a :Cl_ActorEmployment ;
              :employmentStartDate ?startDate ;
              :forTheatre ?theatre .
  # Use FILTER to specify the particular actor and theatre.
  FILTER(?actor = :FabioBianchi && ?theatre = :TheGrandTheatre)
}
```
———————————————————————————————

In this query the following is assumed under a closed‐world interpretation:
1. Every employment relationship is reified as an instance of Cl_ActorEmployment.
2. The property :employmentStartDate records the date the actor started working.
3. A property (here named :forTheatre) links the employment record to the theatre.

Thus, the competency question is fully supported by the ontology.
