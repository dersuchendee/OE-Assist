**Yes**

Assuming that individual actors and theatres are identified in the data, the ontology lets you connect an actor to their employment (the pivot class that is also a theatre) via the property “:isEmployedAt” and retrieve the employment’s start date (via “:employmentStartDate”). Under the closed world assumption every asserted fact is taken as complete, so the following query extracts the start date for a given actor working for a given theatre:

----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?actor a :Cl_Actor .
  ?actor :isEmployedAt ?employment .
  ?employment a :Cl_Theatre .    # since Cl_Employment is also a Cl_Theatre
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
  
  # Optionally, restrict to a specific actor and theatre by their IRIs:
  FILTER(?actor = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificActor> &&
         ?employment = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificTheatre>)
}
----------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the competency question “At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?” is modelled by the given ontology.
