**Yes**

We can answer this competency question using the ontology because the employment start date is captured via the data property employmentStartDate (with domain Cl_Person) and the employedAt relation links a person (actor) to their theatre. Assuming we have individuals for the actor and theatre, a query may look like this:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?actor ?theatre ?employmentStartDate
WHERE {
  ?actor rdf:type :Cl_Person ;
         :employedAt ?theatre ;
         :employmentStartDate ?employmentStartDate .
  
  # Optionally, filter for a particular actor and theatre if known
  # FILTER(?actor = <http://www.example.org/test#FabioBianchi> && ?theatre = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificTheatre>)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves for each actor (a Cl_Person) that is employed at a theatre (via employedAt) the associated employmentStartDate, thus answering: “At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?” under the closed world assumption.
