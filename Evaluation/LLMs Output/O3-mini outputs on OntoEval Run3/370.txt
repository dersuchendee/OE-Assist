**Yes**

The ontology models the employment relationship between theatres and actors via the Cl_Employment class along with the property employmentStartDate. Thus, this CQ is answerable with a SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given actor and theatre, the starting date of the actorâ€™s employment.

Below is an example SPARQL query that extracts the start date for employment relationships (using the closed world assumption):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?theatre ?theatreLabel ?actor ?actorLabel ?startDate
WHERE {
  ?theatre a :Cl_Theatre .
  OPTIONAL { ?theatre rdfs:label ?theatreLabel. }
  
  ?theatre :employs ?employment .
  ?employment :employedActor ?actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel. }
  
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
}
ORDER BY ?theatre ?actor

This query demonstrates that the CQ "At what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?" is fully supported by the ontology.
