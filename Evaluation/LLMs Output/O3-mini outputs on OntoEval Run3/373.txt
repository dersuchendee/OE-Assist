**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that answers the competency question “What roles does a certain person have within a certain production at a certain point in time?” under the closed world assumption. In this query we assume you want to check for a person (e.g. with name "Fabio Bianchi"), a production (e.g. with title "The Merchant of Venice"), and a specific time (e.g. "2009-09-07T20:00:00Z"):

  FILTER(?productionTitle = "The Merchant of Venice"@en)
  FILTER(?timeInstant = "2009-09-07T20:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime)
}

This query retrieves the person’s roles (via the time-indexed role connection) and checks that the role belongs to the specified production at the given time, thus fully modeling the competency question as answerable within the ontology structure.
