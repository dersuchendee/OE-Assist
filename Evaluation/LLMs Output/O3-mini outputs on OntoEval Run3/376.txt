Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the roles an actor (person) plays in a given production at a specified time. (Note that you may replace the sample URIs and literal values with your actual resources and parameter values.)

PREFIX theatre: <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs:    <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?role ?roleLabel ?atTime
WHERE {
  # Select the actor of interest
  ?person a theatre:Actor ;
          rdfs:label "Fabio Bianchi" .    # change this literal to the specific person

  # The actor must participate in the production of interest
  ?person theatre:participatesIn ?production .
  FILTER(?production = theatre:MerchantOfVeniceProduction)   # update as needed

  # Via the chain, the actor has a role that is (reified to be) played in the production.
  ?person theatre:hasRole ?role .
  ?role theatre:isRoleOf ?production ;
        rdfs:label ?roleLabel ;
        theatre:atTime ?atTime .

  # Only retrieve roles that are assigned at the specific time (adjust the time literal as needed)
  FILTER(?atTime = "2009-09-07T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
ORDER BY ?roleLabel
-------------------------------------------------

In this query:
– We start by selecting the individual actor (here “Fabio Bianchi”).
– We require that the actor participates in a given production (e.g. MerchantOfVeniceProduction).
– We then follow the asserted role (via theatre:hasRole and theatre:isRoleOf) and retrieve the associated time using the property theatre:atTime.
– Finally, we filter by the desired point in time. 

Because all the classes and properties needed to answer the CQ are modelled in the ontology, the CQ is answerable under the closed‐world assumption.
