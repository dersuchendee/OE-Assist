**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that uses the reified role assignment structure to retrieve the roles a person has in a production at a given time point:

---------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?person ?role ?production ?timePoint
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :assignedRoleAssignment ?assignment .
  
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :roleAssignmentInProduction ?assignment .
  
  ?timePoint a :Cl_TimePoint .
  ?timePoint :roleAssignmentAtTimePoint ?assignment .
  
  ?role :roleAssignmentOfRole ?assignment .
}
---------------------------------------------------------

This query uses the fact that a Cl_RoleAssignment (used to reify the relationship) connects a person (via :assignedRoleAssignment), a production (via :roleAssignmentInProduction), and a time point (via :roleAssignmentAtTimePoint) along with the actual role (via :roleAssignmentOfRole). Under the closed world assumption, the query fully captures the intended competency question.
