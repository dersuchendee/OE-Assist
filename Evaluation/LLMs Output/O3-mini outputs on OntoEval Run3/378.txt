**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that answers the CQ under a closed‚Äêworld assumption. This query retrieves the role(s) that a given person (e.g. Fabio Bianchi) has in a given production (e.g. the Merchant of Venice production) and that are valid at a specified time point.

Assume that:
1. Instances for the person and production already exist.
2. Each RoleAssignment links a person (via :assignedPerson), a role (via :assignedRole), the production (via :inProduction) and the valid time interval (via :during). The time interval is defined by its start and end dates using the properties :hasStartDate and :hasEndDate.

You can plug in the desired IRIs (here shown as placeholders) and time point accordingly.

  ?assignment :during ?interval .
  ?interval :hasStartDate ?start ;
            :hasEndDate ?end .

  # Check that the given time point (e.g., 2009-09-08T00:00:00) is within the valid interval.
  FILTER(xsd:dateTime("2009-09-08T00:00:00") >= ?start && xsd:dateTime("2009-09-08T00:00:00") <= ?end)
}

This query fully addresses the competency question by extracting the roles (and their corresponding validity intervals) for the specified person within the specified production at the given time.
