**No**

The provided ontology does not represent temporal aspects for ensemble membership, so while we can extract the members of an ensemble, we cannot limit them “at a certain point in time.” Below is a SPARQL query that returns the ensemble members (a partial answer):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/theatre_ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?ensemble ?member ?name
WHERE {
  ?ensemble a :Ensemble ;
            :hasMember ?member .
  OPTIONAL { ?member :hasName ?name . }
}
