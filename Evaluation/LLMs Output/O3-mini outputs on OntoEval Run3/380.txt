**Yes**
Below is one example SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given person and production at a given time, the roles that the person fulfils. (We assume that the ontology re‐ifies the relation between a person, a role, and the production with the pivot class Cl_PersonRoleInProductionAtTime and that there are properties linking the pivot instance to its person, role, and the time of the production.)

For example, if you want to know which roles FabioBianchi has in the MerchantOfVenice production at a given date (here represented by ?time), then a query using the closed‐world assumption could be written as follows:

-----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?role ?time
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production ;
              :hasPersonRoleInProductionAtTime ?pivot .
  ?pivot a :Cl_PersonRoleInProductionAtTime ;
         :hasPerson ?person ;
         :hasRole ?role ;
         :roleTime ?time .
  FILTER(
         ?person = <http://www.example.org/test#FabioBianchi> &&
         ?production = <http://www.example.org/test#MerchantOfVenice> &&
         ?time = "2009-09-10"^^xsd:date
         )
}
ORDER BY ?role
-----------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the CQ is fully answerable by the ontology.
