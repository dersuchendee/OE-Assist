Below is a parameterized SPARQL query that retrieves the roles held by a given person (actor) in a given production on a specified date. This query relies on the fact that the ontology reifies the role information via the property :hasRole (with domain :Cl_Actor and range :Cl_ActorRole), along with the properties :hasRoleInProduction (associating the role with a production) and :hasRoleDate (indicating the time at which the role occurs).

SELECT ?actor ?role ?roleLabel ?production ?roleDate
WHERE {
  # Specify the particular person (actor) instance and production instance.
  VALUES ?actor { <http://www.example.org/test#YourActorInstance> }
  VALUES ?production { <http://www.example.org/test#YourProductionInstance> }
  
  # Retrieve the roles (reified via Cl_ActorRole) for the actor.
  ?actor :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :hasRoleInProduction ?production .
  ?role :hasRoleDate ?roleDate .
  
  # Optionally get a textual label for the role.
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel. }
  
  # Filter for the specified point in time.
  FILTER(?roleDate = "2021-09-15"^^xsd:date)   # Replace with the intended date, e.g., the point in time of interest.
}
ORDER BY ?actor ?roleDate

This query shows that, under a closed world assumption, all necessary links—from an actor to their role, to a production, and to the time the role is held—are present in the ontology, and so the competency question is fully answerable.
