**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, given a person, a production, and a point in time, retrieves the roles that the person has in that production when the point in time falls between the assignment’s start and end dates.

For example, you could write:

----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?production ?role ?roleLabel ?start ?end
WHERE {
  # Bind a specific point in time (this can be changed as needed)
  BIND(xsd:date("2009-09-15") AS ?checkDate)
  
  # Identify the actor (replace :FabioBianchi with the desired individual IRI)
  ?person a :Cl_Actor .
  FILTER(?person = :FabioBianchi) .
  
  # Link the actor to his role assignments
  ?person :op_roleOf ?roleAssignment .
  
  # Ensure the assignment refers to a role and a production
  ?roleAssignment :op_hasRole ?role .
  ?roleAssignment :op_roleInProduction ?production .
  
  # Get the start and end dates of the role assignment
  ?roleAssignment :dp_startDate ?start .
  ?roleAssignment :dp_endDate ?end .
  
  # Check if the given point in time falls within the role’s duration
  FILTER(?checkDate >= ?start && ?checkDate <= ?end) .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?person ?production ?start
----------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the CQ "What roles does a certain person have within a certain production at a certain point in time?" is fully answerable by the ontology under a closed world assumption, as all required classes and properties (Cl_Actor, Cl_RoleAssignment, Cl_Role, Cl_TheatreProduction, and the time qualifiers dp_startDate and dp_endDate) are present and connected.
