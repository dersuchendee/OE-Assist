**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves for a given actor in a given production at a specified time all the roles that have been recorded. (In this query the “certain person”, “certain production” and “certain point in time” are provided as filter values; you may substitute the URIs and dates as needed.)

SELECT ?actorName ?production ?roleName ?roleDate

  ?actor a :Cl_Actor ;

  ?actorRole a :Cl_ActorRole ; 
             :roleName ?roleName ;
             :roleDate ?roleDate .
  # Since the reified actor role is also declared to be a subclass of Cl_Production,
  # we use it to indicate the production context.
  ?actorRole a :Cl_Production .
  
  # Filter for the “certain person”, “certain production” and “certain point in time”

In this design the actor’s role instance (of type Cl_ActorRole) plays a dual role (as an instance of Cl_Role and Cl_Production as well as Cl_Date), so the query “binds” the production context and extracts the role name along with its date.
