**Yes**

Assuming that a “production role” is modelled as a reified membership in the pivot class :Cl_ProductionRole (which is declared as a subclass of :Cl_Person, :Cl_Production, and :Cl_Role) and that a person’s participation in a given production (with an associated role name and role date) is captured via the object property :hasRoleInProduction, we can answer the CQ by “joining” the person to its production–role membership. In a closed‐world view we assume that any instance that is not explicitly stated does not hold. Thus, for a given person, a given production, and a given date (or time point) we can restrict the results accordingly.

For example, if we assume the caller provides specific URIs for the person and the production and a date (or time point) for which the role is in effect, the SPARQL query would be as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?roleName ?roleDate
WHERE {
  # Assume these are the given parameters:
  VALUES ?person { <http://www.example.org/test#Fabio_Bianchi> }
  VALUES ?production { <http://www.example.org/test#Merchant_of_Venice_Production> }
  VALUES ?targetDate { "2009-09-15"^^xsd:date }

  ?person :hasRoleInProduction ?role .
  ?role a :Cl_ProductionRole ;
        :roleName ?roleName ;
        :roleDate ?roleDate .

  # Since :Cl_ProductionRole is also a subtype of :Cl_Production,
  # we can restrict to the given production by requiring that
  # the role–instance is (or denotes) the specific production:
  FILTER(?role = ?production)

  # Filter based on the designated (point in) time.
  FILTER(?roleDate = ?targetDate)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves the role name and role date for the specified person in the given production at the exact time (here “2009‑09‑15”). Hence, the ontology does model the CQ.
