**Yes**
Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for a given person the role assignments (reified as instances of Cl_RoleAssignment, which “mixes” a person, a production and a date) including the role’s name and the date at which it applies. (In this query the person and the production are given as input parameters.)

SELECT ?roleName ?roleDate
WHERE {
  # The given person is linked to role assignments via :hasRoleInProduction
  ?person :hasRoleInProduction ?roleAssignment .
  ?roleAssignment a :Cl_RoleAssignment ;      # reification: also a Cl_Person, Cl_Production & Cl_Date 
                  :roleName ?roleName ;
                  :roleDate ?roleDate .
  # In this model the role assignment is also an instance of a production.
  ?roleAssignment a :Cl_Production .

  # Parameterized filters for a specific person and production.

/* 
In this query we assume that:
- Individuals such as <http://www.example.org/test#FabioBianchi> represent the person of interest.
- <http://www.example.org/test#TheMerchantOfVeniceProduction> is the identifier of the production in which we want to know the roles.
If needed you can replace these IRIs by the appropriate ones from your data set.
