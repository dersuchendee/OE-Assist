**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that lists each production along with its unique premier event. Under the closed‐world assumption, we treat a production with no stated premier as violating the “exactly one” requirement. In other words, if the data is complete, every production should appear with one and only one premier event.

SELECT ?production ?premierEvent
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremierEvent ?premierEvent .
}
GROUP BY ?production ?premierEvent
HAVING (COUNT(?premierEvent) = 1)

This query extracts all productions that have exactly one premier event, thereby showing that the CQ “A production has exactly one premier” is supported by the ontology.
