**Yes**

The ontology asserts that every production (of type :Cl_Production) must have exactly one premier, enforced by a cardinality restriction on the property :premierDate. Therefore, the competency question can be answered with a SPARQL query that retrieves each production and its premier date.

For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
