**Yes**

Assuming a closed‚Äêworld view (i.e. if a premier date is not explicitly provided then none exists), the ontology uses a functional property for premier dates on productions. Therefore each production that has a premier will have one and only one premier date. We can retrieve the premier of each production with the following SPARQL query:

----------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_TheatreProduction .
  ?production :dp_premierDate ?premierDate .
}
ORDER BY ?production
----------------

This query returns each production along with its premier date, thereby verifying that each production has exactly one premier as modelled by the ontology.
