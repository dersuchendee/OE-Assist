**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves each production together with its single premier (its premier date) by confirming that a production has exactly one premier:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

# This query first selects productions that have exactly one associated premier
# Then it returns the production identifier, the premier node and its premierDate.
SELECT ?production ?premier ?premierDate
WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?production
    WHERE {
      ?production a :Cl_Production .
      OPTIONAL { ?production :hasPremier ?premier . }
    }
    GROUP BY ?production
    HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)
  }
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}
-------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
1. The inner SELECT finds all individuals of type :Cl_Production and (using the closed world assumption) only selects those for which exactly one :hasPremier relation exists.
2. The outer query then retrieves the premier individual as well as its premierDate.
3. This shows that the ontology models the competency question “A production has exactly one premier.”
