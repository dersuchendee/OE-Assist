**Yes**

The ontology includes a restriction on :hasPremier stating that any instance of :Cl_Production must have exactly one premier (a :Cl_Date). Assuming a closed world, you can extract the premier for each production with the following SPARQL query:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?production ?premier
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
}
ORDER BY ?production
------------------------------------------------

This query returns each production along with its single premier date, thereby satisfying the competency question.
