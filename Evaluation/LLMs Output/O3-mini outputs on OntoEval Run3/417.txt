**Yes**
Below is one suitable SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, returns only those productions that have one (and only one) premier date:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  ?production a :Cl_Production .
  ?production :premierDate ?premierDate .
  
  # Ensure that there is no other premierDate value for the same production.
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?production :premierDate ?otherDate .
    FILTER(?otherDate != ?premierDate)
  }
}

This query extracts each production along with its unique premier date, verifying that every production indeed has exactly one premier as stated in the CQ.
