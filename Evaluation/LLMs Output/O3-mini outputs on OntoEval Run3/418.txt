**Yes**

We can verify that the ontology supports the competency question “A production has exactly one premier” because productions are connected to a production premier via the property :hasPremier. Under the closed‐world assumption we can select only those productions for which exactly one premier exists.

For example, the following SPARQL query returns each production that has exactly one associated premier along with its premier’s date:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?production ?premierDate
WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?production (COUNT(?premier) AS ?premierCount)
    WHERE {
      ?production a :Cl_Production .
      ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
    }
    GROUP BY ?production
    HAVING (COUNT(?premier) = 1)
  }
  ?production :hasPremier ?premier .
  ?premier :premierDate ?premierDate .
}

This query ensures that only productions with exactly one premier are returned, thus answering the competency question.
