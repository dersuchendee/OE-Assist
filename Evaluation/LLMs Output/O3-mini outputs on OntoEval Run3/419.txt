**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the instruments played by a specified person using the ontology’s classes and properties:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?instrument ?instrumentLabel
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :hasName ?name ;
          :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  FILTER(?name = "NameOfPerson") .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }
}
------------------------------------------------------------

In this query you replace "NameOfPerson" with the specific person’s name you are interested in. The query uses the object property :playsInstrument that connects a person (member of Cl_Person) to an instrument (member of Cl_Instrument), which together with the reification provided by :Cl_InstrumentPlaying confirms that the competency question is fully supported.
