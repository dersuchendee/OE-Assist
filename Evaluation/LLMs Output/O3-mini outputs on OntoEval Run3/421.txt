**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the instruments that a given person (for example, :AnthonyKiedis) plays:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?instrument ?instrumentName
WHERE {
  :AnthonyKiedis a :Cl_Person .
  :AnthonyKiedis :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument :hasName ?instrumentName . }
}

This query works because the ontology explicitly models the connection between persons and instruments via the property :playsInstrument (and by reification via :Cl_InstrumentPlaying if needed), allowing us to answer the competency question.
