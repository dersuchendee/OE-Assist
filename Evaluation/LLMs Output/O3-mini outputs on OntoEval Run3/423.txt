**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, will return the instruments played by a given musician (you can bind the musician of interest via ?person):

PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?instrument ?instrumentLabel
WHERE {
  ?person a :Musician .
  ?person :plays ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel. }
  
  # Replace the IRI below with the specific musicianâ€™s IRI.
  FILTER(?person = :SomeMusician)
}
