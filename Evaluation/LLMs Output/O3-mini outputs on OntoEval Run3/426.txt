**Yes**

Assuming the ontology models persons and instruments as reified classes interconnected via the property :plays (with :Cl_Person as domain and :Cl_Instrument as range), we can answer the CQ by directly querying for the instruments played by a given person. Under the closed world assumption, only individuals explicitly linked by the :plays property will be returned. For example, if we parameterize the query with a given person (e.g., :JohnFrusciante), one SPARQL query would be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?personName ?instrument ?instrumentName
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person :name ?personName . }
  
  ?person :plays ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument :instrumentName ?instrumentName . }

  FILTER(?person = :JohnFrusciante)
}

This query extracts the instruments that the specified person plays along with optional labels, thus fully supporting the competency question.
