**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the instruments played by a given person based on the ontologyâ€™s modelling of instrument playing via the Cl_InstrumentPlaying class and the properties playsInstrument and playedBy:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :playsInstrument ?playing .
  ?playing :playedBy ?instrument .
  # To restrict to a specific person you could add a FILTER with their URI
  # FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificPersonURI>)
}

This query extracts the instruments (via the property :playedBy) that are associated with a reified instance of instrument playing (via :playsInstrument) for a person.
