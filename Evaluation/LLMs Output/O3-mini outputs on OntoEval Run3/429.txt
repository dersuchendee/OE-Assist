**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the instruments played by a given person (replace the placeholder URI with the specific person’s URI):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :playsInstrument ?instrumentPlaying .
  ?instrumentPlaying :playedBy ?instrument .
  FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#SomePersonURI>) 
} 

This query leverages the reification pattern in the ontology—in which the association between a person and an instrument is represented by an instance of Cl_InstrumentPlaying—and under the closed world assumption this formulation fully answers the competency question.
