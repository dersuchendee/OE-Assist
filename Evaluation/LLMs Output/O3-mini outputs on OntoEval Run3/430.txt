**Yes**

Assuming the closed‐world perspective, the ontology asserts directly which instruments each person plays using the “playsInstrument” property. One can write a SPARQL query such as:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?person ?instrument
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :playsInstrument ?instrument .
}

This query returns for each individual of type Cl_Person the instruments that they play, thereby answering the CQ "What instruments does a certain person play?" as modelled by the ontology.
