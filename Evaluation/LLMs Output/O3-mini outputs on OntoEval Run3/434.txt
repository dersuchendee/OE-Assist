**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query you can use to extract the tracks that are contained in the album “StadiumArcadium” (the CQ implied by the story):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?track
WHERE {
  :StadiumArcadium :containsTrack ?track .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query “answers” the CQ in the sense that, using the properties defined in the ontology (including the cardinality restriction on Cl_Album indicating at least one track must be contained), you can retrieve all track individuals that are linked to the album StadiumArcadium.
