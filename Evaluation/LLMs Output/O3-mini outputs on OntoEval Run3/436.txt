**Yes**

Assuming that the “certain person” is identified by a URI (for example, :targetPerson), you can run the following query to list all instruments that person plays:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?instrument ?instrumentLabel
WHERE {
  :targetPerson a :Cl_Person ;
                :playsInstrument ?instrument .
  OPTIONAL { ?instrument rdfs:label ?instrumentLabel . }
}

In a closed‐world setting, this query will return exactly those instruments that are explicitly recorded in the ontology as being played by the person.
