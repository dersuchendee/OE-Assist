**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, returns the persons (members) of a given band (e.g. the RedHotChiliPeppers) who were members at a specified point in time. In this example the point in time is given as 2004-09-01. (You can replace the band IRI and the query date as needed.)

SELECT ?person ?role ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :hasMembership :RedHotChiliPeppers ;
              :hasRole ?role ;
              :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd . }
  
  # The given point of time for the query (adjust as needed)
  BIND(xsd:date("2004-09-01") AS ?queryDate)
  
  # Filter: membership must have started on or before the query date,
  # and if there is an end date it must be after the query date.
  FILTER( ?membershipStart <= ?queryDate &&
         ( !bound(?membershipEnd) || ?queryDate <= ?membershipEnd )
  )
}
ORDER BY ?membershipStart

This query answers the CQ “What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?” by retrieving the band members whose memberships have started before (or on) and have not ended before the given query date.
