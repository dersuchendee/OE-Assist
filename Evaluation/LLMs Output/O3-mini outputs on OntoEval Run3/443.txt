**No**  
Because the ontology does not encode the temporal boundaries (such as start/end instants or a time‐containment relation) required to check if a membership is valid “at a certain point in time,” we cannot fully answer the CQ. However, we can provide a partial answer that returns the band’s memberships with their associated (but undetailed) membership time.

For example:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX time: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#>

SELECT ?musician ?name ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  # Get memberships for the given band (here fixed as RedHotChiliPeppers; replace as needed)
  ?membership a :Membership ;
              :membershipInBand :RedHotChiliPeppers ;
              :membershipTime ?membershipTime .
  
  # Find the musician linked to that membership
  ?musician :memberOf ?membership ;
            :hasName ?name .
  
  # (Note: There is no detailed temporal structure to check if ?membershipTime contains a given time.)
}
-------------------------------------------------

Under a closed world assumption, without further time interval properties, we cannot filter memberships according to a specific instant.
