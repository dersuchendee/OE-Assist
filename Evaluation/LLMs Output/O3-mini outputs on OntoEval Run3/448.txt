Below is an example SPARQL query that uses the reified BandMembership (with its associated time interval) to retrieve the members of a given band at a specific point in time. (In the example below the band is “Red Hot Chili Peppers” and the specific point in time is given as “2006-08-11”—you can replace these values with the desired band IRI and time value.)

SELECT ?member ?memberName ?role ?roleName ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :BandMembership ;
              :hasBand :RedHotChiliPeppers ;       # change this to the target band
              :involvesMember ?member ;
              :hasTimeInterval ?ti .
  ?ti :startDate ?startDate ;
      :endDate ?endDate .

  # Ensure the given point in time falls within the membership's time interval.
  FILTER("2006-08-11"^^xsd:date >= ?startDate && "2006-08-11"^^xsd:date <= ?endDate)

  OPTIONAL { ?member :personName ?memberName . }
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :hasRole ?role .
             ?role :roleName ?roleName . }
}
ORDER BY ?member

This query verifies that the ontology models the competency question since it is able (under a closed‐world assumption) to extract which individuals (members) were part of a band (given by a reified BandMembership with an associated time interval) at the specified time.
