**Yes**

Assuming that the ontology models temporal band memberships via the reified class Cl_BandMembership (which relates a Cl_Person and a Cl_Band together with a Cl_TimePeriod via the property membershipPeriod), we can answer the CQ “What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?” by selecting persons that are linked via a band membership whose associated time period contains the given time‐point.

Below is an example SPARQL query. (In this query the band and time point are provided as input parameters—for example the band “RedHotChiliPeppers” and the desired time point “2004-09-15T00:00:00Z”. It is assumed that a time period is modelled with properties that indicate its beginning and end (here, :hasStart and :hasEnd) so that the given time falls within the interval.):

  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
}

This query returns all persons (and optionally their labels) who have a band membership in “RedHotChiliPeppers” that is active at the specified point in time.
