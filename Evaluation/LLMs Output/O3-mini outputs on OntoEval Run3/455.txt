**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves for a given band (here shown as “Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers”) the persons with a band membership recorded at a specified time. (In a real query you could parameterize the band and the time.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?band ?member ?memberLabel ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership ;
              :membershipInBand ?band ;
              :hasMember ?member ;
              :atTime ?membershipTime .
  FILTER(?band = :Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers 
         && ?membershipTime = "1988-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime)
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
}

In this query we assume that all membership information is explicitly asserted (a closed‐world view), so the result comprises exactly the members of the specified band at the given time.
