**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world reading of this ontology, retrieves the (reified) membership assertions for a given band – here “RedHotChiliPeppers” – that are valid for a given time (specified as a parameter). (In this example we use “2005-01-01” as a sample date.) Note that the ontology models membership using the reified class Cl_Membership with time properties (e.g. :membershipStart and optionally :membershipEnd), so we can “join” the information about a person’s membership with the band.

Assuming that each membership individual (of type :Cl_Membership) is linked both to the band (via :memberOf) and the band member (via a property such as :hasMember or by its identifier being related to a person already asserted as a member), one possible query is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  # Select the membership assertions for the band
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership ;
              :memberOf :RedHotChiliPeppers ;
              :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd . }
  
  # Link the membership to the person (assuming a linking property such as :hasMember)
  ?membership :hasMember ?person .
  
  # Restrict to membership in effect at the specified date (e.g., “2005-01-01”)
  FILTER (
      xsd:date("2005-01-01") >= ?membershipStart &&
      ( !bound(?membershipEnd) || xsd:date("2005-01-01") <= ?membershipEnd )
  )
}
ORDER BY ?membershipStart
--------------------------------------------------------------

In this query we assume the following:
1. The band “RedHotChiliPeppers” is an individual of type :Cl_Band.
2. Memberships are represented as individuals of type :Cl_Membership, linking the band to a person by a property (here :hasMember).
3. Each membership has a start date (and may have an end date), so that the FILTER clause selects only those memberships active at the specified time.

Under a closed‐world assumption, if a membership is not recorded the query will simply not return that person.

This SPARQL query fully “answers” the CQ using the ontology’s reified membership model, so the competency question is modelled by the ontology.
