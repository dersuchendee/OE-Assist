SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?city ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate ;
               :performanceLocation ?city .
  ?city a :Cl_City ;
        :locatedInRegion ?region .
  ?region a :Cl_Region ;
          :locatedInCountry ?country .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question regarding the location of performances by retrieving the performance along with its associated city, region, and country.
