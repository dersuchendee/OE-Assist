**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that uses the reified “membership” relations (i.e. instances of Cl_PersonRoleBandTime) to extract, for a given band and a chosen time point, the persons (and optionally their roles) that were members at that time. Note that under the closed‐world assumption we restrict memberships to those with a recorded time not later than the given “snapshot” date. You can adjust the filter value as needed.

SELECT ?person ?role ?membershipTime
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_PersonRoleBandTime ;
              :hasBand :RedHotChiliPeppers ;
              :hasPerson ?person ;
              :hasRole ?role ;
              :hasTime ?membershipTime .
  # Only consider memberships that started on or before the given time point.
  FILTER(?membershipTime <= "1987-01-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
ORDER BY ?membershipTime

This query answers the CQ “What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?” by returning the band members (and their roles) of RedHotChiliPeppers valid at or before January 1, 1987.
