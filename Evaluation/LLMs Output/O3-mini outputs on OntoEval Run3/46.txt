**Yes**

We can answer the competency question using the ontology by retrieving actors and the competencies they hold through either the direct relation (hasCompetency) or via the reified relation (actorHasCompetency â†’ competencyOfActor). For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves, for each actor, the competencies they hold:

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?actor ?competency
WHERE {
  ?actor rdf:type :Cl_Actor .
  
  { 
    ?actor :hasCompetency ?competency .
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?actor :actorHasCompetency ?actorCompetency .
    ?actorCompetency :competencyOfActor ?competency .
  }
}
----------------------------------

This query supports the competency question under a closed world assumption by extracting actors that have a competency either directly or via a linked reified structure, thus fully modelling the competency question posed in the OS.
