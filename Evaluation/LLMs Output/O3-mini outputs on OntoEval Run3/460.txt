**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, returns the persons (members) of a given band when their membership (with start and end dates) is active at a specified point in time. In this example the band is given by its URI (here :Band_X) and the date of interest is provided (as "YYYY-MM-DD"^^xsd:date):

SELECT ?person ?personName ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership ;
              :membershipBand :Band_X ;
              :membershipPerson ?person ;
              :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate ;
              :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personName . }
  # Replace "2005-01-01" with the date of interest.
  FILTER (xsd:date("2005-01-01") >= ?membershipStartDate &&
          xsd:date("2005-01-01") <= ?membershipEndDate)
}
ORDER BY ?person

Explanation:
• This query finds all instances of :Cl_Membership that link a person and a band (:membershipBand) and retrieves the membership’s start and end dates.
• It then filters those memberships to keep only the ones that are “active” at the given date (in this example, January 1, 2005).
• The use of a closed world assumption means that if a membership does not explicitly have an end date or its dates do not bracket the given point in time, it is not considered active.

Such a query shows that the ontology models the competency question, making it answerable via SPARQL.
