**Yes**

Assuming we adopt the closed world assumption and treat the available reification (via the Cl_Membership class and its properties) as fully describing the band memberships over time, this competency question is answerable. For a given band and a point in time, we can query for memberships where the queried date falls between the membershipStart and membershipEnd dates, and then retrieve the member attached via the membership relation.

For example, to find the members of a band (here parameterized as a band resource, e.g., :RedHotChiliPeppers) at a given point in time (e.g., "2005-01-01"), the SPARQL query might be:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?member ?memberLabel 
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership .
  ?membership :membershipIn ?band .         # The band to which the membership relates
  ?membership :memberOf ?member .             # The person who is the member
  ?membership :membershipStart ?start .
  ?membership :membershipEnd ?end .
  
  FILTER(?band = :RedHotChiliPeppers) .      # Specify the band of interest
  FILTER(xsd:date("2005-01-01") >= ?start && xsd:date("2005-01-01") <= ?end) .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
}
------------------------------------------------

This query returns the members (and their optional labels) of the specified band at the given point in time according to the ontology structure.
