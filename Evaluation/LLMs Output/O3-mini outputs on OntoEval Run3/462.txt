**Yes**
Below is one way to write a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the persons (members) who were members of a given band at a specified point in time. (In this query, you supply the band’s IRI and the time point as parameters.)

SELECT ?member ?memberLabel ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  # Find memberships that join a person with a band
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership .
  ?membership :membershipIn ?band .
  ?member :hasMembership ?membership .
  
  # Get the membership start time (mandatory) and end time if available
  ?membership :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd. }
  
  # Filter by the specific band and time point.
  # Replace <BandIRI> with the band’s IRI (e.g., RedHotChiliPeppers)
  # Replace "YYYY-MM-DD" with the desired date
  FILTER (
    ?band = <BandIRI> &&
    xsd:date("YYYY-MM-DD") >= ?membershipStart &&
      ( !BOUND(?membershipEnd) || xsd:date("YYYY-MM-DD") <= ?membershipEnd )
  )
  
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?membershipStart
────────────────────────────

In this query the FILTER clause checks that the supplied date (here represented as xsd:date("YYYY-MM-DD")) falls on or after the membership’s start date and, if an end date is given, before or on the membership’s end date. Thus, the question “What are the members of a certain band at a certain point in time?” is supported by the ontology.
