Below is a SPARQL query that exploits the membership reification in the ontology. In this example the query returns the members of a given band (here assumed to be :Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers) that were members at a given point in time (here using the date "2004-09-01"). Adjust the band IRI and time literal as needed.

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personLabel ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  # Select the band of interest.
  BIND(:Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers AS ?band) .
  
  # Find the reified membership record linking a person to the band.
  ?membership a :Cl_Membership ;
              :membershipInBand ?band ;
              :hasMembership ?person ;
              :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd . }
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  
  # Define the time point for which membership is investigated.
  BIND(xsd:date("2004-09-01") AS ?pointInTime) .
  
  # A valid membership at the given time must have started on or before
  # the pointInTime, and either not have an end date (ongoing) or have ended on/after that time.
  FILTER (?membershipStart <= ?pointInTime && (!bound(?membershipEnd) || ?pointInTime <= ?membershipEnd))
}
ORDER BY ?person

This query shows that the ontology fully supports the competency question by connecting bands, persons, and their membership intervals.
