**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that uses the band‐membership reification (including the role and the time stamp) to answer the CQ. In this example the query retrieves, for a given person and band at a specified date‐time, the role that person played in that band:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?personName ?bandName ?role ?time
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_BandMembership ;
              :membershipOfPerson ?person ;
              :membershipInBand ?band ;
              :hasRole ?role ;
              :atTime ?time .
  ?person :hasName ?personName .
  ?band :hasName ?bandName .
  # Replace :SomePerson and :SomeBand with the actual individuals and adjust the time as needed:
  FILTER(?person = :SomePerson &&
         ?band = :SomeBand &&
         ?time = "2005-01-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
---------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question under the closed world assumption since the reification class for band membership connects a person, a band and includes a role at a particular point in time.
