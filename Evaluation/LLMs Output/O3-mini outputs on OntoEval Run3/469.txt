The ontology uses reified band memberships (via ns1:BandMembership) that record the time interval during which a person is a member of a band (using ns1:memberDuring with a time interval having a begin and end date). Thus we can formulate a query that, for a given person, band, and a point in time, checks that the membership’s time interval covers that date and then returns the person’s role (via ns1:hasRole). For example:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?role
WHERE {
  ?person ns1:hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership ns1:membershipInBand ?band .
  ?membership ns1:memberDuring ?interval .
  ?interval ns1:hasBeginDate ?begin .
  ?interval ns1:hasEndDate ?end .
  ?person ns1:hasRole ?role .
  
  # Replace the following with the desired person, band, and time.
  FILTER(
    ?person = ns1:JohnFrusciante &&
    ?band = ns1:RedHotChiliPeppers &&
    xsd:date("2005-01-01") >= ?begin &&
    xsd:date("2005-01-01") <= ?end
  )
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the role that a specific person (here John Frusciante) has in a given band (Red Hot Chili Peppers) at the specific time (e.g., January 1, 2005).
