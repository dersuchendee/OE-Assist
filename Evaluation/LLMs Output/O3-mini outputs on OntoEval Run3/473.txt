**Yes**

Below is a sample SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, returns for each person in a given band the role they held during a specified time (by checking that the given point in time falls between the start and end dates defined in the reified member role):

SELECT ?person ?personName ?band ?bandName ?role ?roleName ?timePeriod ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  OPTIONAL { ?person :name ?personName . }
  
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
  ?role :atTime ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :startDate ?startDate .
  ?timePeriod :endDate ?endDate .
  
  ?person :memberOf ?band .
  OPTIONAL { ?band :bandName ?bandName . }
  
  # Filter for a chosen point in time (e.g., '2006-01-01')
  FILTER ( "2006-01-01"^^xsd:date >= ?startDate && "2006-01-01"^^xsd:date <= ?endDate )
}
ORDER BY ?person ?band
------------------------------------------------

This query is answerable because the ontology reifies the person–band membership using a pivot class (Cl_MemberRole) bound to a time period, which in turn allows one to determine the role that a person had in a band at a specific point in time.
