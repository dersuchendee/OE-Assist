**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that – under a closed‐world assumption and using placeholder values – retrieves the (band) role that a given person has in a given band at a particular point in time. (In a real‐data scenario, you would replace the literal labels and time with the desired values.)

SELECT ?roleLabel ?timePeriod ?start ?end
WHERE {
  # select the person by name
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          rdfs:label "John Frusciante" ;
          :hasRole ?bandRole .
  
  # the band role should be associated to a band (by the property :roleOf)
  ?bandRole :roleOf ?band ;
            rdfs:label ?roleLabel ;
            :rolePeriod ?timePeriod .
  
  # select the band by name
  ?band rdfs:label "Red Hot Chili Peppers" .
  
  # assume the time period is described with a start and end (if available)
  ?timePeriod :startTime ?start ;
              :endTime ?end .
  
  # filter to include only roles in effect at the desired point in time.
  FILTER("2006-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime >= ?start &&
         "2006-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime <= ?end)
}
ORDER BY ?roleLabel
---------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports answering the CQ “What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?” by retrieving the band‐role (with its time period) that links a person and a band.
