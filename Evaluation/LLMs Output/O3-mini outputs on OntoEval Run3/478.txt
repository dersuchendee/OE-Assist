**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the role a given person has in a given band at a specific time. (You can replace the placeholder IRIs and the literal time with the values of interest.)

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?band ?role ?time
WHERE {
  ?roleAssignment a :Cl_BandRole ;
                  :roleOfPerson ?person ;
                  :roleInBand ?band ;
                  :hasRole ?role ;
                  :roleAtTime ?time .
  
  # Replace the following filters with your specific individual and time:
  FILTER(?person = :SomePerson)
  FILTER(?band = :SomeBand)
  FILTER(?time = "1988-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime)
}  

This query can be used under the closed-world assumption to fully answer the competency question.
