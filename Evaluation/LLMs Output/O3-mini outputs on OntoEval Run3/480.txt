**Yes**

The ontology includes a reified class (Cl_BandRole) that links a person (via :roleOf), a band (via :roleInBand), a role (via :hasRole) and a timestamp (via :roleTime). This fully supports answering the competency question “What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?” under a closed‐world assumption.

For example, a SPARQL query to retrieve the role information for a given person (e.g. :John_Frusciante) in a given band (e.g. :Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers) is:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?role ?time
WHERE {
  ?bandRole a :Cl_BandRole ;
            :roleOf :John_Frusciante ;
            :hasRole ?role ;
            :roleInBand :Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers ;
            :roleTime ?time .
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the role and the time at which that role was recorded, showing that the competency question is modeled in the ontology.
