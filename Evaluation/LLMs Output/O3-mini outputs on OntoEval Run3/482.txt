**Yes**

A query can be written over the reified relationship instances in the ontology that capture a personâ€™s role in a band at a given time. For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves the role held by a given person in a given band at a specified time (using the reification class Cl_PersonRoleBandTime and its properties):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?role
WHERE {
  ?relation a :Cl_PersonRoleBandTime ;
            :hasPerson ?person ;
            :hasBand ?band ;
            :hasRole ?role ;
            :hasTime ?time .
  
  # Replace the following with the desired person, band and time:
  FILTER(?person = :JohnFrusciante &&
         ?band   = :RedHotChiliPeppers &&
         ?time   = "1988-01-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the ontology supports answering the competency question "What role does a certain person have in a certain band at a certain point in time?" under the closed world assumption.
