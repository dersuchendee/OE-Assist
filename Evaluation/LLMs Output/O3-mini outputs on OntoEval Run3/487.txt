**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a specific person, band, and point in time, retrieves the role held by that person in that band during that time:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?band ?roleName ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?band a :Cl_Band .

  ?person :hasMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipInBand ?band .
  ?membership :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  ?membership :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd .
  ?membership :hasRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .

  # Assume the query input time is passed as ?pointInTime.
  # For example, you may bind ?pointInTime externally or use a literal:
  FILTER( ?pointInTime >= ?membershipStart && ?pointInTime <= ?membershipEnd )
}
------------------------------------------------

In this query the following holds under the closed world assumption:

• A person’s memberships are explicitly recorded via the :hasMembership property.
• Each membership associates the person to a band via :membershipInBand.
• The time-bounds for a membership are given by :membershipStart and :membershipEnd.
• The role for that membership is indicated by the :hasRole property and its associated :roleName.

Thus, the ontology fully supports the competency question.
