**Yes**

Assuming that an album’s recording event is reified via the recording individual (e.g. a member of the class Cl_Recording, or its specialized subclass Cl_AlbumRecording) and that this recording event carries the recording period date (via the :recordingPeriod data property), we can query the ontology to retrieve the time period during which a specific album was recorded. For example, if we want to get the recording period for an album (say one whose name contains "Stadium Arcadium"), a SPARQL query under a closed‐world assumption would be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumName ?recording ?recordingPeriod
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasRecording ?recording .
  ?recording :recordingPeriod ?recordingPeriod .
  OPTIONAL { ?album :albumName ?albumName . }
  
  # Filter for a specific album, e.g., "Stadium Arcadium"
  FILTER(regex(?albumName, "Stadium Arcadium", "i"))
}
ORDER BY ?recordingPeriod

This query retrieves the album, its associated recording event and the recording period, thus answering the competency question.
