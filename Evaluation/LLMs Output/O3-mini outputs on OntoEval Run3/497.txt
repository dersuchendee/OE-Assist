**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each album, the associated recording period by following the recordedAlbum and recordingPeriod relationships:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingPeriod 
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :recordedAlbum ?albumRecording .
  ?albumRecording :recordingPeriod ?recordingPeriod .
}
--------------------------------------------------

Under the closed-world assumption—in which we expect that all time period information for an album’s recording is explicitly asserted—this query fully answers the competency question "During what time period was a certain album recorded?"
