**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves the time period during which a given album was recorded:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingPeriod
WHERE {
  ?album rdf:type :Cl_Album .
  ?album :recordedDuring ?albumRecording .
  ?albumRecording :recordingPeriod ?recordingPeriod .
}
ORDER BY ?album

This query extracts all albums with their corresponding recording period as modelled in the ontology, thus answering the CQ "During what time period was a certain album recorded?"
