**Yes**

Assuming that albums and their recording periods are modelled through the reified class •Cl_AlbumRecording• (which is both a •Cl_Album• and a •Cl_TimePeriod•) and that the relation •recordedDuring• connects an album to its recording time period, we can extract the answer with a query such as:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?recording ?timePeriod
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel. }
  ?album :recordedDuring ?recording .
  ?recording a :Cl_TimePeriod .
  BIND(?recording AS ?timePeriod)
}
ORDER BY ?album

Under the closed‐world assumption the query retrieves albums that have an explicitly stated recording time period.
