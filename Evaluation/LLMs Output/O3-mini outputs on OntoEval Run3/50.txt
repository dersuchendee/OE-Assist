**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the actors involved in each circular value network:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/circular_value_network.owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?valueNetwork ?actor ?actorLabel
WHERE {
  ?valueNetwork a :ValueNetwork ;
                :hasActor ?actor .
  OPTIONAL { ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel . }
}
-------------------------------------------------- 

This query is answerable by the ontology since the CQ targets the relationship between a circular value network (instance of ValueNetwork) and its actors (instances of Actor) via the property :hasActor, which is explicitly modeled by the ontology under the closed world assumption.
