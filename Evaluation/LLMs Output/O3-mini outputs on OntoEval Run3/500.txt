**Yes**

We can answer this CQ by retrieving for each album its recording period via the recording instance that links to the album (using the :recorded property), and the data properties :recordingStart and :recordingEnd. Assuming the closed world (i.e. only the facts explicitly stated in the ontology hold), the following SPARQL query extracts the recording period for any album:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?recording a :Cl_Recording ;
             :recorded ?album ;
             :recordingStart ?recordingStart ;
             :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
}
------------------------------------------------

This query returns each album along with the start and end dates of its recording period, thus fully supporting the competency question.
