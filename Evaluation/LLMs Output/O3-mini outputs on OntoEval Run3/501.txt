**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the album along with the start and end times of its recording period:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album rdf:type :Cl_Album .
  ?album :recordedDuring ?recording .
  ?recording :recordingStart ?recordingStart .
  ?recording :recordingEnd ?recordingEnd .
}
--------------------------------------------------

In a closed world setting, if the ontology contains all the required information (that is, every album has a recording period specified with both a start and an end date), this query fully answers the CQ “During what time period was a certain album recorded?”
