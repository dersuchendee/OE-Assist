**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the location (with its name) for the performance that took place on 2006‑08‑11 (as described in the story):

—————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate "2006-08-11T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime ;
               :tookPlaceAt ?location .
  ?location :locationName ?locationName .
}
—————————————————————————————

In this query we assume that the competency question is “What is the geographic location of the performance?” which is answerable using the provided ontology (under a closed world assumption).
