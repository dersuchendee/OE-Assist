**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world interpretation, answers the CQ “During what time period was a certain album recorded?” by retrieving the recording time for a given album (here, for example, the album StadiumArcadium):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?recordedTime
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :hasRecording ?recording .
  ?recording :recordedDuring ?recordedTime .
  FILTER(?album = :StadiumArcadium)
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the album’s identifier along with the time period during which it was recorded.
