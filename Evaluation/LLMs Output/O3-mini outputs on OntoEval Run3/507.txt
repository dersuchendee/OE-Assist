**Yes**

Based on the ontology, we can answer the competency question “During what time period was a certain album recorded?” In the ontology, an album (an instance of :Cl_Album) is linked to a recording session (an instance of :Cl_RecordingSession) through the object property :recordedDuring; and the recording session is reified with date properties—using :membershipStart (for the start date) and :membershipEnd (for the end date). Under a closed world assumption, if an album has such properties asserted, we can extract the defined time period.

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given album (optionally by filter on label or URI), its recording session’s start and end dates:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?start ?end
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  ?album :recordedDuring ?session .
  ?session :membershipStart ?start .
  ?session :membershipEnd ?end .
  # Optionally, filter on a specific album label:
  # FILTER (lcase(str(?albumLabel)) = "stadium arcadium")
}
ORDER BY ?album
--------------------------------------------------

This query will extract each album’s recording session start and end date, thereby answering the CQ under the closed world assumption.
