**Yes**

One can retrieve the recording period of an album using the association between an album and its recording session. For example, under a closed world assumption the following SPARQL query “joins” a given album to its recording session and extracts the start and end times:

───────────────────────────── 
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?recordingStart ?recordingEnd
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel. }
  
  ?album :hasRecordingSession ?session .
  ?session :recordingStartDate ?recordingStart .
  ?session :recordingEndDate ?recordingEnd .
}
───────────────────────────── 

This query shows that the competency question “During what time period was a certain album recorded?” is fully answerable using the given ontology.
