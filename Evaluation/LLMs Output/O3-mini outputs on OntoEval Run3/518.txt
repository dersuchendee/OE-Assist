**Yes**

A competency question asking “How many tracks does a particular album contain?” is answerable using the ontology since the Album class is linked to its tracks via the :hasTrack property. Under the closed world assumption, if an album does not have any tracks explicitly asserted, it is assumed to have none. Here is a SPARQL query that counts the tracks for a particular album (for example, “Stadium Arcadium”):

PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumTitle (COUNT(?track) AS ?trackCount)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Album ;
         :albumTitle ?albumTitle ;
         :hasTrack ?track .
  FILTER(?albumTitle = "Stadium Arcadium")
}
GROUP BY ?album ?albumTitle

This query retrieves the album, its title, and counts all tracks connected via the :hasTrack property.
