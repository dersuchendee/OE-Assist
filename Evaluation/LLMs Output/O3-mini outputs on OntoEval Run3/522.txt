**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, counts the number of tracks linked to each album via the “containsTracks” property. (You may filter for a particular album—e.g., by its label—if desired.)

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numberOfTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTracks ?track .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  # To filter for a particular album, uncomment and adjust the following:
  # FILTER (str(?albumLabel) = "Stadium Arcadium")
}
GROUP BY ?album
ORDER BY ?album

This query fully extracts the answer to the competency question "How many tracks does a particular album contain?" from the provided ontology.
