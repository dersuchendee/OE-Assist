**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that extracts the number of tracks recorded for each album (using the closed‚Äêworld assumption on the available data):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?numTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :numberOfTracks ?numTracks .
} 

This query returns each album instance together with its recorded number of tracks, thus fully answering the competency question.
