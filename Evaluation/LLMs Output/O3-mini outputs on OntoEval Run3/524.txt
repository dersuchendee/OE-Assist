**Yes**

You can extract the answer by querying for albums with their associated numberOfTracks. For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?numberOfTracks
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :numberOfTracks ?numberOfTracks .
}

This query retrieves each album along with its number of tracks. Under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, if the album (e.g. Stadium_Arcadium) has a asserted value (such as the value 28), then the answer is complete.
