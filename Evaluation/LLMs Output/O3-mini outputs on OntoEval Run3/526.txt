**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that answers the CQ “How many tracks does a particular album contain?” using the ontology elements provided:

—————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?album (COUNT(?track) AS ?numTracks)
WHERE {
  ?album rdf:type :Cl_Album .
  ?album :containsTrack ?track .
}
GROUP BY ?album
—————————————————————————————

This query selects each album (of type Cl_Album) and counts the number of tracks connected via the :containsTrack property, which supports the competency question under the closed world assumption.
