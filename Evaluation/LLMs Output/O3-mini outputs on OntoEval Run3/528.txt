**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the track count associated with each album (or a specific album, e.g. :StadiumArcadium):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?trackCount
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :trackCount ?trackCount .
}
ORDER BY ?album

This query shows that the ontology explicitly associates a track count (e.g. 28 for StadiumArcadium) with a given album, thereby answering the competency question.
