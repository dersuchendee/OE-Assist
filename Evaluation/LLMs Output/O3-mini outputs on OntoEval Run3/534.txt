**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each album, the associated track count (via the reified class Cl_AlbumTrackCount):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?trackCount
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  ?album :containsTracks ?albumTrackCount .
  ?albumTrackCount :trackCount ?trackCount .
}
ORDER BY ?album

This query shows that the competency question “How many tracks does a particular album contain?” is answerable using the ontology under the closed world assumption.
