**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that answers the competency question by retrieving music albums along with their release dates (using the closed world assumption):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :MusicAlbum .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel }
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
ORDER BY ?album

This query lists all albums defined in the ontology along with their labels and release dates, which models the CQ “When was a certain album released?” under the closed world assumption.
