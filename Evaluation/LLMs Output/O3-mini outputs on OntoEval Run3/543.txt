**Yes**

Assuming that an album instance is defined as a :Cl_Album and that its release information is captured by linking it via the :releasedAlbum property to an instance of :Cl_AlbumRelease that in turn has a :releaseDate (of type xsd:date), we can write a SPARQL query that retrieves the release date for a specified album. Under the closed world assumption, only explicitly asserted information is considered.

For example, if you wish to get the release date for a certain album (e.g. identified by its URI), you could use the following query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releasedAlbum ?albumRelease .
  ?albumRelease :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  # Optionally, restrict to a specific album:
  # FILTER(?album = <http://www.example.org/test#StadiumArcadium>)
}

This query shows that the competency question “When was a certain album released?” is fully modelled by the ontology.
