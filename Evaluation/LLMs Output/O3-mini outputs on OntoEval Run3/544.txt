**Yes**  
Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves each album’s release date by following the reified structure of album releases in the ontology:

------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releasedOn ?albumRelease .
  ?albumRelease :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
------------------------------------

This query assumes that album instances (of type Cl_Album) are linked via the property releasedOn to an instance of Cl_AlbumRelease, which in turn has the property releaseDate supplying the release date. This models the competency question “When was a certain album released?” using the reification provided by the ontology.
