**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, returns the release date of albums (for example, the album “Stadium_Arcadium”):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology models the competency question “When was a certain album released?” because we can extract the release date of albums from the ontology.
