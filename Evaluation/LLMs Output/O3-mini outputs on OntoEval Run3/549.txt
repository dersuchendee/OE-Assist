**Yes**

The following SPARQL query can be used (under the closed‐world assumption) to extract the release date of albums (e.g. the “Stadium_Arcadium” album) from the ontology:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves those albums along with their release dates, thus answering the competency question “When was a certain album released?” using the provided ontology.
