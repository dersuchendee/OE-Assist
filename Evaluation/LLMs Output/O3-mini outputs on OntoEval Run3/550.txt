**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that uses the ontology’s classes and properties to retrieve the song (derived from a track of the album "StadiumArcadium") along with the region in which that song was performed. In this query we first obtain the tracks contained in the album via the property “:containsTrack”, then “reify” the song behind a track using the “:recordingOf” relation. Next, we link to the performance data via instances of “:Cl_PerformanceSong” and then follow the “:tookPlaceAt” property (which points to a city) and finally use “:locatedIn” to retrieve the region. The query aggregates the number of performances per song in each region to help understand how the tracks vary (for example in frequency) by region.

This query will return, for each song from the album, the region in which the song was performed and the number of performances – providing a view of how the tracks "vary" by region.
