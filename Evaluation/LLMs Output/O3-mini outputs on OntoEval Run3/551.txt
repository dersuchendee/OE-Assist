**Yes**

A competency question like “When was a certain album released?” can be answered via this ontology because albums (instances of :Cl_Album) are annotated with a data property (:releaseDate). For example, to retrieve the release date for the “Stadium Arcadium” album, you could run:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  FILTER(?album = :StadiumArcadium)
}
---------------------------------

This query extracts the release date directly from the ontology, so the CQ is fully supported.
