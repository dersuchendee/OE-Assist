SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  
  # If you wish to restrict to a specific album (e.g., "Stadium Arcadium"), you could add:
  # ?album rdfs:label "Stadium Arcadium" .
}
```

This query retrieves the release date for albums (instances of :Cl_Album), which fully addresses the competency question "When was a certain album released?" under the closed world assumption.
