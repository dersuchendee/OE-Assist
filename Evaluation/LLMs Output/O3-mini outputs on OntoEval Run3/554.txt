**Yes**

We can answer this CQ by querying for albums and their release dates (using the :releaseDate property defined for :Cl_Album). Under the closed world assumption, we assume that if a :releaseDate isnâ€™t explicitly given, then no release date exists. The following SPARQL query returns albums together with the dates when they were released:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  ?album :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
}
