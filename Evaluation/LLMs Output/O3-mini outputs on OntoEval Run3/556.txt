**Yes**
Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves an albumâ€™s release date from the ontology:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?releaseDate
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album ;
         :releaseDate ?releaseDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  # You may add a filter to specify which album, for example:
  # FILTER(langMatches(lang(?albumLabel),"EN") && ?albumLabel = "Stadium Arcadium")
}
------------------------------------------------

Under the Closed World Assumption and given that the ontology declares a datatype property :releaseDate with domain :Cl_Album (that is, every album has a release date), we can answer the competency question "When was a certain album released?" using this query.
