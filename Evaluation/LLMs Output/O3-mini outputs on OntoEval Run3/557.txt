Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves albums along with their release dates. In this ontology, albums are modelled as instances of Cl_Album, and the release information is associated via the property releasedOn (with range Cl_AlbumRelease) that carries the releaseDate data property.

This query extracts the release date for every album, thereby answering the competency question “When was a certain album released?” under the closed world assumption.
