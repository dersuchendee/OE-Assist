**Yes**

Assuming that “a specific track” is given (for example, ns1:HumpDeBump) and knowing that in this ontology a track is modelled as an individual that is both a ns1:Track and a ns1:Song (as in the case of ns1:HumpDeBump), we can answer the CQ. Under the closed‐world assumption we expect that every track that is a recording of a song is explicitly asserted (here via its dual typing) or linked from an album via ns1:hasTrack.

Below is an example SPARQL query that—given a specific track (here ns1:HumpDeBump)—extracts the song (its label) that the track is a recording of:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?track ?trackLabel
WHERE {
  # Find the track from an album via the hasTrack relation
  ?album ns1:hasTrack ?track .
  # Assert that the track is modelled as a Song (i.e. the creative musical work)
  ?track a ns1:Song .
  OPTIONAL { ?track rdfs:label ?trackLabel . }
  # Specific track filter; replace ns1:HumpDeBump with the desired track URI.
  FILTER(?track = ns1:HumpDeBump)
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that for a given track, here ns1:HumpDeBump, we can extract its label and thereby answer “What song is a specific track a recording of?”
