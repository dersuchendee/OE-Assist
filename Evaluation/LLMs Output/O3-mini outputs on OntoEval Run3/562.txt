**Yes**

We can extract the song associated with a given music track by querying for a MusicTrack, following its :isMusicTrackOf relation to a Recording and then following the :isRecordingOf relation to the Song. For example, the following SPARQL query returns, for each track, the song it is a recording of:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?track ?trackLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?track a :MusicTrack .
  OPTIONAL { ?track rdfs:label ?trackLabel . }
  
  ?track :isMusicTrackOf ?recording .
  ?recording :isRecordingOf ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
-------------------------------------------------

Under a closed world assumption, we assume that the missing links indicate absence of the association, and this query returns the complete answer to the CQ.
