**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a specific track, retrieves the song that the track is a recording of:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?track ?trackTitle ?song ?songTitle
WHERE {
  ?track a :Track .
  ?track :trackTitle ?trackTitle .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?song .
  ?song :songTitle ?songTitle .
  # To restrict to a specific track, uncomment and adjust the following FILTER:
  # FILTER(?track = :HumpDeBump_Track)
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query, the property :isRecordingOf connects a Track to the Song it is a recording of, so the CQ is fully answerable by the ontology.
