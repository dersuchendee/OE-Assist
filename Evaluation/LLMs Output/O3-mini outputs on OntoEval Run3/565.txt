**Yes**

We can answer the CQ with the following SPARQL query. Notice that the ontology includes a reified “track recording” class (Cl_TrackRecording, a subclass of Cl_Track) and the object property :hasSong linking a track recording to a song. This allows us – under the closed world assumption – to extract which song a given track (of type Cl_TrackRecording) is a recording of.

For example:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?track ?trackName ?song ?songName
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_TrackRecording .
  OPTIONAL { ?track :trackName ?trackName . }
  ?track :hasSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song :songName ?songName . }
}

This query retrieves tracks of type Cl_TrackRecording, their optional names, and the associated song (with its name) recorded by that track.
