**Yes**

Below is one valid SPARQL query that, given a specific track, returns the song that the track is a recording of:

---------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>

SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?trackRecording .
  ?trackRecording :recordedSong ?song .
  FILTER (?track = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificTrack>)
}
---------------------------------------------------

In this query we assume that the specific track is identified by the URI <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificTrack>. This query uses the reification pattern provided by the ontology, where a Cl_Track resource is linked via the :isRecordingOf property to an intermediate Cl_TrackRecording instance, which in turn is connected via :recordedSong to the corresponding Cl_Song.
