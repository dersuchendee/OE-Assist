**Yes**

Assuming the ontology contains individuals that are instances of :Cl_Track, and tracks “record” a song via an intermediate recording instance (using the object properties :recordingOf and :songRecorded), a SPARQL query to answer “What song is a specific track a recording of?” could be:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track ;
         :recordingOf ?rec .
  ?song :songRecorded ?rec .
  # Use a filter or bound value to select a specific track if needed, e.g.:
  # FILTER(?track = <http://www.example.org/test#SpecificTrackIRI>)
}

This query, under a closed‐world assumption (only explicitly given individuals and properties are considered), retrieves the song that the specified track is a recording of.
