**Yes**

Assuming the specific track is identified by a URI (for example, :SpecificTrack), we can retrieve the song that the track is a recording of by following the reified connection. In this ontology, a track (instance of :Cl_Track) is linked via the property :isRecordingOf to an instance of :Cl_TrackRecording, and a song (instance of :Cl_Song) is linked via the inverse property :hasRecording to that same recording.

A SPARQL query that answers the CQ is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  :SpecificTrack :isRecordingOf ?recording .
  ?song :hasRecording ?recording .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel }
}

This query returns the song (and its label, if available) that the specific track (i.e. :SpecificTrack) is a recording of.
