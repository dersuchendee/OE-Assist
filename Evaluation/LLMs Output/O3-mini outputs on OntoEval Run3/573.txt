**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that returns, for every track in the ontology, the song that it is a recording of:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track ;
         :recordingOf ?song .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology explicitly asserts (via the “:recordingOf” property) which song a given track is a recording of, thereby supporting the competency question.
