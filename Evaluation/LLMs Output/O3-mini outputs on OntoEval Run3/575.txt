**Yes**

Assuming that a “specific track” is identified (for example, by its URI or a parameter), you can write a SPARQL query that retrieves the song recorded by that track via the :trackOf property. For example:

-------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?track ?song
WHERE {
  ?track rdf:type :Cl_Track .
  ?track :trackOf ?song .
  # Replace :SpecificTrack with the URI of the specific track you are interested in:
  FILTER(?track = :SpecificTrack)
}
-------------------------

This query uses the ontology’s declaration that a track (of type :Cl_Track) is connected to a song (of type :Cl_Song) by the :trackOf property, thus fully answering the competency question under a closed world assumption.
