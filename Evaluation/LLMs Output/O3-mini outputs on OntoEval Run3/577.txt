**Yes**

We can answer the CQ because the ontology contains a direct relationship between a track (an instance of :Cl_Track) and the song it is a recording of (an instance of :Cl_Song) via the property :isRecordingOf. Under the closed world assumption, given a specific track, we can query the ontology to retrieve the song that the track is a recording of.

For example, assuming you have the URI of the specific track (here represented as <SPECIFIC_TRACK_URI>), the following SPARQL query will extract the song:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?track ?trackLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?track a :Cl_Track .
  OPTIONAL { ?track rdfs:label ?trackLabel . }
  ?track :isRecordingOf ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  FILTER(?track = <SPECIFIC_TRACK_URI>)
}

This query returns the track details and the corresponding song it recorded, fulfilling the competency question.
