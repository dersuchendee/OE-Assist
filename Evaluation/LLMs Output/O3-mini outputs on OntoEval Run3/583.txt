**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world interpretation, retrieves the composition date for a given song. (Here we assume that songs are modeled as instances of the class :Cl_Song and that their composition is reified using a composition event linked by :op_composedDuring to which the date is attached via the data property :dp_compositionDate.)

SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song ;
        :op_composedDuring ?compEvent .
  ?compEvent :dp_compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
ORDER BY ?song

This query answers the competency question “When was a certain song composed?” by extracting the composition date (stored in composition events) for each song in the ontology.
