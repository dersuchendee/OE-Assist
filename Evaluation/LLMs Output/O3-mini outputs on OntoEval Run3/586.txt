**Yes**

Assuming that a “certain song” is linked to an instance of Cl_Composition (via the object property composition_song) and that the composition event date is stored via the datatype property composition_date, we can extract the composition date with a SPARQL query. For example, a parameterized query may be written as follows:

---------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?comp a :Cl_Composition .
  ?comp :composition_song ?song .
  ?comp :composition_date ?compositionDate .
  # Optionally, filter on a specific song label:
  # ?song rdfs:label "Song Title" .
}
---------------------------------------------

This query is answerable under the closed world assumption as all necessary classes and properties (Cl_Composition, composition_song, and composition_date) are available in the ontology.
