**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption on the ontology, extracts the composition date for a specified song (in this case “Hump de Bump”):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Song ;
        :songTitle "Hump de Bump" ;
        :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology does indeed model the competency question "When was a certain song composed?" by providing a Song class with a compositionDate property.
