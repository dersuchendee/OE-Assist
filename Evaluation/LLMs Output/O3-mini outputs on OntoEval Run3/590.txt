**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that extracts—for a given song—the date it was composed, as modelled by the ontology:

—————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?songLabel ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  
  ?song :composedOn ?songComposition .
  ?songComposition :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
}
—————————————————————————————

Under the closed world assumption, if no composition date is explicitly recorded for a given song, then it is considered not composed (or unknown) in the dataset. This query demonstrates that the competency question “When was a certain song composed?” is indeed answerable using the ontology.
