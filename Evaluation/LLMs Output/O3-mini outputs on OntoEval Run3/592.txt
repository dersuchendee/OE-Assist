**Yes**

We can answer the query “When was a certain song composed?” using this ontology since songs are modelled with the class Cl_Song and the data property composedOn. For example, to get the composition date(s) for a given song (e.g., “Hump_de_Bump”), you could use the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?composedOn
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song ;
        :composedOn ?composedOn .
  FILTER(?song = :Hump_de_Bump)
}

This query returns the composition date for the song in question by filtering the song individual “Hump_de_Bump”.
