**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that retrieves the composition date for a specific song (here filtering by the song “Hump_de_Bump”):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?song ?composedOn
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :composedOn ?composedOn .
  FILTER(regex(str(?song), "Hump_de_Bump", "i"))
}

This query works under the closed world assumption and extracts the answer to the CQ “When was a certain song composed?” by retrieving the date associated with the property :composedOn.
