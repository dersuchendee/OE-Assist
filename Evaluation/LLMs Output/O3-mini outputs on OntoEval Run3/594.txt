**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the composition date of a given song (in this case “HumpDeBump”):

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?compositionDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :compositionDate ?compositionDate .
  FILTER(?song = :HumpDeBump)
}
---------------------------------

This query answers the competency question “When was a certain song composed?” by extracting the composition date for the song individual “HumpDeBump” from the ontology, under the closed world assumption.
