**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that joins the performance, its location and the hierarchical location information (city, region and country) to answer a competency question such as “Where was the performance of the track ‘HumpDeBump’ (from the album StadiumArcadium) held?” This query uses the modeled classes and properties (e.g. Cl_Performance, tookPlaceAt, locatedIn, regionInCountry) to extract the performance date and location information:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?city ?cityName ?region ?regionName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate ;
               :tookPlaceAt ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city :locationName ?cityName. }
  
  OPTIONAL {
    ?city :locatedIn ?region .
    OPTIONAL { ?region :locationName ?regionName. }
    OPTIONAL {
      ?region :regionInCountry ?country .
      OPTIONAL { ?country :locationName ?countryName. }
    }
  }
  
  ?perfSong a :Cl_PerformanceSong ;
            :performedIn ?performance;
            :performedSong :HumpDeBump .
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query:
• We select each performance (that has a performance date) where the performance song instance links the performance with the song :HumpDeBump.
• The performance’s location (modeled as a city) is retrieved along with its name.
• Further optional patterns drill down to the region (via :locatedIn) and the country (via :regionInCountry) and get their names.
• This fully exploits the ontology’s modeling of location for a performance and answers the CQ.

Thus, the competency question is well‐modeled by the ontology.
