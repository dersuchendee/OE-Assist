**Yes**

We can answer the CQ “When was a certain song composed?” using the ontology because a song is modelled as an instance of Cl_Song and its composition date is captured by the data property :composedOn (whose range is xsd:date).

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the composition date for a song whose name we know (e.g., “Hump de Bump”):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?song ?songLabel ?composedOn
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  ?song :composedOn ?composedOn .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
  FILTER(?songLabel = "Hump de Bump")
}
--------------------------------------------------

If you want to retrieve the composition dates for all songs, you can remove or adjust the FILTER clause.
