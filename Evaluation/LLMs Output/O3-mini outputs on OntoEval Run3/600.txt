**Yes**

Assuming that songs are modelled as individuals of the class :Cl_Song and their composition dates are defined by the data property :composedDate, the CQ “When was a certain song composed?” can be fully answered by the ontology. Under the closed world assumption we can retrieve the composition date for songs.

A sample SPARQL query is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?song ?songLabel ?composedDate
WHERE {
  ?song a :Cl_Song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel. }
  ?song :composedDate ?composedDate .
}
