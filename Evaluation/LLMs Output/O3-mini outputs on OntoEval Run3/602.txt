Even though the ontology contains the class for songs (:Cl_Song) and a data property for the composed date (:composedDate), there isn’t a reified construct (i.e. a dedicated reification class linking all relevant aspects) that fully captures the CQ “When was a certain song composed?” under the intended reification pattern. Under the closed‐world assumption, we can only extract a partial answer directly via the property attached to the song.
