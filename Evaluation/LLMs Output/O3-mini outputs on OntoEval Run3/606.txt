**Yes**
Below is one example SPARQL query assuming that the review relation is reified (with a reification class linking an album to a critic’s review) so that we can extract what a given critic said about a given record.

For instance, if the reification is modeled by an instance of a review class (here assumed to be connected via the properties :reviewedBy, :hasCritic, and :hasReview), then the query can be written as follows:

—————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumName ?review
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
  OPTIONAL { ?album :hasName ?albumName . }
  
  ?album :reviewedBy ?reviewInstance .
  ?reviewInstance :hasCritic :CrianHiatt .
  ?reviewInstance :hasReview ?review .
  
  # Optionally, restrict to a specific album if needed:
  # FILTER(?album = :StadiumArcadium)
}
—————————————————————————————

In this query the reified review instance connects the album (record) with its review given by a critic (here :CrianHiatt). Therefore the CQ “What does a certain critic say about a certain record?” is supported by the ontology under the closed world assumption.
