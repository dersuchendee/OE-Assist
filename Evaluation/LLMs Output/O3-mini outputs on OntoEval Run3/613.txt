**No**

The ontology does not explicitly model reviews of “records” – instead, reviews are associated with albums (using the class Cl_CriticReview, which is defined as a subclass of Cl_Critic, Cl_Album, and Cl_Review). Under the closed‐world assumption, since there is no link between a critic’s review and a “record” (as distinct from an album or other release), we can only extract a partial answer (that is, information on what critics say about albums).

A partial SPARQL query to extract a critic’s review on an album (as a proxy for “record”) is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?critic ?album ?reviewText
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_CriticReview ;
          :reviewText ?reviewText ;
          :reviewedAlbum ?album .
  ?critic :reviews ?review .
}

This query retrieves critics, the albums they reviewed, and the associated review texts – which is only a partial answer to “What does a certain critic say about a certain record?” because the ontology does not relate critics directly to records.
