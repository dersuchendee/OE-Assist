**Yes**

Assuming we want to extract the critique given by a specific critic (e.g. :Crian_Hiatt) about a specific record (e.g. :Stadium_Arcadium), here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the critique text:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?critic ?record ?critiqueText
WHERE {
  ?critic a :Cl_Critic .
  ?record a :Cl_Album .
  ?critique a :Cl_Critique .
  
  ?critic :madeCritique ?critique .
  ?critique :critiqueOf ?record .
  ?critique :critiqueText ?critiqueText .
  
  # Filter for a specific critic and record (using closed world assumption, only data in the ontology)
  FILTER(?critic = :Crian_Hiatt && ?record = :Stadium_Arcadium)
}
------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology indeed supports the competency question “What does a certain critic say about a certain record?” by allowing extraction of the critique text made by the critic about the record.
