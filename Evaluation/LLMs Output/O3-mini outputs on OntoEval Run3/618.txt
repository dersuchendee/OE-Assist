**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that “asks” the CQ – it retrieves the record (album), its associated review text, and the critic who provided that review. You could optionally restrict the query to a specific critic or record by adding additional FILTER clauses.

SELECT ?record ?recordLabel ?critic ?criticLabel ?reviewText 
WHERE {
  ?review a :Cl_Review ;
          :reviewedBy ?critic ;
          :reviewOf ?record ;
          :reviewText ?reviewText .
  OPTIONAL { ?record rdfs:label ?recordLabel. }
  OPTIONAL { ?critic rdfs:label ?criticLabel. }
}

This query extracts the album (record) that was reviewed, the critic who reviewed it, and the content of the review, which answers the competency question “What does a certain critic say about a certain record?” under the closed world assumption of the provided ontology.
