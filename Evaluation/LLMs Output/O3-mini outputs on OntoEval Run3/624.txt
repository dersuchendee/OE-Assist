Below is an example SPARQL query that uses the review-related classes and properties to extract what a given critic (e.g. represented by the individual :CrianHiatt) has said about a specific record (album):

---------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?album ?albumLabel ?review ?reviewContent
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  OPTIONAL { ?album rdfs:label ?albumLabel . }
  
  ?album :hasReview ?review .
  ?review :writtenBy ?critic .
  ?review :reviewContent ?reviewContent .
  
  # Filter for the specific critic (replace :CrianHiatt with the appropriate individual)
  FILTER(?critic = :CrianHiatt)
}
---------------------------------------------------

This query returns all albums (records) along with their reviews written by the critic :CrianHiatt and the content of those reviews.
