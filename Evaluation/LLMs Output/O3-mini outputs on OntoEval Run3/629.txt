**Yes**
Below is one example SPARQL query that retrieves the performance date for performance events (using the reified performance event class):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_PerformanceEvent ;
               :hasPerformanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate

This query extracts, for each instance of Cl_PerformanceEvent, the associated performance date—thus answering the competency question "When did a certain performance take place?" under a closed‐world assumption.
