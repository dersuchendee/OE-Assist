**Yes**

We can answer this CQ because the ontology includes a class for performance events (Cl_PerformanceEvent) and a property (hasDate) to record the date of the performance. Under the closed world assumption, if a performance instance exists with a date, its occurrence can be extracted using the following SPARQL query:

------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_PerformanceEvent .
  ?performance :hasDate ?date .
}
------------------------------

This query retrieves each performance event along with the date it took place, thus fully modeling the competency question "When did a certain performance take place?"
