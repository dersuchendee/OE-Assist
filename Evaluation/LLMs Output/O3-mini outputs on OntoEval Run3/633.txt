**Yes**

The ontology includes a Performance class with an associated TimeInterval (using properties such as hasTimeInterval, startDate, and endDate), so we can write a SPARQL query that—for a given performance—retrieves its time interval (i.e. when it took place). For example:

  PREFIX : <http://example.org/music#>  
  PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>  
    
  SELECT ?performance ?startDate ?endDate  
  WHERE {  
    ?performance a :Performance ;  
                 :hasTimeInterval ?interval .  
    ?interval :startDate ?startDate ;  
              :endDate ?endDate .  
  }  

This query returns the performance(s) and their corresponding start and end dates, thus answering the competency question under the closed world assumption.
