**Yes**

We can answer this CQ using the ontology since it explicitly defines a performance class (Cl_Performance) and a property (performanceDate) that links each performance to its date. Under the closed world assumption, we expect every instance of Cl_Performance that is relevant to have a performanceDate value.

A suitable SPARQL query is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
} 

This query retrieves each performance and the date on which it took place, thus fully addressing the CQ.
