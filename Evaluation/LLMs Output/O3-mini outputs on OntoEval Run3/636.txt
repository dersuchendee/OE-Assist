**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that extracts performance instances (using the reified class for band performance) along with the date the performance took place:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_BandPerformance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate
--------------------------------------------------

Under the closed‐world assumption, this query retrieves the dates for all recorded performances modeled by the ontology, thus satisfying the competency question “When did a certain performance take place?”
