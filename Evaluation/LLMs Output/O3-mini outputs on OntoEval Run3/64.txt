**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a specific resource (for instance, :GlassBottle), retrieves all its asserted types (rdf:type):

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology/recycling#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?resource ?type
WHERE {
  VALUES ?resource { :GlassBottle }   # Replace :GlassBottle with the specific resource as needed
  ?resource rdf:type ?type .
}
----------------------------------

This query extracts the types directly declared for the resource, making use of the closed world assumption on the provided ontology.
