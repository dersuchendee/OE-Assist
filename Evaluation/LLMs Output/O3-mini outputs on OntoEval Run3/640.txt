**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves performances along with the date they took place:

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
---------------------------------

In a closed‚Äêworld interpretation, only those individuals explicitly stated as instances of :Cl_Performance and with the data property :performanceDate will be returned, which meets the competency question "When did a certain performance take place?"
