**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query to retrieve the date of each performance (using the property “performanceDate” defined on instances of Cl_Performance):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?date
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?date .
}
ORDER BY ?date
--------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the CQ “When did a certain performance take place?” can be answered using the ontology as the performance date is explicitly modelled by the property :performanceDate on performances.
