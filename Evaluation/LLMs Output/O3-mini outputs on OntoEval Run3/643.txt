**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the performance (of type Cl_Performance) along with its performance date:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate
------------------------------------------------

This query assumes a closed‚Äêworld interpretation by selecting those individuals explicitly asserted as a Cl_Performance and having an associated :performanceDate.
