**Yes**

Assuming that each performance is modelled as an instance of :Cl_Performance and the date of the performance is recorded with the property :performanceDate, you can answer the CQ “When did a certain performance take place?” by retrieving the date associated with a performance instance. The following SPARQL query extracts the performance and its date under the closed world assumption:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate

This query will return all performance instances and the dates on which they took place, thereby satisfying the CQ.
