```sparql
SELECT ?performance ?dateTime
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performedDuring ?dateTime .
}
```

This query retrieves the date and time at which any performance (i.e. an instance of :Cl_Performance) took place, based on the property :performedDuring defined in the ontology under the closed world assumption.
