**Yes**

We can answer this CQ using the ontology because it includes a class for performances (Cl_Performance) together with a data property (performanceDate) that records when a performance takes place.

A possible SPARQL query under the closed world assumption is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
}
