**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the date of a given performance by navigating from the performance reification to its associated performance date.

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedOn ?perfDateNode .
  ?perfDateNode :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
  # You can add a FILTER here to select a specific performance if needed.
}
------------------------------------------------------------

In the query, we assume that performances are instances of :Cl_Performance and that the date information is reified via a :Cl_PerformanceDate instance (linked by the property :performedOn) which carries the actual date value connected via the data property :performanceDate. With the closed world assumption, if the performance instance has its date defined according to this pattern, the query will return the answer to “When did a certain performance take place?”
