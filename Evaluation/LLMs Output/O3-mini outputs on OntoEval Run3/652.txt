**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that extracts the songs played in a given performance (using a reification class that connects the performance with the played song):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?perfDate ?song ?songTitle
WHERE {
  # The reified association that relates a performance and a song played
  ?perfSong a :Cl_PerformanceSong ;
            :performanceOf ?performance ;
            :songPlayed ?song .
  
  # Optionally retrieve song title and performance date
  OPTIONAL { ?song :hasTitle ?songTitle . }
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :hasPerformanceDate ?perfDate . }
  
  # Example: restrict to a certain performance (e.g., by its known URI)
  FILTER(?performance = :PortlandPerformance)
}
ORDER BY ?songTitle
------------------------------------------------

In this query we assume that the performance of interest (for instance, the live performance in Portland) is identified by :PortlandPerformance. The query uses the reification class (:Cl_PerformanceSong) to “model” the fact that a song was played in that particular performance, so the CQ is fully answerable via the ontology.
