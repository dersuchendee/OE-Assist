**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that answers the CQ by retrieving, for a given performance, the songs that were played:

───────────────────────────

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  # Assume ?performance is the specific performance instance you want to investigate
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .

  # The class Cl_SongPerformance reifies the played song event
  ?songPerformance a :Cl_SongPerformance ;
                   :performedAt ?performance ;
                   :performedSong ?song .

  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }

  # Uncomment and adjust the following FILTER to focus on a certain performance by its IRI if needed
  # FILTER(?performance = <http://www.example.org/test#YourPerformanceIRI>)
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song

───────────────────────────

Under the closed world assumption, since the ontology explicitly connects performances (via :Cl_Performance) with a reified song performance element (:Cl_SongPerformance) that in turn links to the song (:Cl_Song) via :performedSong, this CQ is fully modeled by the ontology.
