Below is one SPARQL query that exploits the reification modeled in the ontology. In this example we assume that a performance is represented by an instance of Cl_Performance and that the relationship between a performance and its songs is captured by the property playedSong (from a performance to a reified performance–song object) and by the property songPlayed (linking a song to that reified performance–song instance):

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :playedSong ?perfSong ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate .
  ?song a :Cl_Song ;
        :songPlayed ?perfSong .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?performanceDate

This query retrieves, for each performance, the date of the performance and the songs played during that performance.
