Below is one SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the songs played in a particular performance by following the reified connection provided by the ontology:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  
  ?performance :hasSong ?perfSong .
  ?perfSong a :Cl_PerformanceSong ;
            :playedInPerformance ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query extracts each performance along with its associated performance song instance and then retrieves the song that was played in that performance.
