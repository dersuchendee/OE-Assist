Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the songs played in each performance by first linking a performance to its setlist and then obtaining the songs included:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?song ?songLabel 
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel. }
  
  ?setlist a :Cl_PerformanceSetlist ;
           :performedDuring ?performance ;
           :includesSong ?song .
  
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel. }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song
