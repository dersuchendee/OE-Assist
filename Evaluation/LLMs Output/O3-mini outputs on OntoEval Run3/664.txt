**Yes**
Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each performance, its date along with its location (city, region and country) under a closed‐world assumption:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?city ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate ;
               :performanceLocation ?city .
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City ;
        :locatedInRegion ?region .
  ?region :locatedInCountry ?country .
}
ORDER BY ?performance

This query shows that the ontology fully supports the competency question (via extracting a performance’s location details).
