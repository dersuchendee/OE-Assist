**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that returns the songs performed in a given performance (for example, “Performance1”) using the ontology’s modeling of Performance, PerformanceSong, and Song entities:

------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?song ?songCompositionDate
WHERE {
  ?ps a :Cl_PerformanceSong ;
      :performedIn ?performance ;
      :performedSong ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song :compositionDate ?songCompositionDate . }
  FILTER(?performance = :Performance1)
}
------------------------------------------------------------------

This query leverages the reified structure of performance songs to extract the songs played in a specific performance, thereby demonstrating that the competency question “What songs were played in a certain performance?” is modeled by the ontology.
