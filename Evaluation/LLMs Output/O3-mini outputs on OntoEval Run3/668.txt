**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for each performance (i.e. an instance of the reified Cl_Performance) the songs played (via the properties “includesSong” and “songPerformed”):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?song ?songLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :includesSong ?performedSong .
  ?performedSong :songPerformed ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?song rdfs:label ?songLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance ?song
------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question “What songs were played in a certain performance?” as it provides a reified connection from a performance to the songs played.
