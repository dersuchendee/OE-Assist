**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves, for each performance, the songs that were played (using the :performedSongs property):

-------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?song
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedSongs ?song .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :performedOn ?performanceDate . }
}
ORDER BY ?performance
-------------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology contains a class for Performance (Cl_Performance) and an object property :performedSongs linking a performance to songs (instances of Cl_Song), which fully supports the competency question "What songs were played in a certain performance?" under a closed world assumption.
