**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves each performance and the location where it took place, based on the ontology’s classes and properties (using the closed world assumption):

--------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance rdf:type :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :takesPlaceAt ?location .
}
--------------------------------

This query shows that the CQ “Where did a certain performance take place?” is answerable from the ontology.
