**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves each performance (of type Cl_Performance) along with the location where it took place (using the property tookPlaceAt):

----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }

  ?performance :tookPlaceAt ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}
----------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology models the competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" by linking performances to their location via the property tookPlaceAt.
