**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves performances and their locations:

----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  ?performance :performedIn ?location .
}
----------------------------------------------

This query assumes that the ontology uses the property :performedIn to indicate where a performance occurred (for example, as shown by :Performance_Portland having :performedIn :Portland_Oregon).
