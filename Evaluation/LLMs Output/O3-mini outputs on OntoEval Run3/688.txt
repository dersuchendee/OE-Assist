**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the performance date along with the location where the performance took place (using the classes and properties defined in the ontology):

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?location ?locationName
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceDate ?performanceDate ;
               :tookPlaceAt ?location .
  ?location :locationName ?locationName .
}
ORDER BY ?performanceDate
-------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, the query will return only those performance instances for which the location is explicitly stated in the data.
