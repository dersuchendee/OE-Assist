**Yes**

The ontology provides a Cl_Performance class and a :hasLocation property (linking a performance to a Cl_Location, with further location details available via properties such as :isLocatedIn and :isPartOf). Under the closed‐world assumption, we can query for performances and retrieve their associated locations.

For example, the following SPARQL query returns each performance’s identifier (and optionally its performance date if available) along with its immediate location:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceDate ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :hasLocation ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance :performanceDate ?performanceDate . }
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}

This query demonstrates how the competency question “Where did a certain performance take place?” is answerable using the ontology.
