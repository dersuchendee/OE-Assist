**Yes**

Assuming the ontology follows the closed world assumption and that every performance is associated—when available—with its location, we can write a SPARQL query to directly retrieve the location for each performance. For example:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance ;
               :performanceLocation ?location .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query returns each performance and its corresponding location, directly answering the CQ “Where did a certain performance take place?”
