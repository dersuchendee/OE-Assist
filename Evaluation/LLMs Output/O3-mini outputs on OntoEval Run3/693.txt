**Yes**

The ontology includes the property :performanceLocation (with domain :Cl_PerformanceParticipation) which allows us to link a performance participation (reifying a performance event) to the location where the performance took place. This enables us to write a SPARQL query to answer the competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" under a closed world assumption.

An example SPARQL query is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?performance ?location
WHERE {
  ?participation a :Cl_PerformanceParticipation .
  ?participation :performance ?performance .
  ?participation :performanceLocation ?location .
}
ORDER BY ?performance

This query retrieves each performance and its corresponding location according to the ontologyâ€™s definitions.
