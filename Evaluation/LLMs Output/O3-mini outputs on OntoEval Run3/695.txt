**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the performance and its location using the provided ontology:

----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?performance ?performanceLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?performance a :Cl_Performance .
  OPTIONAL { ?performance rdfs:label ?performanceLabel . }
  
  ?performance :performedAt ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel . }
}
----------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question "Where did a certain performance take place?" by extracting the performance instances along with their associated location via the :performedAt property using a closed world assumption.
