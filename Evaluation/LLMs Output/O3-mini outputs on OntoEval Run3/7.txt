**No**

The CQ asks: "Which is the context of production of a source?" However, the provided ontology does not define any property linking the class :Source to the class :ContextOfProduction (or any similar construct). Although there is a relation between :Organ and :ContextOfProduction via :hasContextOfProduction, there is no modeled connection between a source and its context of production. Therefore, we can only produce a partial answer by retrieving sources (and, where available, any connection via a non‚Äêexisting property).

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves all :Source instances and, if by chance any triple exists using a property (e.g. :hasContextOfProduction) even though it is not defined in the ontology for :Source, it will show the context details. This query thus provides a partial answer under a closed-world assumption:

    OPTIONAL { ?context :hasProductionLocation ?location . }
    OPTIONAL { ?context :hasProductionTime ?time . }

  }
}

Since the ontology lacks the necessary connection, the CQ cannot be fully answered using the current model.
