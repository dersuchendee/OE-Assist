**Yes**

Assuming that individual cities are instances of :Cl_City and the ontology links a city to its region through an intermediate class—for instance, a city is associated with a “city region” via the property :cityRegion, and that “city region” is then linked to the actual region via the property :regionOfCity—the following SPARQL query answers the CQ:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?region ?regionLabel
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }

  ?city :cityRegion ?cityRegion .
  ?cityRegion :regionOfCity ?region .
  OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionLabel . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves each city along with the region (through its associated “city region”) in which that city is located.
