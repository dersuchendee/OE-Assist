**No**

The ontology does not model the location information through a reified construct. However, you can still retrieve a partial answer (using the closed world assumption) by directly querying the triples that link a city to its region as follows:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedInRegion ?cityRegion .
  ?cityRegion a :Cl_Region .
  BIND(?cityRegion AS ?region)
}

This query returns the cities and their associated region (via the intermediary class Cl_CityRegion).
