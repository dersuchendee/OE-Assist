**Yes**

We can answer the CQ using the ontology. Under the closed world assumption the ontology explicitly states that cities (instances of Cl_City) are linked to regions (instances of Cl_Region) via the property locatedIn. For instance, in our ontology we have that :Portland (a Cl_City) is located in :Oregon (a Cl_Region).

A SPARQL query to extract the region for a particular city (or all cities) could be:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?region .
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query returns, for each city in the ontology, the region where it is located.
