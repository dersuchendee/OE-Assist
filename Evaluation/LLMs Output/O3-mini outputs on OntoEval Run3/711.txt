**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each city, its name together with the region in which it is located (using the closed‐world assumption based on the ontology):

—————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityName ?region ?regionName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :locationName ?cityName .
  ?city :locatedIn ?region .
  ?region :locationName ?regionName .
}
—————————————————————————————

This query shows that the ontology explicitly models cities, regions, and the relationship (:locatedIn) between them, so the competency question is answerable through such a query.
