**Yes**

Below is a suitable SPARQL query that retrieves—for a given city—the region in which it is located (i.e. by following the :isLocatedIn property):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?region .
}

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question "In what region is a certain city located?" under the closed world assumption.
