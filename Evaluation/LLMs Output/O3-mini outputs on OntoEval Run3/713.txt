**Yes**

Assuming that individuals in the ontology are explicitly asserted—i.e. under closed world assumptions—it is possible to retrieve the region for a given city via the property that connects cities to regions. For example, if the target city is identified (e.g., by its URI), the following query extracts its associated region:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityInRegion ?region .
  FILTER(?city = :Portland)   # Replace :Portland with the URI of the desired city
}

This query returns the region in which the specified city is located.
