**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves the region in which a given city is located (assuming the city is identified by its URI):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?region
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City ;
        :locatedIn ?region .
  # Optionally, to target a specific city, e.g., Portland:
  # FILTER(?city = <http://www.example.org/test#Portland>)
}
