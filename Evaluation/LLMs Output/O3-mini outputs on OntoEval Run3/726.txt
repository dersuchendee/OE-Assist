**Yes**

Assuming that the region and country information are explicitly asserted using the property “:partOf” (with regions being instances of :Cl_Region and countries of :Cl_Country) and under a closed‑world assumption (only asserted facts are taken as true), we can answer the CQ “In what country is a certain region located?” by a query such as:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?region ?regionName ?country 
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region ;
          :regionName ?regionName ;
          :partOf ?country .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves each region (with its regionName) and the country it is asserted to be part of, thus supporting the CQ.
