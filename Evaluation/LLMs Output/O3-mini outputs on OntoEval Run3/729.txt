Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves regions together with the country in which they are located. Under the closed world assumption, only regions that have an explicitly asserted property linking them to a country are returned.

SELECT ?region ?regionLabel ?country ?countryLabel
WHERE {
  ?region a :Cl_Region .
  OPTIONAL { ?region rdfs:label ?regionLabel . }
  
  ?region :locatedInCountry ?regionCountry .
  ?regionCountry a :Cl_Country .
  OPTIONAL { ?regionCountry rdfs:label ?countryLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?region

This query addresses the competency question “In what country is a certain region located?” by extracting for each region (of type Cl_Region) its associated country (of type Cl_Country) as defined by the :locatedInCountry relation.
