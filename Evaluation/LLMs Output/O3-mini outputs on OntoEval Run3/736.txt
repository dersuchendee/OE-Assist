**No**  
The CQ “In what country is a certain region located?” is not fully answerable within the given reified modelling (i.e. through a connection with Cl_Membership) since the geographical aspects (regions and countries) are only modelled with direct properties rather than via a reified class. However, you can extract a partial answer using the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?region ?country
WHERE {
  ?region rdf:type :Cl_Region .
  ?region :regionInCountry ?country .
}
