**Yes**

We can answer this competency question with the following SPARQL query. This query retrieves all regions (or a specific region if you bind it) together with the country in which the region is located. For a specific region, you could add a FILTER or bind the region IRI.

  SPARQL Query:

  PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
  PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

  SELECT ?region ?country
  WHERE {
     ?region rdf:type :Cl_Region .
     ?region :regionInCountry ?country .
  }
  ORDER BY ?region

This query leverages the fact that the ontology explicitly defines the object property :regionInCountry with domain :Cl_Region and range :Cl_Country, so it fully supports the competency question under a closed world assumption.
