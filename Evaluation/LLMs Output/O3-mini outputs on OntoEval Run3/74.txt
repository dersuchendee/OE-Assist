**Yes**
Below is one SPARQL query that extracts the date for a specified theatre festival (in this example, “Roma Loves Shakespeare”):

PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?name ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival ;
            :hasName ?name ;
            :hasDate ?date .
  FILTER(?name = "Roma Loves Shakespeare"@en)
}

This query works under the closed world assumption of the ontology and retrieves the date on which the chosen theatre festival took place.
