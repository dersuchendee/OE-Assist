**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves, for each music album (record) defined in the ontology, the track(s) associated via the reification construct. If every record always appears with at least one track, then for every album an answer is returned.

SELECT ?album ?albumTitle ?track ?trackTitle

  ?album a :Cl_MusicAlbum .
  OPTIONAL { ?album :hasTitle ?albumTitle . }

ORDER BY ?album

In a closed‚Äêworld setting, if the ontology is populated with individual albums and their associated track reification records, every album should have at least one related track as required by the competency question.
