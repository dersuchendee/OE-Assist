Below is a SPARQL query that will try to retrieve any record along with its tracks (if available), even though the ontology does not explicitly model a recordâ€“track relationship.

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
 
SELECT ?record ?track
WHERE {
  ?record a :Record.
  OPTIONAL { ?record :hasTrack ?track. }
}
------------------------------------------------

This query provides a partial answer by returning any record and its associated track when present, even though the ontology does not guarantee that every record has at least one track.
