**No**

The CQ “A record always contains at least one track” is not fully supported by the ontology. Although there is a property (:containsTrack) linking a record (an instance of :Cl_Record) to a track (via :Cl_RecordTrack), the ontology does not enforce (via a cardinality or minimum restriction) that every record must have such a link. Under the closed world assumption, we cannot assume that every record has an associated track.

Below is a SPARQL query that returns, for each record, the number of tracks present. This partial answer lets you see which records (if any) do not have a track associated.

SELECT ?record (COUNT(?recordTrack) AS ?tracksCount)
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Record .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?record :containsTrack ?recordTrack .
    ?recordTrack a :Cl_RecordTrack .
  }
}
GROUP BY ?record

Using this query you can assess whether the data conforms to the competency question requirement.
