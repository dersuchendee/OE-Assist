**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves every record along with at least one track it is linked to via the property “:containsTrack”:

─────────────────────────────  
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?record ?track
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Record .
  ?record :containsTrack ?track .
}
─────────────────────────────  

This query shows that every instance of “:Cl_Record” in the ontology is required to have at least one track, thereby answering the competency question “A record always contains at least one track.”
