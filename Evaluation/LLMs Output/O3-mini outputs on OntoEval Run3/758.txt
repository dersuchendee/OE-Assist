**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that checks the CQ “A record always contains at least one track”. In a complete model that enforces this competency (using a minimum cardinality restriction on :containsTrack for all instances of :Cl_Album), this query should return no results (i.e. no record is missing a track):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?album
WHERE {
  ?album a :Cl_Album .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?album :containsTrack ?track . }
}

If this query returns an empty result set, it confirms that every record (i.e. every instance of :Cl_Album) has at least one associated track, as required by the competency question.
