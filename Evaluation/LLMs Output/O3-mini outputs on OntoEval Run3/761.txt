**Yes**

Under the closed‐world assumption this ontology ensures that every instance of :Cl_Album (i.e. a record) has at least one related :Cl_Track via the property :containsTrack (as specified by the owl:Restriction). Therefore, we can answer the CQ by writing a SPARQL query that lists each record along with its track(s):

---------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?record ?track
WHERE {
  ?record a :Cl_Album .
  ?record :containsTrack ?track .
}
ORDER BY ?record
---------------------------------

If this query returns results for all records in your data, then the competency question “A record always contains at least one track” is fully supported by your ontology.
