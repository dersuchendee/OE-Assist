**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves—for a given person—their recorded medical degrees (with names and dates), leveraging the reification pattern (using the property :hasMedicalDegree and related data properties):

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeName ?degreeDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeName ?degreeName .
  ?degree :degreeDate ?degreeDate .
}
-------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, any medical degrees for which no information appears are assumed not to exist; hence the above query fully answers the competency question.
