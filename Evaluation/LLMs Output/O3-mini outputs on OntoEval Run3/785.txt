**Yes**

Assuming that the individual representing the “certain person” (e.g. Pasquale Di Gennaro) is identified (here by its URI), the ontology supports modelling of the relationship between a person and their medical degrees through the reified class Cl_PersonMedicalDegree, which connects a Cl_Person to a Cl_MedicalDegree via the object property hasMedicalDegree (and stores, for example, the date via dateObtained). Under a closed world assumption we can assume that if such assertions are absent then the person does not have any medical degree. 

For example, the following SPARQL query retrieves the medical degrees and the date obtained for the person (here assumed to be identified as <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro>):

--------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?degree ?dateObtained
WHERE {
  ?pmd a :Cl_PersonMedicalDegree .
  ?pmd :hasPerson <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro> .
  ?pmd :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  OPTIONAL { ?pmd :dateObtained ?dateObtained . }
}
--------------------------------------

This query extracts the answer to the competency question "What medical degrees does a certain person have?" as the relationship between the person and their recorded medical degrees.
