Below is one possible SPARQL query that extracts the study period (with start and end dates) for a given person and degree from the ontology:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?studyPeriod ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person ;
          :studiedDuring ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :degreeObtained ?degree ;
               :hasStartDate ?startDate ;
               :hasEndDate ?endDate .
  
  # Uncomment and modify the following filters to restrict the query
  # to a specific person and degree:
  # FILTER(?person = :PasqualeDiGennaro)
  # FILTER(?degree = :CertifiedNurseDegree)
}
ORDER BY ?person ?startDate
--------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question "During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?" by retrieving the individual (person), the associated study period, the obtained degree, and the start and end dates of that study period under the closed world assumption.
