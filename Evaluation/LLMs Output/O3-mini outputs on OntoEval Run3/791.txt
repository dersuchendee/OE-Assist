Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the study period details (start and end dates) for persons studying for a specific degree. This query assumes a closed‐world view on the ontology, exploiting properties connecting a Person with a StudyPeriod (via ns1:hasStudyPeriod) and the association between that study period and the degree (via ns1:studiesFor):

---------------------------------------------------
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?degree ?degreeLabel ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a ns1:Person ;
          ns1:hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod ns1:hasStartDate ?startDate ;
               ns1:hasEndDate ?endDate ;
               ns1:studiesFor ?degree .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?degree rdfs:label ?degreeLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?person ?startDate

This query extracts, for each person, the associated study period (with start and end dates) and the degree they studied for, thus fully addressing the competency question: “During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?”
