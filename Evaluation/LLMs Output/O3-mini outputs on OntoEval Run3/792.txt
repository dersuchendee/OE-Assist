**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves, for each person and the degree they are studying for, the study period (start and end dates):

PREFIX : <http://example.org/medical_degrees#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person ;
          :studiesFor ?degree .
  ?degree :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :hasStartDate ?startDate ;
               :hasEndDate ?endDate .
} 
ORDER BY ?person ?startDate

This query shows that the competency question – "During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?" – is answerable from the ontology by following the reified relations between Person, Degree, and StudyPeriod under the closed-world assumption.
