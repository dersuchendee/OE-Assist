**Yes**

Based on the second modelling of study events, we can retrieve the time period in which a person studied for a given degree. Under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, we assume that only explicitly asserted connections hold. For instance, if a study event exists linking the person with the degree and a time period (with its start and end dates), the CQ is answerable. An example SPARQL query is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?startDate ?endDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :participatedInStudyEvent ?studyEvent .
  ?degree a :Cl_Degree ;
          :isDegreeOfStudyEvent ?studyEvent .
  ?timePeriod a :Cl_TimePeriod ;
              :isPeriodOfStudyEvent ?studyEvent ;
              :hasStartDate ?startDate ;
              :hasEndDate ?endDate .
  # Optionally filter for a specific person and/or degree, e.g.,
  # FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro>)
  # FILTER(?degree = <http://www.example.org/test#CertifiedNurseDegree>)
}
ORDER BY ?person ?startDate

This query extracts the person, the degree they obtained (or studied for), and the associated study period (start and end dates) as modelled by the reified study event.
