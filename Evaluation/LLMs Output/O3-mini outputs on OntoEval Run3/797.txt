**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves for a given person and degree the study period (start and end dates) during which the person studied for that degree:

----------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degreeName ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :studiedFor ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate ;
               :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate ;
               :degree ?degree .
  ?degree :degreeName ?degreeName .
  
  # Optionally, if you need to restrict to a specific person or degree, include FILTERs. For example:
  # FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#Pasquale_Di_Gennaro>)
  # FILTER(?degreeName = "Certified Nurse")
}
----------------------------------------------------

This query shows how the ontology models the study period (through :Cl_StudyPeriod along with its properties :studyStartDate, :studyEndDate, and the degree information connected via :degree and :degreeName), which makes the CQ answerable with a SPARQL query.
