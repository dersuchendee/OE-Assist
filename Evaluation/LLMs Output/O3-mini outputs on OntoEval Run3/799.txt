**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves for each person the degree and the corresponding study period (start and end dates):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  ?degree :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate .
  ?studyPeriod :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
}
ORDER BY ?person ?degree

This query extracts the complete study period for each degree associated with a person, thus answering the competency question "During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?"
