**Yes**

One can answer this CQ by retrieving, for a given person and degree, the corresponding study period by following the :hasStudyPeriod relation from the reified degree instance. For example, assuming we want to get the study period for a specific person and degree, one SPARQL query is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degreeName ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?pmDegree a :Cl_PersonMedicalDegree ;
            :personWithDegree ?person ;
            :degreeOf ?degree ;
            :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?degree :degreeName ?degreeName .
  ?studyPeriod :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate ;
               :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
  # Filter to a certain person and degree, e.g., Pasquale Di Gennaro and "Certified Nurse"
  FILTER(?person = :Pasquale_Di_Gennaro && ?degreeName = "Certified Nurse")
}

This query returns the study period (start and end dates) during which the person studied for the specific degree.
