**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves, for any given person, the medical degree(s) they have and (via the asserted study period) the start and end dates of their studies:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?degreeTitle ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate 
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasMedicalDegree ?degree .
  OPTIONAL { ?degree :degreeTitle ?degreeTitle . }
  ?degree :hasStudyPeriod ?studyPeriod .
  ?studyPeriod :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate .
  ?studyPeriod :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
}
ORDER BY ?person ?studyStartDate

This query extracts the study period associated to each degree of a person, thus fully supporting the competency question "During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?" under the closed world assumption.
