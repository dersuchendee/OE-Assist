**Yes**  
Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the study start and end dates for a given person and degree by using the reified class (Cl_StudyForDegree):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?degree ?studyStartDate ?studyEndDate
WHERE {
  ?study a :Cl_StudyForDegree ;
         :hasStudent ?person ;
         :hasDegree ?degree ;
         :studyStartDate ?studyStartDate ;
         :studyEndDate ?studyEndDate .
  # Optionally, filter by a specific person and degree:
  # FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro> && ?degree = <http://www.example.org/test#CertifiedNurse>)
}  
ORDER BY ?person ?studyStartDate

This query shows that the ontology supports the competency question “During what time period did a certain person study for a specific degree?” by retrieving the associated study period information from the reified class Cl_StudyForDegree under a closed world assumption.
