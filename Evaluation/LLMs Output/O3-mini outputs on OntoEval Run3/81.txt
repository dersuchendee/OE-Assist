**Yes**

Assuming that the “certain theatre festival” is represented as an instance of Cl_TheatreFestival and that its festival date is captured via the :hasDate property, you can extract the answer with a query such as:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasDate ?date .
  # Optionally, if the festival has a name or label, you could further filter or display it:
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?label . }
  # For a “certain” festival, you can filter by its known URI or label.
  # FILTER(?festival = <http://www.example.org/test#YourFestivalID>)
}

This query shows that the ontology does model the necessary information to answer the competency question “When did a certain theatre festival take place?” under a closed‐world assumption.
