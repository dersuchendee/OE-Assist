Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves for a given person and hospital the earliest (first) employment start date:

PREFIX : <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/hospitalemployment.owl#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?hospital ?hospitalLabel (MIN(?date) AS ?firstEmployment)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Person ;
          rdfs:label ?personLabel ;
          :hasEmploymentRecord ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?date ;
              :employedAt ?hospital .
  ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel .
  # Optionally, apply FILTERs if you want to restrict to a certain person or hospital, e.g.,
  # FILTER(?person = :PasqualeDiGennaro) 
  # FILTER(?hospital = :OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli)
}
GROUP BY ?person ?personLabel ?hospital ?hospitalLabel
ORDER BY ?firstEmployment
