**Yes**
Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the employment start date for a given person at a given hospital:

----------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?startDate) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :employedAt ?employmentEvent .
  ?employmentEvent :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
  ?employmentEvent :employmentInHospital ?hospital .
  FILTER(?person = :PasqualeDiGennaro && ?hospital = :OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli)
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
----------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
• This query looks for an individual of type Cl_Person (here PasqualeDiGennaro) linked via the property “employedAt” to an employment event.
• It retrieves the employmentStartDate from that event and ensures the event is connected to the hospital using “employmentInHospital”.
• The MIN aggregation is used in case there are multiple employment events so that the “first” (earliest) employment date is returned.
