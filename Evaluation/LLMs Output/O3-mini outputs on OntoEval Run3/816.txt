**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves, for a given person (e.g. Pasquale Di Gennaro) and a given hospital (e.g. Ospedale Riunito delle Tre Valli), the earliest employment date (i.e. when the person was first employed at that hospital). Note that under the closed-world assumption we assume that all employment events for the person at the hospital are recorded in the ontology.

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?employmentDate) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Employee .
  ?person :hasEmploymentEvent ?event .
  ?event :employmentStartDate ?employmentDate .
  
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :hasEmploymentEventAtHospital ?event .
  
  # Example filter for a specific person and hospital,
  # replace the IRIs below with the actual IRIs in your data if available:
  FILTER (?person = <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro> &&
          ?hospital = <http://www.example.org/test#OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli>)
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
ORDER BY ?firstEmploymentDate

This query finds all employment events linking the person and the hospital and then calculates the earliest employment date, thus fully answering the competency question.
