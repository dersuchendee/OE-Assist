**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed world assumption, retrieves the earliest (first) employment date for a given person at a given hospital:

---------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?employmentDate) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Employee .
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .

  # Both the person and hospital are connected to the same employment instance.
  ?person :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?hospital :hasEmployment ?employment .

  ?employment :employmentDate ?employmentDate .

  # To focus on a specific person and hospital, you can use FILTERs:
  FILTER(?person = :Pasquale_Di_Gennaro)
  FILTER(?hospital = :Ospedale_Riunito_delle_Tre_Valli)
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
---------------------------------------------------

This query selects the person and hospital and computes the minimum (earliest) employment date from the employment instances linking them, thus answering the CQ "When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?"
