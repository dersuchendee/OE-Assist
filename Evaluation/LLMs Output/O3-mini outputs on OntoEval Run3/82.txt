**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the date (when the festival took place) for a theatre festival (here assumed to be identified by its rdfs:label):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?label ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival rdfs:label ?label .
  ?festival :date ?date .
  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?label), "roma loves shakespeare"))
}

This query exploits the fact that instances of Cl_TheatreFestival are related to a date (via the :date property) and are labeled (using rdfs:label). The FILTER clause selects the “certain” festival (in this case one with a label containing "roma loves shakespeare"). Under the closed world assumption, we assume that only those individuals with an explicitly stated date will be returned.
