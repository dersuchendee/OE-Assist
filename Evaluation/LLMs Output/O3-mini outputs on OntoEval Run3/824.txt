**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that uses the ontology to retrieve the earliest employment start date of a given person at a specific hospital:

----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT (MIN(?employmentDate) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  :PasqualeDiGennaro :hasEmployment ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentStartDate ?employmentDate .
  ?employment :employedAt :OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli .
}
----------------------------------------------

In a closed‚Äêworld approach, if multiple employment records exist for the person at the hospital, the query returns the minimum (earliest) employment date, thereby answering the CQ "When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?"
