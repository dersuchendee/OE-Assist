**Yes**

The ontology contains a class for Employment along with properties (:employedPerson, :employedAt, and :employmentStartDate) that allow us to extract the first employment date for a given person at a specified hospital. Assuming the closed world (i.e. all employment events are represented), the following SPARQL query returns the minimum employment start date for that person at that hospital:

----------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT (MIN(?startDate) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment ;
              :employedPerson :Pasquale_Di_Gennaro ;
              :employedAt :Ospedale_Riunito_delle_Tre_Valli ;
              :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
}
----------------------------------------

This query confirms that the CQ "When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?" is fully supported by the ontology.
