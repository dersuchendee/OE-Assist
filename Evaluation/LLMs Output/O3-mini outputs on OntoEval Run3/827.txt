**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves for each person and hospital the earliest (minimum) employment date (i.e. when the person was first employed at that hospital):

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?employmentDate) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment ;
              :employee ?person ;
              :employedAt ?hospital ;
              :employmentDate ?employmentDate .
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
------------------------------------------------

This query shows that the ontology provides the necessary classes (Cl_Employment), properties (:employee, :employedAt, :employmentDate) and instance data so that the competency question "When was a certain person first employed at a certain hospital?" is modelled by the ontology.
