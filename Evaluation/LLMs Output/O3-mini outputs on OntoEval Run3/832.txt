**Yes**

Assuming that the individual is represented as an instance of :Cl_Person and the hospital as an instance of :Cl_Hospital, we can use the employment reification class (:Cl_Employment) with the properties :hasEmployee, :employedAt, and the data property :employmentStartDate. Under the closed world assumption, we can then extract the earliest employment date for a given person at a given hospital. For example, if we have the IRIs for the person and hospital, the SPARQL query could be:

--------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?firstEmploymentDate
WHERE {
  ?employment a :Cl_Employment ;
              :hasEmployee ?person ;
              :employedAt ?hospital ;
              :employmentStartDate ?date .
  FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro> &&
         ?hospital = <http://www.example.org/test#OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli>)
}
ORDER BY ASC(?date)
LIMIT 1
--------------------------------------------

This query returns the earliest start date (i.e. when the person was first employed) at the specified hospital.
