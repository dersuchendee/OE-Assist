**Yes**

Assuming that the unique employment record is modelled via the reification class :Cl_Employment linked from a person via the property :employedAt (with its associated :employmentHospital and :employmentStartDate), you could retrieve the first employment date for a given person at a given hospital with a query like:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?hospital (MIN(?startDate) AS ?firstEmploymentDate)
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?person :employedAt ?employment .
  ?employment :employmentHospital ?hospital ;
              :employmentStartDate ?startDate .
  # These filters represent the “certain person” and “certain hospital”
  FILTER(?person = <http://www.example.org/test#YourPersonIRI> &&
         ?hospital = <http://www.example.org/test#YourHospitalIRI>)
}
GROUP BY ?person ?hospital
------------------------------------------------

This query demonstrates that the competencies in the CQ are modelled in the ontology and, under the closed world assumption, the answer is extractable.
