**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption, retrieves each hospital along with its city (and optionally their labels):

PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital a ns1:Hospital ;
            ns1:locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}

This query directly extracts the answer to the CQ "In what city is a certain hospital located?" by following the property ns1:locatedIn, which connects the hospital to its city.
