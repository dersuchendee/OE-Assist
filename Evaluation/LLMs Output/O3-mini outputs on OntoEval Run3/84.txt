**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that retrieves the dates on which theatre festivals took place, using the fact that each festival has an occurrence (via :hasOccurrence) with an associated date (via :hasDate):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival rdf:type :Cl_Festival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :hasDate ?date .
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query is answerable under the closed world assumption given the ontology, and it extracts the date information for each festival occurrence (including “Roma Loves Shakespeare”).
