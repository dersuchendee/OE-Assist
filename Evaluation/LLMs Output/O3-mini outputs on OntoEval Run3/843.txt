**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves hospitals along with the cities in which they are located:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
  
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?location .
  ?location :city ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query checks that an instance of the class Cl_Hospital is linked (via the property :locatedIn) to a location which, in turn, is connected through the property :city to a city. This shows that the CQ "In what city is a certain hospital located?" is answerable by the ontology under the closed world assumption.
