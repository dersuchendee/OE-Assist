**Yes**

We can retrieve a hospitalâ€™s city by querying for its linked location and extracting the city name. For example, assuming that hospitals are typed as :Cl_Hospital, the location is linked via the property :locatedIn and has a data property :cityName, the following SPARQL query answers the competency question:

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?location .
  ?location :cityName ?cityName .
}
----------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, this query will extract the city (e.g. "Nocera Inferiore") where the hospital (e.g. OspedaleRiunitoDelleTreValli) is located.
