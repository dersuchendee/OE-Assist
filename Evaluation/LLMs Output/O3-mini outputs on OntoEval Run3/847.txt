**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world view (i.e. only looking at explicitly asserted triples), will return each hospital and the city in which it is located:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital rdf:type :Cl_Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel. }
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel. }
}

This query answers the competency question “In what city is a certain hospital located?” by directly retrieving the hospital instance and its associated city from the ontology.
