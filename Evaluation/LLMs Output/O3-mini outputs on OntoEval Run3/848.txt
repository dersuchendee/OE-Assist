**Yes**

Below is a sample SPARQL query that retrieves, for each hospital in the ontology, the city where it is located (using the property “locatedIn” with #Cl_Hospital as domain and #Cl_City as range):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?hospital ?hospitalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?hospital a :Cl_Hospital .
  OPTIONAL { ?hospital rdfs:label ?hospitalLabel . }
  ?hospital :locatedIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}

This query shows that the competency question “In what city is a certain hospital located?” is answerable with the given ontology under the closed world assumption.
