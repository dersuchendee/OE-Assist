**No**
Below is a SPARQL query that extracts a partial answer by retrieving the cityâ€™s name and the country it is linked to via the :isLocatedIn property:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?city ?cityName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City ;
        :cityName ?cityName ;
        :isLocatedIn ?country .
  ?country :countryName ?countryName .
  # You can filter for a specific city by its name if needed:
  # FILTER(?cityName = "Nocera Inferiore")
}

This CQ is only partially answerable using the given ontology because the geographic aspect is not connected via a reified class (for example one like Cl_Membership) as required by the reification competency.
