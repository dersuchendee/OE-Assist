**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that uses the reified “city location” pattern defined in the ontology to extract, for each city, the country in which it is located. (Under the closed‐world assumption, if a city does not have an associated reified location then it is assumed not to “be located” in any country.)

SELECT ?city ?cityName ?country ?countryName
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?country a :Cl_Country .
  
  # Retrieve the reified instance that connects a city to a country
  ?city :cityLocation ?cityLocation .
  ?cityLocation :locationCountry ?country .
  
  # Optionally retrieve the city and country names 
  OPTIONAL { ?city :cityName ?cityName. }
  OPTIONAL { ?country :countryName ?countryName. }
}

This query shows that the competency question “In what country is a certain city located?” can be answered using the reification pattern provided in the ontology.
