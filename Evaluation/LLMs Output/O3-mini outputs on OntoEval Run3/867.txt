**Yes**

We can extract the answer because the ontology defines the property “locatedIn” with a domain of Cl_City and a range of Cl_Country. For any city (instance of Cl_City) that is linked via “locatedIn” to a country, we can retrieve the country.

For example, the following SPARQL query answers the CQ:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :locatedIn ?country .
}
