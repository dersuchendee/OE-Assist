**Yes**

We can answer the CQ “In what country is a certain city located?” because the ontology includes a class for cities (:Cl_City), a class for countries (:Cl_Country), and an object property (:isLocatedIn) with domain :Cl_City and range :Cl_Country. Assuming the closed world, we know that a given city individual (for example, :NoceraInferiore) is related via :isLocatedIn to a country (for example, :Italy).

Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves, for each city, the country in which it is located:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city rdf:type :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
}
