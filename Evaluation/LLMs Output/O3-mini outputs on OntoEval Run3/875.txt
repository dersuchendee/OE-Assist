**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the country in which a given city is located:

─────────────────────────────

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :isLocatedIn ?country .
  # Optionally filter for a specific city by label
  # ?city rdfs:label "NameOfCity" .
}

─────────────────────────────

This query takes into account the closed world assumption and uses the property :isLocatedIn (with domain Cl_City and range Cl_Country) to extract the country where a city (or a certain city, when further filtered) is located.
