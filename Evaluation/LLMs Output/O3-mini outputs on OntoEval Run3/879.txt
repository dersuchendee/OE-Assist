**Yes**

The query below retrieves all cities and the country they are located in, using the property that links a city to its country:

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?city ?country
WHERE {
  ?city a :Cl_City .
  ?city :cityInCountry ?country .
}
------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption the absence of a triple (i.e. a cityâ€™s country not explicitly declared) is considered to mean that the relation does not hold. This SPARQL query thus answers the competency question "In what country is a certain city located?" based on the ontology provided.
