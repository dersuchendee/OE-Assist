**No**

The ontology does not fully model the temporal dimension of union membership. While it provides properties that relate employees to unions (through :representsUnion) and indicates when an employee became a union representative (via :unionRepresentativeSince), it does not generally capture union membership with associated validity periods. Therefore, we can only extract a partial answerâ€”namely, employees who represent a union and whose representation started before a given point in time.

Below is a SPARQL query that, given an input date (here exemplified as "2005-01-01"), returns employees representing a union as of that date. (You can replace the fixed date with a parameter if needed.)

WHERE {
  ?employee a :Employee ;
            :representsUnion ?union ;
            :unionRepresentativeSince ?unionRepSince .
  OPTIONAL { ?employee rdfs:label ?employeeLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?union rdfs:label ?unionLabel . }
  
  FILTER(xsd:date(?unionRepSince) <= xsd:date("2005-01-01"))
}
ORDER BY ?employee

This query only partially answers the original CQ by extracting union representatives with the necessary temporal condition, not all union members.
