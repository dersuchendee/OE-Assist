**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, returns the persons who are members of a given union (here, for example, ns1:MaleNurseUnion) at a specified point in time (here, provided as a fixed date, which you can adjust):

---------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX time: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?name
WHERE {
  ?person ns1:memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership ns1:hasUnion ns1:MaleNurseUnion .
  ?membership ns1:hasMembershipPeriod ?period .
  ?period time:hasBeginning ?start .
  OPTIONAL { ?period time:hasEnd ?end . }
  
  # Specify the point in time to check (adjust the value as needed)
  BIND(xsd:dateTime("2002-06-01T00:00:00Z") AS ?givenTime) .
  
  # Return only those memberships active at the given time (if no end date, assume still active)
  FILTER ( ?givenTime >= ?start && ( !BOUND(?end) || ?givenTime <= ?end ) )
  
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?name . }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question by using the reified union membership data (with its time interval) to filter members of a specific union at a given point in time.
