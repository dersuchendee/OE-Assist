**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the members of a given union (identified by its IRI or label) that were associated “at” a specified point in time. (Adjust the filter value for the specific time as needed.)

PREFIX : <http://example.org/union#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?union ?unionLabel ?member ?memberLabel ?time
WHERE {
  ?union a :Union .
  OPTIONAL { ?union rdfs:label ?unionLabel . }
  ?union :hasMemberAt ?member .
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
  ?union :atTime ?time .
  FILTER( ?union = <http://example.org/union#YourUnionIRI> && ?time = "2002-01-01"^^xsd:date )
}
  
ORDER BY ?union ?time

In this query we assume that (1) unions are linked to their members via the property :hasMemberAt and (2) the time qualification is captured via the :atTime relationship (as required by the ontology’s restrictions on these properties). This enables answering the CQ “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” over the given ontology.
