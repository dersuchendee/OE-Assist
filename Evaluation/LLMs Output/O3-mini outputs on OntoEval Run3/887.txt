**Yes**

Assuming that unions, their memberships, and associated time periods are explicitly asserted in the ontology, we can extract the union’s members at a given time using the reified membership information. For example, let “Union X” be the targeted union and “?queryTime” be the given time point. Under the closed‐world assumption, we assume that a union membership is valid only if a time period is explicitly defined and the queried time falls between the membership’s start and end dates.

A possible SPARQL query is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?employee ?employeeLabel ?start ?end
WHERE {
  # Identify the target union using its label (adjust the filter value as needed)
  ?union a :Cl_Union ;
         rdfs:label "Union X" .
  
  # Get a member relation indicating membership (via reified membership)
  ?union :hasMember ?membership .
  ?membership :memberDuring ?timePeriod .
  ?timePeriod :startTime ?start ;
              :endTime ?end .
              
  # Retrieve the employee who is the union member (assuming union membership is linked to an employee)
  ?employee a :Cl_Employee ;
            :hasUnionMembership ?membership .
  OPTIONAL { ?employee rdfs:label ?employeeLabel . }
  
  # Filter: the queried time point must fall within the membership period.
  FILTER(xsd:date("2003-01-01") >= ?start && xsd:date("2003-01-01") <= ?end)
}

This query returns the employees (union members) of “Union X” whose membership time period covers January 1, 2003. Adjust the union identifier and the queried time as needed.
