**Yes**

Assuming that by “a certain union” the query has a fixed union identifier (e.g. :SomeUnion) and that the “point in time” is provided as a date literal (here exemplified as "2002-01-01"^^xsd:date), the ontology supports this competency question. Under a closed‐world assumption, we require that the membership’s start date is on-or-before the queried time and its end date (if provided) is on-or-after that time.

A sample SPARQL query is:

----------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personLabel
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :union :SomeUnion .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?start .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?end . }
  
  # Define the point in time to check membership; change the date as needed.
  BIND("2002-01-01"^^xsd:date AS ?time)
  
  FILTER(?start <= ?time && (!bound(?end) || ?time <= ?end))
  
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
}
----------------------------------

This query retrieves all persons who are members of the specified union at the given point in time.
