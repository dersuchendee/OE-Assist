**Yes**

Assuming that a person’s union membership is valid from the recorded membership start date onward (and that no explicit end date is given, so under a closed‐world assumption memberships without an end date are considered valid), you can answer the CQ “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” by selecting all persons whose union membership start date is on or before that point. For example, if you want to know the members of a given union (say, :UnionOfMaleNurses) at a given date (for instance, 2005-01-01), you can run the following query:

──────────────────────────────
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personLabel ?membershipStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :hasUnionMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :memberOf :UnionOfMaleNurses .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
  
  # Select memberships that started on or before the given point in time
  FILTER(xsd:date("2005-01-01") >= ?membershipStartDate)
  
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
}
──────────────────────────────

This query will retrieve the persons (and optionally their labels) who became members of :UnionOfMaleNurses on or before January 1, 2005. Adjust the union URI and the query date as needed to answer the competency question for different unions or points in time.
