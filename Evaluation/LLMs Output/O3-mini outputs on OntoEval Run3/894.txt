Below is an example SPARQL query that, using a closed‐world assumption, selects the persons who are members of a specified union (e.g. the “Union for Male Nurses”) at a given point in time. In this query we assume the date parameter (here “2003-01-01”) represents the “certain point in time” and we keep into account that a membership is active if its start date is on or before that date and – if an end date is provided – that the given date is on or before the end date.

ORDER BY ?person

This query will return all persons whose union membership (for the specified union) is active at the given time, thus answering the competency question.
