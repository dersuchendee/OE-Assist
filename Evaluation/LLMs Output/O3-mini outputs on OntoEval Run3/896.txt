**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the persons who are (or have been) members of a given union at a given time. In this query the union (here shown as :Union_Male_Nurses) and the time (here "2003-01-01"^^xsd:date) are provided as parameters. (Under closed‐world semantics, if no membership end date is given we assume that the membership is still valid.)

SELECT DISTINCT ?person
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :unionMember ?person ;
              :memberOf ?targetUnion ;
              :membershipStartDate ?startDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?endDate . }
  
  FILTER(
    ?targetUnion = :Union_Male_Nurses &&
    xsd:date("2003-01-01") >= ?startDate &&
    ( !bound(?endDate) || xsd:date("2003-01-01") <= ?endDate )
  )
}
--------------------------------------------------------

In this example, the query returns all persons for whom a union membership exists in :Union_Male_Nurses such that the given point in time falls later than (or equal to) the membership start date and—if a membership end date is recorded—the point in time does not fall after it.
