**Yes**

Assuming that union membership is reified using the class Cl_PersonUnionMembership and that the period during which the membership holds is captured by a reified “membership period” (with, for example, properties :membershipStart and :membershipEnd), one can answer “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” with a SPARQL query such as:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?union ?unionLabel ?member ?memberLabel ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_PersonUnionMembership .
  
  ?membership :personMemberOfUnion ?member .
  OPTIONAL { ?member rdfs:label ?memberLabel . }
  
  ?membership :unionHasMember ?union .
  OPTIONAL { ?union rdfs:label ?unionLabel . }
  
  ?membership :membershipDuring ?period .
  ?period :membershipStart ?membershipStart .
  ?period :membershipEnd ?membershipEnd .
  
  # Restrict to a given union (e.g., MaleNursesUnion)
  FILTER (?union = <http://www.example.org/test#MaleNursesUnion>) .
  
  # Restrict to memberships active at a given point of time (e.g., June 1, 2002)
  FILTER ( xsd:date("2002-06-01") >= ?membershipStart && xsd:date("2002-06-01") <= ?membershipEnd )
}
ORDER BY ?member
--------------------------------------------------

This query extracts the union, its label, the member and their label, and the start/end dates of the membership period. By supplying the appropriate union IRI and date filters, the CQ is fully answerable via the ontology.
