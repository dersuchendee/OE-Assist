**Yes**
Below is an example SPARQL query that answers the question “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” using the reified union membership model in the ontology. In this query, you would replace the IRI for the target union (here “:TargetUnion”) with the specific union of interest and supply the desired date (here “?givenDate”) for which memberships are to be determined.

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_PersonUnionMembership ;
              :memberOf :TargetUnion ;
              :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate ;
              :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate .
  ?membership a :Cl_Person .  # since Cl_PersonUnionMembership is also a subclass of Cl_Person

  # Replace "2021-06-01" with the desired point in time.
  FILTER(xsd:date("2021-06-01") >= ?membershipStartDate &&
         xsd:date("2021-06-01") <= ?membershipEndDate)
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this query, we assume that a person’s union membership is valid if the given date (here "2021-06-01") is between the membershipStartDate and membershipEndDate. Adjust the union IRI and date as necessary.
