**Yes**

Assuming that “a certain theatre festival” is represented as an instance of :Cl_TheatreFestival that “hasOccurrence” a reified occurrence (an instance of :Cl_FestivalOccurrence) with the data property :occurrenceDate (of type xsd:date), the CQ is answerable under the closed world assumption. For example, you can use the following SPARQL query to extract the festival’s occurrence date:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?festival ?occurrenceDate
WHERE {
  ?festival rdf:type :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasOccurrence ?occurrence .
  ?occurrence :occurrenceDate ?occurrenceDate .
}
ORDER BY ?occurrenceDate

This query retrieves each theatre festival along with the date(s) in which it took place.
