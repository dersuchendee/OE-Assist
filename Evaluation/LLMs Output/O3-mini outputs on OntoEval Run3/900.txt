**Yes**

Below is one example SPARQL query that answers the CQ “Who are the members of a certain union at a certain point in time?” under a closed‐world assumption. In this query we assume that the union of interest is given by its IRI (here, for example purposes, we use <http://www.example.org/test#Union_X>) and that we want to check membership validity at a given date (in this example, “2002-01-01”). Adjust the union IRI and the date as needed.

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?membershipStartDate ?membershipEndDate
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership .
  ?membership :hasPerson ?person .
  ?membership :hasUnion ?union .
  ?membership :membershipStartDate ?membershipStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEndDate . }
  
  # Filter for the particular union of interest
  FILTER (?union = <http://www.example.org/test#Union_X>)
  
  # Closed world: verify that the given date falls within the membership period.
  BIND("2002-01-01"^^xsd:date AS ?givenDate) .
  FILTER ( ?givenDate >= ?membershipStartDate &&
          ( !BOUND(?membershipEndDate) || ?givenDate <= ?membershipEndDate ) )
          
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?person
--------------------------------------------------

In this query:
• We select the union membership individuals (of type :Cl_UnionMembership) that connect a person (via :hasPerson) to a union (via :hasUnion).
• We assume that each membership has a start date (membershipStartDate) and may have an end date (membershipEndDate); using a FILTER we return those memberships that are active at the given point in time.
• The closed world assumption is applied explicitly by filtering for the given date.

This demonstrates that the ontology models the required information so that the competency question is answerable with a suitable SPARQL query.
