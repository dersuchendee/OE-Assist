**Yes**
Below is a parameterized SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, extracts the union role held by a given person in a given union group at a specified point in time:

---------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?group ?role ?roleName ?membership ?start ?end
WHERE {
  # Given individual parameters – adjust IRIs and date as needed
  VALUES ?person { <http://www.example.org/test#Pasquale_DiGennaro> }
  VALUES ?group { <http://www.example.org/test#MaleNursesUnion> }
  BIND(xsd:dateTime("2002-06-01T00:00:00") AS ?givenTime)

  # Ensure that the person is a member of the union group
  ?person :partOfUnionGroup ?group .
  
  # Retrieve the reified union membership held by the person
  ?person :hasUnionMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :unionMembershipDuring ?period .
  ?period :startTime ?start .
  ?period :endTime ?end .
  
  # Check that the given time falls within the membership period
  FILTER (?givenTime >= ?start && ?givenTime <= ?end)

  # Retrieve the union role (reified via the pivot pattern)
  ?person :hasUnionRole ?role .
  ?role :roleName ?roleName .
}
---------------------------------------------------

In this query:
• The VALUES clauses allow you to specify the person and union group of interest.
• The BIND statement sets the time point (here “2002-06-01T00:00:00”) for which the membership is to be active.
• The query checks that the person is in the specified union group and has a union membership with an associated time period that covers the given date.
• Finally, it returns the role (with its name) held by that person under these conditions.

Thus, the competency question “What role does a certain person have within a certain union group at a certain point in time?” is fully answerable via this query.
