**No**

The ontology does include classes and properties for persons, union membership, and union roles (via :hasRole and :memberOf), but it does not explicitly link a union role instance to a specific union group. In our CQ the answer must “know” the role that a person holds within a specific union group at a given time. Although we can retrieve a person’s union role from the :hasRole property (with associated roleStartDate and roleEndDate for the temporal aspect) and a person’s union membership from the :memberOf property (with the linked :union identifying the union group), there is no specified connection in the ontology between the union role (in :Cl_UnionRole) and the union group (in :Cl_Union) via the membership. As a consequence the CQ is only partially answerable: one can extract the role a person holds and then separately the union the person is a member of, but the ontology does not “model” that the specific role applies to that union membership.

A partial SPARQL query that attempts to extract the available answer might be as follows (assuming closed‐world reasoning and that the given person and union group are provided by their URIs):

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?roleStartDate ?roleEndDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person .
  ?person :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :union ?union .
  
  OPTIONAL {
    ?person :hasRole ?unionRole .
    ?unionRole :role ?role .
    ?unionRole :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate .
    ?unionRole :roleEndDate ?roleEndDate .
    FILTER (
      ?givenTime >= ?roleStartDate && ?givenTime <= ?roleEndDate
    )
  }
  
  FILTER( ?person = <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro> &&
          ?union = <http://www.example.org/test#MaleNursesUnion> )
  
  BIND( "2002-01-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime AS ?givenTime )
}
------------------------------------------------------------

In this query we try to:
1. Retrieve a specific person (e.g., Pasquale Di Gennaro).
2. Retrieve his union membership with a union group (e.g., MaleNursesUnion).
3. Optionally, retrieve his union role (and its temporal boundaries) that falls on the given time.

Because the connection between the union role and the union group is not explicitly modeled, the query only produces a partial answer.
