**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for a given person and union group the role they hold at a specified time. (In practice you would supply the individual’s URI, the union group identifier, and the instant of time as parameters.)

Assuming that individual union role information is “reified” by the property :hasRole (whose range is a :Cl_UnionRole that carries a role date via :roleDate) and that the union group membership is recorded via the property :memberOf (with range :Cl_UnionMembership whose label identifies the union group), one could write a query such as:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?unionMembership ?unionLabel ?role ?roleLabel ?roleDate
WHERE {
  # Bind the person of interest (e.g., Pasquale Di Gennaro)
  BIND(:Pasquale_Di_Gennaro AS ?person) .
  OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:label ?personLabel . }

  # Retrieve the union membership the person holds and filter for a given union group.
  ?person :memberOf ?unionMembership .
  OPTIONAL { ?unionMembership rdfs:label ?unionLabel . }
  # Replace the following FILTER with the desired union group.
  FILTER(?unionLabel = "Union for Male Nurses")

  # Retrieve the reified union role information.
  ?person :hasRole ?role .
  OPTIONAL { ?role rdfs:label ?roleLabel . }
  ?role :roleDate ?roleDate .

  # Filter to check that the role was held at a given instant.
  # For example, if you want to check the role at a given date-time, you can use:
  FILTER(?roleDate <= "2002-01-01T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime)
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query the user supplies the individual (here bound to :Pasquale_Di_Gennaro), the union group (by filtering on its label “Union for Male Nurses”) and a date condition to ensure the role held is valid at that time. This SPARQL query demonstrates that the ontology supports the competency question “What role does a certain person have within a certain union group at a certain point in time?” under a reification‐pattern design.
