Below is an example SPARQL query that, given a person, a union, and a time, extracts the role that person has within the union at that time. (In this example the input parameters are hard‐coded as :PasqualeDiGennaro, :UnionOfMaleNurses, and a sample date “2005-01-01”. You could replace these with variables or filter values as needed.)

SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?roleTitle ?roleStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :hasUnionMembership ?membership .
  ?membership :memberOf ?union ;
              :hasUnionRole ?role .
  ?role :roleTitle ?roleTitle ;
        :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate .
  FILTER( ?person = :PasqualeDiGennaro &&
          ?union = :UnionOfMaleNurses &&
          xsd:date("2005-01-01") >= ?roleStartDate )
}
-------------------------------------------------

This query assumes that if the given time (here "2005-01-01") is later than or equal to the role’s start date, then that role is considered active at that point in time.
