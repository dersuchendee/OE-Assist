**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the union role held by a given person in a specified union at a given point in time. (Here we use PasqualeDiGennaro, the UnionOfMaleNurses, and the date “2002-06-01” as example parameters; these can be replaced with variables or other values as needed.)

SELECT ?roleTitle ?roleStartDate
WHERE {
  ?person a :Cl_Person ;
          :isMemberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :memberOf ?union ;
              :hasUnionRole ?role .
  ?role :roleTitle ?roleTitle ;
        :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate .
  
  FILTER(
    ?person = :PasqualeDiGennaro &&
    ?union = :UnionOfMaleNurses &&
    xsd:date("2002-06-01") >= ?roleStartDate
  )
}
--------------------------------------------------

In this query:
– We start from a person (of class Cl_Person) who is linked via :isMemberOf to a union membership.
– That membership connects via :memberOf to a union group and via :hasUnionRole to a union role.
– We then retrieve the role title (and its start date) and filter by a specified person, union, and a point in time (here “2002-06-01”, meaning that the role must have been in effect ‒ i.e. started on or before that date).

This query ensures that the competency question “What role does a certain person have within a certain union group at a certain point in time?” is fully answerable from the ontology.
