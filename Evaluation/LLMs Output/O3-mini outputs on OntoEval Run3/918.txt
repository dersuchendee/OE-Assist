**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that extracts the role a person holds within a union at a given time. (Here we assume the given time is provided as a literal — e.g. "2003-01-01"^^xsd:date – and membership records have start (and optionally end) dates so we can check the time validity.)

SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?membershipStart ?membershipEnd
WHERE {
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :unionMember ?person ;
              :memberOfUnion ?union ;
              :hasUnionRole ?role ;
              :membershipStartDate ?membershipStart .
  OPTIONAL { ?membership :membershipEndDate ?membershipEnd . }
  # Filter to include only memberships active at the given time
  FILTER (
      "2003-01-01"^^xsd:date >= ?membershipStart &&
      ( !BOUND(?membershipEnd) || "2003-01-01"^^xsd:date <= ?membershipEnd )
  )
}

This query shows that the ontology models the CQ by enabling retrieval of a person's union role (via the union membership instance) at a specific point in time under a closed world assumption.
