**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that, given a date value (here “2002-07-01”), retrieves for a specified person (e.g. :PasqualeDiGennaro) the union membership and associated role (its title and “active” period) held at that point in time:

----------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?union ?role ?roleTitle ?roleStartDate ?roleEndDate
WHERE {
  # Find a union membership for the person that is associated with a union group  
  ?membership a :Cl_UnionMembership ;
              :membershipOf ?person ;
              :memberOf ?union .
  
  # Find the union role that is attached to that membership
  ?role a :Cl_UnionRole ;
        :hasRole ?membership ;
        :roleTitle ?roleTitle ;
        :roleStartDate ?roleStartDate .
  OPTIONAL { ?role :roleEndDate ?roleEndDate . }
  
  # Filter for a specific person (e.g., PasqualeDiGennaro)
  FILTER(?person = :PasqualeDiGennaro)
  
  # Filter for the point in time of interest.
  # In a closed world, if roleEndDate is missing we assume the role is still active.
  BIND("2002-07-01"^^xsd:date AS ?queryDate)
  FILTER(?roleStartDate <= ?queryDate)
  FILTER(!BOUND(?roleEndDate) || ?roleEndDate >= ?queryDate)
}
ORDER BY ?person
----------------------------------------------

This query “models” the competency question because it extracts the role that a specified person holds within a given union group at a specified point in time.
