**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that—in a closed‐world setting—retrieves the union role of a given person within a given union at a specified point in time. In this query, you provide the URI for the person (?person), the URI for the union group (?union), and the time of interest (e.g. a literal for ?time). The query uses the union membership (linking the person to a union) and the corresponding union role (with its start and end dates) to check which role was active at the given time.

For example:

—————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?person ?membership ?unionRole ?role ?roleStart ?roleEnd
WHERE {
  # Specify the particular person and union group
  VALUES ?person { <http://www.example.org/test#PasqualeDiGennaro> }
  VALUES ?union { <http://www.example.org/test#SomeUnionGroup> }
  
  # Person must be a member of the union
  ?person :memberOf ?membership .
  ?membership :membershipUnion ?union .
  
  # Get the union role held by the person (the reification class instance)
  ?person :hasUnionRole ?unionRole .
  ?unionRole :roleInUnion ?role .
  ?unionRole :roleStartDate ?roleStart .
  ?unionRole :roleEndDate ?roleEnd .
  
  # Filter: the given time (e.g., "2005-06-01"^^xsd:date) must fall within role dates
  FILTER ( "2005-06-01"^^xsd:date >= ?roleStart && "2005-06-01"^^xsd:date <= ?roleEnd )
}
ORDER BY ?person

This query answers the CQ by extracting the role held by a given person within a specified union at a certain point in time.
