**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that, given a specific doctor and employee, extracts the evaluation statement written by that doctor for that employee:

-------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/hospital.owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?evaluation ?evalLabel
WHERE {
  ?doctor a :Doctor .
  ?employee a :Employee .
  ?doctor :hasEvaluation ?evaluation .
  ?evaluation :evaluationOf ?employee .
  OPTIONAL { ?evaluation rdfs:label ?evalLabel . }
  # To restrict for a particular doctor and employee, uncomment and set their URIs:
  # FILTER (?doctor = <http://example.org/yourDoctorURI> && ?employee = <http://example.org/yourEmployeeURI>)
}
-------------------------------------------------------

Using the closed world assumption, the ontology provides enough explicit connections (via :hasEvaluation and :evaluationOf properties) so that the evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee is answerable.
