**Yes**

Assuming that individual evaluations are represented as instances of the Evaluation class having properties that link them to the doctor who gave the statement (via :givenBy) and to the employee for whom the statement was given (via :givenFor), we can write a query that—under a closed‐world assumption—retrieves the evaluation statement for a specific doctor and employee. For example, if we assume that the doctor and employee are identified by specific URIs (here using placeholders <http://example.org/hospital#Doctor123> and <http://example.org/hospital#Employee456>), the query would be as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/hospital#>

SELECT ?evaluation
WHERE {
  ?evaluation a :Evaluation ;
              :givenBy <http://example.org/hospital#Doctor123> ;
              :givenFor <http://example.org/hospital#Employee456> .
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

This SPARQL query shows that the ontology models the competency question because it allows us to extract the evaluation statement (i.e. the Evaluation instance) given by a particular doctor for a particular employee.
