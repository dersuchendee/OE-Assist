**No**

The ontology defines classes and properties for evaluation statements (through :Cl_EvaluationStatement, :hasEvaluationStatement and :evaluates) but does not model a clear “doctor” individual (or reified connection) that distinguishes a doctor from a general person (our only individual, :PasqualeDiGennaro, is typed as an employee). Under the closed‐world assumption no information explicitly ties a specific doctor to an evaluation statement for a specific employee. Thus the CQ “What is the evaluation statement given by a certain doctor for a certain employee?” is only partially answerable.

A partial SPARQL query to extract any available evaluation statement information is:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?doctor ?evaluationText ?evaluationDate ?employee
WHERE {
  ?doctor :hasEvaluationStatement ?eval .
  ?eval :evaluationText ?evaluationText .
  ?eval :evaluationDate ?evaluationDate .
  ?eval :evaluates ?employee .
}

This query attempts to retrieve evaluation details even though, under the current closed‐world assumption, the ontology lacks explicitly modeled doctor individuals (and thus a complete reified evaluation statement connection).
