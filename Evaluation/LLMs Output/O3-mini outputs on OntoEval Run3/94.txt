**Yes**

Assuming that a “certain theatre festival” is identified as an instance of Cl_TheatreFestival and that its occurrence date is captured by the data property :hasDate, you can retrieve its date with a query like the one below (under a closed world assumption):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?date
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_TheatreFestival .
  ?festival :hasDate ?date .
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This query retrieves all instances of Cl_TheatreFestival along with their associated dates, thus answering the competency question “When did a certain theatre festival take place?”
