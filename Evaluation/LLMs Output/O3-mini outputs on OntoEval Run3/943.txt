**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the evaluation statement given by a doctor to an employee. In this example the query assumes you want to retrieve an evaluation where the evaluation individual is of type Cl_Evaluation and it connects a doctor (via the :evaluatedBy property) to an employee (via the :evaluationOf property). You can add FILTER conditions for a “certain doctor” and “a certain employee” if needed.

SELECT ?doctor ?employee ?evaluationStatement
WHERE {
  ?evaluation a :Cl_Evaluation ;
              :evaluationStatement ?evaluationStatement ;
              :evaluatedBy ?doctor ;
              :evaluationOf ?employee .
  # For example, if you are interested in a specific doctor and employee, add:
  # FILTER(?doctor = :SomeDoctor && ?employee = :SomeEmployee)
}

This query extracts the evaluation statement (and also the doctor and employee) from the ontology, demonstrating that the CQ is fully modelled by the ontology.
