**Yes**
Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under a closed‚Äêworld assumption, retrieves the articles composing a specified book or CD (here we assume the instance is known or provided):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?bookOrCD ?bookTitle ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  ?bookOrCD a ?collectionType .
  FILTER(?collectionType IN (:Cl_Book, :Cl_CD))
  OPTIONAL { ?bookOrCD :dp_hasTitle ?bookTitle. }
  ?bookOrCD :op_composedOf ?article.
  ?article :dp_hasTitle ?articleTitle.
}
--------------------------------------------------

This query finds all individuals classified as either a book or a CD (from the article collection classes) and then retrieves the articles they are composed of along with their titles.
