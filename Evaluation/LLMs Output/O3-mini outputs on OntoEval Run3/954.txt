**Yes**
Below is a SPARQL query that, given a specific publication that is either a book or a CD, extracts the articles composed in it:

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?publication ?pubLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  VALUES ?pubType { :Cl_Book :Cl_CD }
  ?publication a ?pubType .
  OPTIONAL { ?publication rdfs:label ?pubLabel . }
  ?publication :containsArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
}
ORDER BY ?publication
--------------------------------------------------

This query leverages the ontologyâ€™s :containsArticle property whose domain is defined as :Cl_Publication (including :Cl_Book and :Cl_CD) and range as :Cl_Article. Hence the competency question is answerable by this query under the given closed world assumption.
