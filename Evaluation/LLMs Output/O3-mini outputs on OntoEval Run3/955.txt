**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under a closed world assumption (i.e. assuming that all relationships are explicitly asserted), retrieves the articles that are members of a specific Book or CD from the ontology:

--------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://example.org/ontology#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?collection ?article ?articleTitle
WHERE {
  # Select only instances that are either a Book or a CD
  ?collection rdf:type ?collectionType .
  FILTER(?collectionType = :Book || ?collectionType = :CD) .

  # Retrieve the articles that are members of the collection via the hasMember property
  ?collection :hasMember ?article .

  # Optionally, get a title for the article if provided
  OPTIONAL { ?article :title ?articleTitle }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------

This query answers the competency question "What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?" by retrieving the collection (Book or CD) along with each article that is a member of that collection and its title if available.
