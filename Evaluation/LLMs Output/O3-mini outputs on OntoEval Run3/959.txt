Below is one possible SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves for a given book or CD (of type Cl_BookOrCD) the articles it is composed of by following the :composedOf relations—from the book/CD to its “composition” and then from the composition to the article.

SELECT ?book ?bookLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  # Select the specific book or CD (modify the FILTER or VALUE as needed)
  ?book a :Cl_BookOrCD .
  OPTIONAL { ?book rdfs:label ?bookLabel. }
  
  # Get the associated composition entity from the book/CD
  ?book :composedOf ?composition .
  
  # From the composition, obtain the article (given the restriction that
  # every Cl_Composition must have a composedOf relation to some Cl_Article)
  ?composition :composedOf ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel. }
}

This query shows that the competency question “What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?” is answerable by the ontology.
