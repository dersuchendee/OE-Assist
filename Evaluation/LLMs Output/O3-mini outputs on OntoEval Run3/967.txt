**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that, under a closed‐world assumption, retrieves the articles contained in a specific publication (either a book or a CD) by using the property “containsArticle” defined with a domain that is the union of Cl_Book and Cl_CD.

------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?publication ?pubLabel ?article ?articleLabel
WHERE {
  # Select a publication that is either a book or a CD
  ?publication a ?pubType .
  FILTER(?pubType IN (:Cl_Book, :Cl_CD)) .
  OPTIONAL { ?publication rdfs:label ?pubLabel . }
  
  # Retrieve the articles composed in the publication
  ?publication :containsArticle ?article .
  OPTIONAL { ?article rdfs:label ?articleLabel . }
  
  # In a closed-world scenario, we assume the information is complete.
}
------------------------------------------------

This query will answer the competency question “What articles is a specific book or CD composed of?” by extracting the article components linked to that publication.
