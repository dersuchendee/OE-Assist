**Yes**

Below is a SPARQL query that extracts the city where a given festival (for example, “Roma Loves Shakespeare”) took place:

-------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/theatre_ontology#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?city ?cityLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a :TheatreFestival ;
            rdfs:label "Roma Loves Shakespeare" ;
            :tookPlaceIn ?city .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel . }
  OPTIONAL { ?city rdfs:label ?cityLabel . }
}
-------------------------------------------------

Under the closed world assumption, since the ontology explicitly connects the festival with its location via the :tookPlaceIn property, the competency question is fully answerable by the ontology.
