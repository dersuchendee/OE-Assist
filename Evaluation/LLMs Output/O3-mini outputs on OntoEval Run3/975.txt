**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the total number of pages for a given book (in this case, “Nurse practices in cancer patient care – longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals”, represented by ns1:NursePracticesInCancerPatientCare):

PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?label ?totalPages
WHERE {
  ?book a ns1:Book ;
        ns1:hasTotalPages ?totalPages ;
        rdfs:label ?label .
  FILTER(?book = ns1:NursePracticesInCancerPatientCare)
}

This query is answerable by the ontology under a closed world assumption since the Book class and the data property ns1:hasTotalPages are explicitly defined, enabling retrieval of the required information for the specified book instance.
