**Yes**

We can extract the number of pages for books using the :hasNumberOfPages property defined for :Cl_Book. For instance, if you want to retrieve the book (using its title) and its number of pages, you could use the following SPARQL query (under the closed world assumption):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?title ?pages 
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book ;
        :hasNumberOfPages ?pages ;
        :title ?title .
  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?title), "nurse practices in cancer patient care"))
}

This query returns the particular bookâ€™s identifier, title, and its number of pages, thus fully supporting the competency question.
