**Yes**

Below is one SPARQL query that, under the closed‐world assumption, retrieves the page count for each book (and in particular you can filter or inspect the one of interest):

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :hasPageCount ?pageCount .
}
  
This query shows that the competency question “How many pages does a particular book contain?” is answerable using the ontology provided.
