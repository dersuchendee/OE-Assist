**Yes**

Below is one example of a SPARQL query that retrieves the city where a given festival (for example, "Roma Loves Shakespeare") took place using the ontology’s concepts and relations:

—————————————————————————————
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalName ?city ?cityName
WHERE {
  ?festival a :Cl_FestivalOccurrence ;
            :hasName ?festivalName ;
            :occursIn ?city .
  ?city :hasName ?cityName .
  FILTER(?festivalName = "Roma Loves Shakespeare")
}
—————————————————————————————

This query works under a closed world assumption on the ontology and extracts the festival occurrence along with its associated city (location), answering the competency question.
