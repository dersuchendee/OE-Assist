**Yes**

The ontology models the competency question because it includes a subclass of publication (Cl_Book) that has a data property (pageNumber) capturing the number of pages, which allows us to write a SPARQL query to retrieve that information from a known book (e.g., the “Nurse practices in cancer patient care” publication).

Below is a SPARQL query that extracts the book’s title and its page number:

------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?book ?publicationTitle ?pageNumber
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Cl_Book .
  OPTIONAL { ?book :publicationTitle ?publicationTitle . }
  ?book :pageNumber ?pageNumber .
}
------------------------------------------------------------

This query returns the book(s) in the ontology along with their publication titles (if available) and how many pages they contain.
