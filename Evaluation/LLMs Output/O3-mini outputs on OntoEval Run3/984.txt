**Yes**

We can answer this CQ using the ontology’s representation of a book as an instance of Cl_Publication that has a data property :pageCount. For example, assuming a particular book is identified by its title, we could write the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?title ?pageCount
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Publication ;
        :publicationType "Book" ;
        :publicationTitle ?title ;
        :pageCount ?pageCount .
  FILTER(?title = "Nurse practices in cancer patient care – longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals")
}

This query extracts the number of pages (pageCount) for the book with the given title.
