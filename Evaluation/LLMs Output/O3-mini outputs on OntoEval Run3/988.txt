**Yes**

Below is an example SPARQL query that retrieves the number of pages for a particular book (here assumed to be identified as :Book_1):

-----------------
PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_ArticleCollection .
  ?book :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages .
  FILTER(?book = :Book_1)
}
-----------------

This query assumes that the book is modelled as an instance of :Cl_ArticleCollection (which, by the ontology design, is a kind of book) and that its number of pages is stored using the :numberOfPages data property.
