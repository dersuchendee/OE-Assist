**Yes**

Assuming the ontology is complete under a closed world assumption and the book is represented as an instance of :Cl_Book with associated properties (such as :bookTitle and :numberOfPages), you can retrieve the number of pages for a book (or all books) with the following SPARQL query:

PREFIX : <http://www.example.org/test#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?bookTitle ?numberOfPages
WHERE {
  ?book a :Cl_Book .
  ?book :bookTitle ?bookTitle .
  ?book :numberOfPages ?numberOfPages .
}

This query extracts the title and the number of pages for each book in the ontology, which answers the CQ "How many pages does a particular book contain?"
