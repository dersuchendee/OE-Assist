Below is a SPARQL query that retrieves the location of a festival (using the property ns1:tookPlaceIn defined for ns1:TheatreFestival):

--------------------------------------------------
PREFIX ns1: <http://example.org/ontology/theatre#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?festival ?festivalLabel ?location ?locationLabel
WHERE {
  ?festival a ns1:TheatreFestival .
  OPTIONAL { ?festival rdfs:label ?festivalLabel. }
  ?festival ns1:tookPlaceIn ?location .
  OPTIONAL { ?location rdfs:label ?locationLabel. }
}
