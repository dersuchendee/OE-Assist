**Yes**

The ontology supports this competency question since both Book and CD (which are subclasses of Publication) have the property ns1:hasPublicationDate that specifies the publication date. Here is a SPARQL query that retrieves the publication dates for instances of either Book or CD:

PREFIX ns1: <http://www.example.org/ontology/hospital#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?publication ?pubDate
WHERE {
  { ?publication a ns1:Book . }
  UNION
  { ?publication a ns1:CD . }
  ?publication ns1:hasPublicationDate ?pubDate .
}
