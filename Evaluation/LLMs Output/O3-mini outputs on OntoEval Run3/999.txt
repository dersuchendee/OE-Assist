**Yes**

Below is one possible SPARQL query that retrieves a book or CD along with its publication date:

----------------------------------------
PREFIX ac: <http://example.org/articlecollection#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?collection ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  {
    ?collection a ac:Book .
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?collection a ac:CD .
  }
  ?collection ac:hasPublicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
----------------------------------------

This query assumes a closed world such that if a resource is explicitly stated to be a Book or a CD and has a publication date (using the property ac:hasPublicationDate), then the answer to “When was a certain book or CD published?” is extractable from the ontology.
