In this scenario Paul has to plan a similar restoration. However, from his already extensive knowledge about organs, he is uncertain about some of the information that was provided by the encyclopaedia. That is, some of the mentioned components and technicalities such as the pitch seemed illogical when compared to the other organs from the same organ builder. If it would somehow be possible to mark facts that are unreliable or untrue, that would save Paul a lot of time checking, verifying, and notating.
Ortenz wants to characterize children’s experience of music as witnessed in bibliographic and artistic sources. She is looking for primary sources (e.g. Personal journals, literary texts) wherein to find evidence of listening experiences.

She needs to collect and analyze large corpora of texts and images recording or depicting children’s experience with music. Documents include official sources (e.g. newspaper articles, reviews of concerts, paintings) and sources produced by “ordinary people”. She prefers the latter as they provide more reliable feedback, and she looks at the context of production of such sources (where, when, who created the source, the goal, which related events exist), contents (recurring motifs and themes), and elicited emotional responses. She collects sources belonging to different historical periods so as to characterize the development of identified phenomena.",yes,/content/OntoEval-main/OntologyFiles/Memoryless CQbyCQ/SOURCECQ1.ttl

Keoma therefore needs to know what kind of sound practices are performed in each bell tower, starting with the names of the Churches given in a list.

Keoma begins to search for the location and the address of each church, also to understand if it is an urban, peri-urban or rural context.

Keoma needs to know if in each of the churches the practices of sound are currently practiced by moving the bells manually or electrically.

Furthermore, for static calculations he needs to know with which mounting system each bell is attached, its weight, its measurements and the material it is made of.

Keoma also needs to know if there are sound documents of the musical performances carried out in the different bell towers, to document the use of the bells in different events.

To do this, Keoma would have to resort to numerous searches: bibliographic sources, archival sources, field surveys and interviews with informed people.
