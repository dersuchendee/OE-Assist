During each year a number of theatre festivals are held in cities around Italy. In January 2007 a festival called “Roma Loves Shakespeare” took place in Rome. Two different productions of “The Merchant of Venice” participated, one from a theatre in Pisa and the other from a theatre institute in Venice, featuring an ensemble of university art students. Other plays were Othello and a Midsummer Night’s Dream.
The Grand Theatre in Rome offers two theatre shows each evening during September and October 2009. The play set up in this period is the ""Merchant of Venice"",given through an ensemble of well-known Italian actors. The Merchant of Venice was written during 1596 to 1598 by William Shakespeare, and it has 5 distinct acts. The premier of this production at The Grand Theatre was on September 7. Il Gazzettino gave the setup of the play 5 stars in a recent review.
Fabio Bianchi is an Italian actor employed at the theatre since May 2004, he is a part of the ensemble setting up the Merchant of Venice and he plays the Duke of Venice but also a servant in one of the scenes. During the second and third week of September the role of Shylock is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger as a special guest actor."," Context is about theatre productions where individuals, exemplified by actors in Shakespearean plays, assume multiple roles across diverse productions and festivals at specific points in time.",theatre_memless_CQbyCQ_o1_preview.ttl,o1-preview,Easy,W,,Yes,test/1test.txt,no (minor),no,yes,,Test Ex,A

Ortenz is supervising a PhD student. They want to explore a database of prosopographic information of personalities relevant to the musical cultural heritage, focusing primarily on musicians’ career but also involving relevant people in sectors such as art, politics, and industry. They are interested in the events and facts nad how they are linked to the sources (biographies, letters, memoirs, encyclopedia). She wants the system to allow her to make annotations on the content, rate the quality of the sources and the accuracy of the statements, and curate collections of facts/statements/events as material for scholarship.

David is interested in understanding the social history of music, e.g. who were the musicians, who was the audience, how did a particular musical environment relate to the wider musical environment. He has a particular interest in understanding the environment around music which would not be classified as ‘elite’ music. He is also interested in people’s experience of listening to music.
David will work for several years collecting information, e.g. about brass bands, and populating a database with this information, as a preparation for writing a book.

1373,BellCQ11,,Is there a single bell or a poliorganic instrument (a set of bells) in a church/bell tower?,,,"Patrizia is a Demo-Ethno-anthropologist Officer of the Ministry of Culture and she is responsible for the safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage pursuant to the 2003 Unesco Convention. She needs to know if the bells of some bell towers are involved in sound practices conducted by collective social actors who recognize those practices as constitutive trait of their collective identity. Patrizia starts her investigation from the denominations and the location of the bell towers. Patrizia checks whether the sound of those bell towers is done by hand or through electrification. Patrizia checks if there are more or less formalized and more or less recognized human groups that carry out those practices. Patrizia investigate what kind of transmission and apprenticeship methods are carried out: in what age groups, if exclusively male or even female, with what type of transmission (oral, written, formal or informal).

Keoma has to elaborate a restructuring plan for various bell towers and wants to know what kind of interventions to implement on the wall structure respecting the characteristics related to the use of the bell cell as a component of the production of the sound of the bells, and respecting traditional local sound practices.

Keoma therefore needs to know what kind of sound practices are performed in each bell tower, starting with the names of the Churches given in a list.

Keoma begins to search for the location and the address of each church, also to understand if it is an urban, peri-urban or rural context.

Keoma needs to know if in each of the churches the practices of sound are currently practiced by moving the bells manually or electrically.

Furthermore, for static calculations he needs to know with which mounting system each bell is attached, its weight, its measurements and the material it is made of.

Keoma also needs to know if there are sound documents of the musical performances carried out in the different bell towers, to document the use of the bells in different events.

To do this, Keoma would have to resort to numerous searches: bibliographic sources, archival sources, field surveys and interviews with informed people.

Thanks to Polifonia, Keoma can carry out these searches automatically, through a keyword search, retrieving these data in a short time.",Context is about safeguarding bell tower sound practices and restoring bell towers while preserving tradition.,https://github.com/polifonia-project/bells-ontology/blob/main/ontology/bells.owl,Human,Hard,W,,No,10test.txt,yes,yes,Test Ex,maybe,Test Ex,B
