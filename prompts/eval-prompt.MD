# Prompt Used for Ontology Evaluation via CQ Verification

This file documents the full prompt used for evaluating whether an ontology models a competency question (CQ) based on a provided ontology story (OS). The evaluation was performed via CQ verification: a CQ is considered modelled by an ontology if it is possible to write a SPARQL query that extracts the answer. The evaluation is conducted under a closed world assumption. This prompt was used in both automatic and user-based experiments.

The full prompt, including task instructions and examples, is reproduced below.

<instructions>  
Your task is to verify if an ontology is modelled by a competency question (CQ) and a story (OS). You will receive an ontology and a competency question with its story. You need to perform it via CQ verification: a competency question is modelled by an ontology if you could write a SPARQL query to extract the answer. You also need to perform closed world assumption on the ontology. If the CQ is supported by the ontology, write **Yes** (with stars) and write a SPARQL query for us. If no, write **No**  (with stars) and a SPARQL query to extract a partial answer.

OS: A regional policy practitioner is investigating how environmental factors, specifically water quality, may influence public health outcomes in their jurisdiction. The practitionerâ€™s goal is to determine whether contaminated water sources and poor water quality correlate with increased hospitalisations or adverse health outcomes.  

CQ:  What physical parameters have been recorded at each monitoring point, and how do these measurements vary over time?  

Answer: **Yes**  

{Examples}  

CQ = {CQ}  

OS: {story}  

OWL code (ontology): {OWL}  
'''  
Examples='''  
Answer: **Yes**.  
Here the CQ is answerable since the CQ is a Reification CQ (means all classes and datatypes in CQ are connected to a reified class in the ontology (Cl_Membership)). Else it is not answerable.  
```sparql
SELECT ?monitoringPoint ?mpLabel ?parameter ?parameterLabel ?time ?value
WHERE {
  ?monitoringPoint a :MonitoringPoint .
  OPTIONAL { ?monitoringPoint rdfs:label ?mpLabel . }
  
  ?monitoringPoint :hasMeasurement ?measurement .
  
  ?measurement :measuresParameter ?parameter .
  OPTIONAL { ?parameter rdfs:label ?parameterLabel . }
  
  ?measurement :hasTime ?time .
  ?measurement :hasValue ?value .
}
ORDER BY ?monitoringPoint ?time
```  

CQ: Which monitoring points have recorded measurements?  
answer: **Yes**.  
Because through a reification we can connect person and band even if this CQ can be answered by a simple connection from Person to Band  
```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?monitoringPoint ?mpLabel
WHERE {
  ?monitoringPoint a :MonitoringPoint .
  ?monitoringPoint :hasMeasurement ?measurement .
  OPTIONAL { ?monitoringPoint rdfs:label ?mpLabel . }
}
```  

CQ: What is the geographic location of each monitoring point?  
answer: **No** partial answer:  
```sparql
SELECT ?monitoringPoint ?location
WHERE {
  ?monitoringPoint a :MonitoringPoint .
}
```  

How frequently are measurements taken?  
answer: **Yes**  
```sparql
SELECT ?monitoringPoint (MIN(?time) AS ?firstMeasurement) (MAX(?time) AS ?lastMeasurement) (COUNT(?time) AS ?numMeasurements)
WHERE {
  ?monitoringPoint a :MonitoringPoint .
  ?monitoringPoint :hasMeasurement ?measurement .
  ?measurement :hasTime ?time .
}
GROUP BY ?monitoringPoint
```
